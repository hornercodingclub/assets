U.S.--President Trump's vote suppression efforts seem to know no bounds, with his main efforts focused against the USPS to stop mail-in voting. In Trump's latest attack on democracy, he is now riding around in an SUV playing "mailbox baseball" -- smashing mailboxes with a baseball bat to make it impossible for people to mail in their ballots. "Try and vote for Biden now!" Trump was heard yelling as he knocked a mailbox off its post. Trump is said to be traveling all over the country destroying mailboxes, and people are powerless to do anything. "I was going to send a letter to the police that they need to stop him," said one concerned citizen, "but I don't have a mailbox now, so I don't know what to do!" Trump has reportedly roped Vice President Pence into helping him, despite Pence's wife telling him to stay away from Trump since he is a "bad influence." "I'm not sure this is a good idea," Pence reportedly told Trump. "Plus I don't really get how this helps us, since people have to vote for us, too." "Shut up! This is my smartest idea ever!" Trump shouted back. "Now speed up! I want to send this next one flying! Oo-ee!" You must or to view or post comments on this article. You can also follow us on , and .
