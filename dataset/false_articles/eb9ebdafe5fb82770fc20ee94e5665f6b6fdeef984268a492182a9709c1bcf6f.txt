America's Shittiest Independent News Source Hanswurst University campus, Janesville, Wisconsin. JANESVILLE, Wisconsin - Chalk up one more victory for liberal fascism. Judy Pierrot was thrilled when Hanswurst University, her 'first choice school,' accepted her for the class of 2018. The 18-year-old knew from childhood that her future would somehow involve environmental work, so when she discovered renowned arts and environmental sciences school Hanswurst, everything fell into place. By high school graduation, Judy had taken so many advanced placement courses that college recruiters were contacting her. Scholarship offers were "almost an embarrassment of riches," said Judy's mother Marilyn. "The phone rang constantly." "I decided on Hanswurst the minute I got the brochure," said Judy. "I didn't bother completing my 'safety school' applications. First of all, we couldn't afford all the application fees but mostly because I knew Hanswurst was the one." All went smoothly during the university's orientation week. Things began to go awry when the new freshman registered for classes. Judy explained, "They asked me about the 'PC' class and thought they meant computer class. I said I had a Mac so I didn't need any PC classes.  They thought I was making a joke." Hanswurst U requires all first-year students to complete and pass a political correctness course.  The university adopted a "zero-tolerance policy" on cultural insensitivity after several students complained of an "oppressively Eurocentric course load, not representative of the global population." Admissions Director Milton Arbogast explained: "A group of marginalized students threatened legal action. After we met with community groups from the Chicago area, we made part of the core curriculum. It involves role-playing exercises and gives our more privileged students a taste of what our less fortunate students deal with." Judy reshuffled her schedule and enrolled in the class. Upon entering PC 111, Judy was immediately told to stand at the back of the classroom, and instructed not to speak unless spoken to. "I was confused at first," she said, "but I figured out it was a play-acting exercise, because it was a Liberal Expressions Department course." The exercises became more intense as the hour went on. Judy decided to leave when one of the instructors asked her to explain the obvious guilt she felt from being a member of a "dominant culture of privilege." "They wanted me to wear a judge's robe and they started chanting 'Judge Judy, Judge Judy.'  The whole thing was insulting.  I've never treated anyone different - so I told the instructor I wasn't going to attend any more classes and then I left." That afternoon, her scholarship was revoked and her admission was invalidated. Marilyn Pierrot drove to campus the following day to move her daughter back home. "My daughter's freedom of expression - freedom of everything was denied because some politically damn correction group got bent out of shape about something they never got because they never worked for it. They want everything handed to them!" When reached for comment, Director Arbogast replied via phone message: "Sadly, this is now a legal matter. The University maintains our commitment to equal and fair treatment for all. The course requirement was clearly outlined in student materials and we regret the unfortunate situation that led to the withdrawal of one of our students who showed great promise." will keep readers informed of future developments. Well that's just wonderful.  Kill somebody's hopes and dreams before they even get a chance to do something good with their lives and get off to a good start.  I'm sure the school didn't advertise this stupid "requirement" or else enrollment would drop like a stone!  I'm sure she'll get more offers from better schools all across the country anyway who'll give her more scholarships.  Notice they didnt' say if there was any money refunded DIRECTLY to the parents that they had to pay upfront like books and student fees, so I'm sure they lost more money than they say, but that's probably part of the "legal matter." Now they better get a good lawyer or NOT a liberal judge or jury, because if they do they may as well be better off throwing the whole thing out of court right now and not go through the bankrupt route.  What kind of attorney can they afford if she couldn't afford to apply to a more traditional school?  I know everybody will say I'm "victim blaming and all that other b.s." but why didn't the mother investigate more, especially since the school is supposedly "arts" and "environmental"?  That would be a red flag to me.  I'd start a kickstarter fund if I were them, maybe after the trial depending on how it goes.  Or sue for false advertising which maybe is in the lawsuit. They should lose their accreditation! Good. The more racism against White people, the more White people wake up and toughen up. The stronger the wind the stronger the trees. Haven't white people suffered enough? sue, sue, sue SUE SUE SUE, sue sue trying to combat PERCEIVED discrimination with outright and pervasive, institutionalized harassment, bullying and degradation to punish an innocent girl for someone else's sin? ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING Let me know where to chip in on a legal fund, sue this place right into the gutter where these trash belong, POST NAMES, let's see how they like it VENGEANCE AWAITS THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO SPREAD EVIL, sooner than you worthless dreg wastes of life can ever imagine The mother should have come up there and stuck up for her daughter instead of removing her from the school.  It's all a thing about the damn litigation culture we've been living in since the friggin yuppies started cranking out of law schools like play doh out of a goddam fun factory in the 80s.  Now this thing will drag on and on, they'll settle out of court, they'll offer to reinstate her scholarship and invite her back, she'll refuse and go somewhere else and nothing will change with the university, they'll still force people learn all this namby pamby pc bullshit so we'll all tiptoe around afraid to say anything or make a damn joke for fear of "offending" someone.  Makes me sick. wow i looked up the admissions director on google he is a complete psycho          Enter your email address to subscribe to National Report and receive notifications of new posts by email.
