NEW YORK--Ending any speculation about the top pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, the Nebraska Pioneers have reportedly informed Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o that they will select him with the first overall pick. "Coach Pfeiffer called this morning to say the Pioneers are taking me first," said Te'o, who confirmed that he has agreed to a tentative four-year, $32.5 million contract with the Omaha-based Pioneers. "Obviously, it's a huge honor, and I'm so excited to work alongside Tom Brady, Justin Smith, Calvin Johnson, and the rest of my new teammates. We're going to shake things up in the NFC Midwest this year." Sources indicated that Te'o later declined to talk with the Minnesota Vikings about drafting him 25th, telling team officials that they were "too late."
