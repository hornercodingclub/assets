THE HEAVENS--His gaze shifting from the terrestrial planet out to the expanse of the universe and then back, The Lord Almighty, Our Heavenly Father, reportedly wondered aloud Tuesday just how far He could throw the Earth. "Oh, yeah, if I got a really good windup I bet I could chuck it four or five thousand light-years," said God as He eyed the third planet from the Sun, adding that He could probably toss it right into the Pleiades star cluster with His eyes closed. "This thing weighs, what, 6 sextillion tons? With a running start, there's no way I couldn't get it past the Crab Nebula. Probably farther." At press time, the Lord was loosening up His arm by lobbing Mercury and Venus into the nearby A0620-00 black hole.
