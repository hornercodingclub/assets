WASHINGTON--Emphasizing that if Americans want in on this they need to strike while the iron is hot, United States secretary of commerce Penny Pritzker on Thursday urged the nation to get a piece of the action. "Look, there's loads of bread just waiting to be made here, but Americans need to act fast or you're going to miss out big time," said Pritzker, adding that she was offering citizens a chance to get in on the ground floor, while also stressing that the nation would need to get while the getting's good. "The cash is just lying there on the table. You want to sit around while everyone else is raking it in? Come on, America, sweet action like this doesn't come along every day. So, what's it going to be--are you in or out?" Pritzker added that if the U.S. was too chickenshit to take advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity like this, she would find some other nation that would.
