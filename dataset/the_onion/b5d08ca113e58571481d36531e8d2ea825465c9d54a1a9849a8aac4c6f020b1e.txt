WASHINGTON--In a sobering new report that lays bare a hard truth about today's economy, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed Monday that many Americans have no choice but to make ends meet by getting up and going to work every day. "There are more than 100 million adults in this nation who, to provide for themselves and their families, must wake up in the morning, get out of bed, and go to a job where they are required to complete a series of tasks assigned to them by a supervisor," the report read in part, noting that all demographic groups were equally likely to resort to almost daily employment just to scrape by. "This is the harsh reality so many are forced to grapple with. Perhaps most troubling is the fact that if they get up and go to work, they will lose their job and find themselves completely cut off from a source of income that they desperately need to keep their heads above water." The report comes on the heels of similar research that found millions of Americans had no alternative but to seek out doctors for the most basic medical care.
