NEW BEDFORD, MA--Launching an ambitious new public relations campaign across multiple media platforms, a coalition of harpoon industry executives unveiled a plan Wednesday to rebrand their product by emphasizing to the public that harpoons can harpoon stuff besides whales. "For centuries, the average consumer has assumed that harpoons, with their razor-sharp points and tenacious barbs, were only good  for shooting whales, but harpoons can also be utilized to shoot all sorts of things like, say, a home intruder or deer," said harpoon industry spokesperson Barnaby Amundson, adding that a modern harpooning setup, with its steam-powered gun emplacement and cable reel, was no longer than a compact sedan and could launch a harpoon every eight minutes when properly crewed. "The only limit to harpooning is your imagination. For instance, you can harpoon a tree, or if you're not in the mood to specifically harpoon anything, the harpoon can be fired straight up into the air. Perhaps there's something across the room or the yard that you need--impale it on a harpoon and simply reel it in. And yes, they still work on whales, but harpoon ownership is so much more than that--it's a convenience, a feeling, a whole lifestyle." Amundson was also encouraging avid harpoonists to Instagram photos of non-whale-related objects they've impaled.
