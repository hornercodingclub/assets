ATLANTA--During a brief, impromptu press conference at the agency's headquarters this morning, Centers For Disease Control director Dr. Thomas Frieden announced that Americans should start making plans to say goodbye to loved ones right away. "Citizens are advised to bid farewell to parents, children, and any other friends or family they haven't seen in a while," Frieden told reporters, adding that if you live anywhere in the Northeast, you should definitely call within the next 48 hours, if not by tonight. "If you have any unresolved emotional issues with any family member whatsoever, now is the time to work those out--I mean right now, because there will not be another chance. You don't want any regrets." Concluding his statement to the American public, Frieden said, "Dad, I love you. And I'm so sorry you never really got to know your grandson."
