CHARLOTTE, NC--Saying he was "still stressed out" from the tension of winning his fifth consecutive Sprint Cup, Hendrick Motorsports driver Jimmie Johnson unwound Tuesday by taking his No. 48 Lowe's Chevrolet for a leisurely 180 mph drive through the North Carolina countryside. "Sometimes I just like to throw on my comfy old Nomex suit and gloves, slide through the window of my Chevy, strap on the HANS device, buckle into that five-point racing harness, and just go," said Johnson, who claimed nothing was more soothing than watching the miles click by at the rate of three a minute. "I love turning up the radio and putting my elbow up on the fire extinguisher while I just kind of watch the world hurtle by like I haven't got a care in the world." Johnson returned two hours later, having only stopped outside of Atlanta for 9.6 seconds to get gas.
