MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--Promising to transform the way people experience Meryl Streep, Google announced Monday its new "Streep View" technology, providing zoomable 360-degree panoramas of the Oscar-winning actress. "For the first time, Google users are not merely limited to marking Streep locations on a map, but can also see her from any angle or scale they wish," Google CEO Larry Page announced at a press event debuting the software platform, which is now live at streep.google.com. "Furthermore, our fleet of Streep View vans is working 24-7 to photograph every square centimeter of her surface and create a truly seamless Meryl-navigation experience." As part of the company's ongoing mission to streamline its suite of services, Page added that the module is fully compatible with the latest version of Google Firth.
