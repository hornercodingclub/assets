BALTIMORE--As the Orioles completed a six-game winning streak last Sunday, several O's fans expressed concern about the mental and physical health of every other Major League Baseball team. "For J.J. Hardy and Mark Reynolds to suddenly play so well, you know that means there has to be something seriously wrong with everyone else," Orioles fan Elaine Dietz told reporters, adding that the team's combined talent should never result in consecutive wins at any given time. "If the Orioles go on another streak like that, I would seriously consider ending the season immediately and testing every American League team for bacterial, viral, and autoimmune disorders. If whatever the league has contracted isn't caught immediately, it could mean the end of baseball." At press time, members of the Minnesota Twins, whom the Orioles swept in August, were experiencing fatigue, vomiting blood, and reporting painful skin pustules all over their bodies.
