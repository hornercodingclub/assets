U.S. commerce secretary John Bryson was involved in a hit-and-run in Los Angeles when his vehicle struck a car stopped at a train tracks. What do think? "To think Bryson came to office promising that no one would ever hear of him." Mike Williams * Tray Packer "This was a bad stunt to pull in an election year. Just hold off until November, and then you can kill as many people as you want." Rona Calvert * Systems Analyst "Oh, Jesus, the commerce secretary? I was planning on buying and selling goods like crazy this week. Am I totally fucked?" Will Sterling * Grating-Machine Operator
