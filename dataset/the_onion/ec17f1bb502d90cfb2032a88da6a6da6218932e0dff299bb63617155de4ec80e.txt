INDIANAPOLIS--Taking advantage of his team's recent road game against the Indianapolis Colts over the weekend, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning reportedly used the opportunity to visit with his wife and children, sources confirmed today. "I hadn't seen Ashley and the kids since I signed with Denver in the spring of 2012, so I figured I would stop by the old place and check in," said the 12-time Pro Bowler and former Colts play caller, adding that he managed to fit in a 15-minute stopover with his family at their Indianapolis-area home before heading to Lucas Oil Stadium on Sunday. "It seems like they're all doing pretty well, which is good. Marshall and Mosley really grew a lot. I guess they're getting older." Though Manning expressed regret at having to leave his family and return to Denver, the four-time MVP told reporters that he hopes to get the chance to visit them again should the Broncos come back to town for the AFC Championship game.
