PITTSBURGH--Steelers safety Troy Polamalu reportedly wreaked havoc on the Tri-State Orthopedics Clinic Monday, flailing around wildly on his crutches and violently knocking over unsuspecting physical therapy patients while rehabilitating the sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee. "The guy is nuts," physical therapist Josh Buckner said. "Troy goes at top speed on those crutches at all times and just throws his entire body into people. I've never seen someone try to recover from an injury with such reckless abandon." Although several staff members attempted to recommend resting, icing, and elevating the knee, Polamalu reportedly hopped away on one foot so he could disrupt a group of elderly patients working on flexibility exercises.
