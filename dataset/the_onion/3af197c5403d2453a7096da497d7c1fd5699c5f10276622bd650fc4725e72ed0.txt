LINCOLN, NE--Loudly demanding an immediate statement on the issue, Nebraska voters clamored this week for more information from female politician Elaine Romero, an Omaha businesswoman running in the state's upcoming gubernatorial primary election, on whether she is, in fact, a mother first. "Elaine Romero has made her stance on the social and economic issues facing Nebraskans abundantly clear, but we will not rest until she states clearly and on the record whether she is a mom first and foremost, and a politician second," local resident Martin McGlynn said on behalf of 1.9 million restless Nebraskans, all of whom were vehemently pressing for answers on whether the 45-year-old public servant prioritizes her family above all else, considers her three children to be her proudest accomplishment, and--most crucially--sees her role as a mother as her most important job. "Time and time again, Ms. Romero has spoken on the need for government accountability and transparency, yet voters still don't know whether she wakes up in the morning as a mother and not a candidate running for office, or if she works hard to balance politics and parenting. Why is she beating around the bush? Why won't she just come out and say whether her goal in seeking public office is to help create a better world for her children to grow up in?" Though vowing to continue holding Romero's feet to the fire on the subject, voters conceded they would be appeased if she admitted publicly that looking at her kids every day reminds her of what's truly important.
