WAUKEGAN, IL--After learning Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev had been hiding inside a boat parked in a Massachusetts man's backyard, 46-year-old Ethan Bryer told reporters Wednesday that he now makes sure to check the interior of his 30-foot bowrider every morning. "After what happened in Watertown, I'm not taking any chances," said Bryer, explaining that before leaving for work, he always carefully lifts the tarp of his boat with a baseball bat in hand. "These days, you never know who could be hiding in there. I check my boat before going to bed at night, too." At press time, Bryer was slowly approaching his boat.
