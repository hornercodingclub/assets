ALEXANDRIA, AL--Sources at Alexandria High School confirmed Thursday that football head coach Eric Grier, the man who just unleashed an abusive, profane tirade at 14-year-old freshman linebacker Brandon Baker, also serves as the school's special education teacher. "What the fuck was that? You're lollygagging out there like a fucking turd," said Grier, who during the school day is responsible for teaching and providing emotional support to kids with learning and developmental disorders. "No, shut the fuck up. That was fucking horrendous. You're wasting this team's time and you're wasting my goddamn time, so I better not fucking see you pulling any more of that soft-ass pansy bullshit." After practice ended, the 36-year-old coach reportedly drove home to have dinner with his wife and two young children.
