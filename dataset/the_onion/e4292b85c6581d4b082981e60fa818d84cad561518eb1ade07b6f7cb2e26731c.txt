MILWAUKEE--Calling it a huge opportunity to tap into a market that has traditionally been neglected by motorcycle manufacturers, Harley-Davidson announced Thursday a new line of motorcycles designed specifically for men. "Everything about our original line of motorcycles, including our elegant filigree logo, was created with women in mind, but it's 2017, and there's no reason not to have a bike for the guys as well," said CEO Matthew Levatich, adding that while men often admire the performance of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, they generally can't imagine actually owning something so frilly and feminine themselves. "We were hesitant because the name 'Harley-Davidson' is so synonymous with women that any rebrand seemed impossible, but when men get a look at this Harley--in black or silver, hot pink--they're going to want to get their hands on one, the same way the ladies have since we were founded in 1903." At press time, the new bikes were reportedly selling poorly, as many men found the idea of a Harley specifically aimed at them deeply patronizing.
