NEW YORK--In an effort to increase attendance and reward the league's fans, WNBA president Donna Orender announced Wednesday that the first 100 ticket holders to arrive at the conference semifinal games would be allowed to leave extra early. "The best way we can think of to thank our loyal fans is to make it easier for them to duck out anytime after tip-off," Orender told reporters. "The first 100 guests will receive a special golden pass that, when redeemed, will not only give them exclusive access to the VIP exits, but also a free rib dinner at any participating Damon's Grill restaurant." Orender also stressed that the promotion was not available to WNBA employees, family members, or players.
