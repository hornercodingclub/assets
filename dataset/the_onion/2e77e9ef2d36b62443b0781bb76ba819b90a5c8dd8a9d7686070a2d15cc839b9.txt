NEW YORK--Determining that not one of his recent food selections was entirely above suspicion, local man Kevin Curhan said Thursday that his food poisoning could realistically be pinned on any meal from the past week. "I had that leftover burrito for lunch yesterday, and that'd been sitting around in the fridge for a pretty long time, but then again, the milk I had that morning was also kinda off," said Curhan, adding that the food from the $4.99 Chinese buffet and the fried eggs he realized were undercooked but went ahead and ate anyway could also be responsible for the overpowering nausea he was currently experiencing. "Then there were those turkey cold cuts I had Tuesday that were a couple of days expired. Those have to be at least part of it, don't they? There's probably a few other things I'm not thinking of, too." At press time, Curhan was comfortable removing only a bowl of plain oatmeal consumed last Saturday from his list of possible culprits.
