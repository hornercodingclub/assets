To my universally celebrated works of drama, and , I would like to add my third and most ambitious effort to date, .  OSVALD, a young man. OSVALD'S MOTHER, Osvald's mother. PASTOR MANDERS, family friend. GHOST, ghost. P. THURMAN ZEEBULL, famed publisher and author of this play. HENRIK IBSEN, playwright.   PASTOR MANDERS: Your son Osvald has grown into a fine young man, Osvald's Mother. OSVALD'S MOTHER: Yet, Pastor Manders, I fear he shall be cut down in his very prime. He was infected with the clap during conception by Osvald's Father, a wayward sea-captain who is presumed lost at sea. The boy can go crackers any second. PASTOR MANDERS: My word!  OSVALD: I feel as right as rain.  GHOST: I am the ghost of your sea-captain father. I'm afraid I infected you with the clap during conception. Sorry.  OSVALD: Oh, damn. Now you tell me.  OSVALD'S MOTHER: Osvald! Osvald!!   P. THURMAN ZEEBULL: This play I wrote is very exciting.  HENRIK IBSEN: You American son of a bitch, you ripped off my play . P. THURMAN ZEEBULL: Quite so, and if anything, I improved it greatly. Yours was very boring. HENRIK IBSEN: Have at you, sir! I shall obtain satisfaction!  ZEEBULL: Huzzah! America is the greatest land of all!
