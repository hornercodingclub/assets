SAN DIEGO--Inviting guests to "bring a big appetite" with them the next time they visit, SeaWorld officials announced Tuesday that for a limited time the marine theme park's cafe will be offering a 5-Pound Orca Burger Challenge. "Stop in today and see if you have what it takes to polish off five freshly flame-broiled pounds of killer-whale meat served on a homemade bun with your choice of delicious toppings," said SeaWorld spokesperson Lisa Doyle, adding that participants will be given 45 minutes to eat the giant ground orca patty and a side of blubber-battered fries, both of which will be prepared from scratch on site. "Anyone who can finish this whale of a sandwich within the time limit will get their picture on our Wall of Fame and, while supplies last, a free 'I ate the big one at SeaWorld' T-shirt!" Doyle stated that those who do not partake in the orca-burger challenge would still be able to enjoy the restaurant's other new menu items, including baskets of curly dorsal fins and any cooked-to-order selection they pick from the choose-your-own-dolphin tank.
