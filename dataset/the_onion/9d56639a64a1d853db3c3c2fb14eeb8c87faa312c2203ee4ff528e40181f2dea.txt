ATLANTA--While controversy continues regarding Michael Vick's possible involvement in dogfights held at a Smithfield, GA property owned by the quarterback, NBC sportscaster Bob Costas has made his opinion of the events known, saying the dog-fighting in question was some of the best he had ever personally witnessed. "Truly high-caliber dog-fighting has nearly become extinct in this country, and it's becoming unusual to see the kind of devotion to the sport that was displayed at Vick's pit," Costas said Monday. "I mean, the pit he owned. He may not have actually been at the extremely riveting, thrill-a-minute canine fights to the death that it was my pleasure--no, my great privilege--to attend." Costas has often criticized the recent decline in quality of the illegal death sport, saying dog-fighting has become "shameless in its pandering to the worst echelon of sports fanhood" and "has sunk nearly as low as boxing."
