Police in a Wisconsin town asked a woman to leave a McDonald's because she had brought her therapy kangaroo, Jimmy, a support animal she says helps her deal with emotional stress, to the restaurant, leading to complaints from customers. What do think? "Nothing like taking care of a 200-pound wild animal with a six-foot vertical leap to calm the nerves." Michael Koepp * Events Coordinator "Well, we'd all like to take our kangaroos everywhere, but that's just not possible." Greg Hertford * Unemployed "I agree with the police on this one. That's a dangerously unsanitary situation for the kangaroo to be in." Laura Mishler * Parking Lot Attendant
