DENVER--Erasing any lingering doubts that he will continue his record-breaking career, the Denver Broncos confirmed Wednesday that star quarterback Peyton Manning has been cleared to play next season after passing a detailed and thorough verbal neck examination. "We were very pleased with Peyton's ability to answer all questions about the flexion, extension, and rotation of his neck muscles," said team physician Dr. Grant Kisele, adding that when testing whether Manning had full range of motion, the 37-year-old quickly passed the assessment with an emphatic "yup." "Peyton's neck is strong, stable, and shows no signs of damage or muscular atrophy from this past season, and his 2011 spinal fusion has had no ill effects on his arm strength--he said so very clearly." Team sources also confirmed that Manning is contractually obligated to pass a similar physical over the phone every year for the duration of his contract.
