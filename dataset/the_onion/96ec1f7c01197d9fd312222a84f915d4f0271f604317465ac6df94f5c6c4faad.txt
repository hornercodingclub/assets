NEW BRITAIN, CT--Explaining that the article did not meet the publication's high standards, the editors of , Central Connecticut State University's student newspaper, confirmed Wednesday that the inaccuracy of every single detail forced them to pull the issue's top story at the last minute. "We at strive to ensure that every piece of writing we publish contains timely and thoroughly reported information, and because each sentence of this article contains at least one factual error, we made the call to kill it," said editor-in-chief Hannah Lowry, noting numerous "red flags" in the article that included an incorrect date and location; misattributed quotes; several wide-of-the-mark figures, including the school's attendance; and the names of students, faculty, and buildings that do not exist. "While I was confident in the story's reporting after my first pass, a closer inspection earlier today revealed that the piece as a whole does not contain a single accurate statement, and the headline referred to a campus event that never occurred. It was with this knowledge that I made the decision to pull the story from publication, ensuring that we uphold the paramount responsibilities entrusted to us by the Blue Devil community." At press time, the student reporter who authored the article had reportedly apologized to the staff and attributed the errors to extreme fatigue.
