NEW YORK--Reflecting fondly on the television appearance that launched the K-pop group into superstardom, members of BTS told reporters Thursday that they were excited to be back in America for the first time since their 1963 performance on . "Nothing will compare to the thrill of hearing Mr. Sullivan introduce us as a 'few fine young men from South Korea' way back when, but it's still great to reconnect with fans in the States after nearly six decades," said band vocalist Jimin, who called the show's host "a true class act" for putting them on the bill of the November 3, 1963 episode headlined by Sid Caesar and ventriloquist Rickie Layne. "Obviously, you could barely hear us playing 'We On' over all the teenagers screaming, but even at the time, I knew this was going to change our lives forever." BTS members went on to describe their hopes that their fame had died down enough that they could enjoy exploring America this time without covering their faces with newspapers or hiding inside phone booths.
