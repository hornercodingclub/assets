LOS ANGELES--Moments after the Kings took turns hoisting the Stanley Cup in celebration of their championship victory Monday, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman gave the team instructions on caring for the trophy and distributed a six-page, stapled document listing everything it's allergic to. "First off: I know you guys are really excited, but no latex," Bettman told Kings captain Dustin Brown, puffing his cheeks and gesturing with his arms away from his sides to demonstrate how the trophy swells up. "And absolutely no gluten. Seriously, don't even breathe on the Cup if you've just eaten pasta, let alone kiss it. Damn thing will be covered in hives for days." Bettman also had every member of the squad practice injecting the Stanley Cup with its EpiPen, instructing the Kings to put the needle through the ring section listing the 1974 champion Philadelphia Flyers, which is already riddled in scar tissue anyway.
