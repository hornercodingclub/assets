WASHINGTON--Responding to a damning report alleging he had shared highly classified information with Russian officials, President Donald Trump addressed the concerns of the press, his fellow government officials, and the public at large Tuesday by announcing that he was an incredibly stupid human being. "I am a big idiot," said the president, adding that the reason he always messes everything up is that he is a dumb moron who doesn't know better. "I do a lot of things that don't make sense and are bad, and that's because I don't understand much. If I was smart, I would do stuff better, but I'm not. I'm really, really stupid." The commander in chief added that it was probably best if somebody stopped him from doing dumb things all the time because he was too stupid to know how.
