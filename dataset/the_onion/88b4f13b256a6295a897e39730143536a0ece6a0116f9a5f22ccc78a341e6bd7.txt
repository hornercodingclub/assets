--Following her recent string of high-profile relationships, including a romance earlier this week with cartoonist , singer-songwriter Taylor Swift is now dating Suri Cruise, sources confirmed today. "Taylor and Suri were seen grabbing lunch at a Thai restaurant in SoHo earlier this afternoon, and we can confirm that the two are now officially an item," TMZ reporter Allison Raeber wrote of the budding romance between the 23-year-old pop star and the 6-year-old daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, nicknaming the couple "Saylor."
