DANVILLE, KY--During his debate with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) Thursday night, Vice President Joe Biden reportedly paused midway through a remark on Medicare vouchers, abruptly turned away from the table, and then clenched his stomach, spewing a copious stream of vomit onto the stage. "Hurrrrck, hurrrck, huhhhgluahh!" retched the doubled-over Biden, who dazedly wiped his mouth and eyes with a leather sleeve before regaining his composure. "Phew! Sorry, folks, just needed to shoot that out of the system. Guess those pancakes didn't soak up the tequila as well as I thought. Feel great now, though." Biden assured debate moderator Martha Raddatz that the incident was unusual and that he hadn't "painted the floor like that in at least a month."
