WASHINGTON--Vehemently defending the Supreme Court nominee against recent allegations of sexual assault, GOP officials declared Wednesday that Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be held accountable for something he did as a white teenager. "We're talking about something that occurred when Mr. Kavanaugh was a mere 17-year-old Caucasian," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), adding that it was ridiculous to allow a single incident that happened when Kavanaugh was in an elite and mostly white high school ruin the career of such an accomplished white person. "I expect most of my colleagues here in the Senate remember what it's like to be a young white man and make mistakes. The important thing is that we learn from those mistakes and grow up to be responsible white adults. It's shameful that my Democratic colleagues feel the need to sully Judge Kavanaugh's reputation when they, too, surely understand that boys of European descent will be boys of European descent." McConnell went on to state that the assault would hardly even be noteworthy had the victim not been a 15-year-old white girl.
