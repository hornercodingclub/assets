CHICAGO--Calling the overall human experience "poignant," "thought-provoking," and a "complete tour de force," film critic Roger Ebert praised existence Thursday as "an audacious and thrilling triumph." "While not without its flaws, life, from birth to death, is a masterwork, and an uplifting journey that both touches the heart and challenges the mind," said Ebert, adding that while the totality of all humankind is sometimes "a mess in places," it strives to be a magnum opus and, according to Ebert, largely succeeds at this goal. "At times brutally sad, yet surprisingly funny, and always completely honest, I wholeheartedly recommend existence. If you haven't experienced it yet, then what are you waiting for? It is not to be missed." Ebert later said that while human existence's running time was "a little on the long side," it could have gone on much, much longer and he would have been perfectly happy.
