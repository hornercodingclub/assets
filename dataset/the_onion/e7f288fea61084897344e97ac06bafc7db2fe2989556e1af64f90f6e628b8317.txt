LONDON--Exposing widespread cases of rampant neglect and overly harsh treatment, human rights organization Amnesty International released a damning report Friday decrying the cruel and inhumane conditions of NHL penalty boxes. "Confining players against their will in these filthy and incredibly cramped enclosures is absolutely unacceptable in today's modern game," read an excerpt from the report, which also demanded accountability from the NHL after penalized players as young as 18 were found to be subjected to relentless abuse by opposing fans in arenas across the league. "The floors are often covered with the spit and refuse of previous offenders, with two players sometimes forced to share the same putrid, unhygienic penalty box. This brutal punishment is handed out for even the smallest of infractions--in some cases a five-minute sentence for a bullshit cross-checking call--and the NHL has simply turned a blind eye to this incredibly serious issue." The report went on to heavily criticize the league's barbaric policy of forcing a penalized player to watch as his teammates are reduced to playing short-handed.
