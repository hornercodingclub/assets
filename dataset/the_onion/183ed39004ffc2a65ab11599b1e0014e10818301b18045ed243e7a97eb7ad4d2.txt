DETROIT--Citing the Steelers' overwhelming defense and remarkable team resilience, as well as the overpowering Seahawks ground game and odds-defying tenacity, football analysts around the nation say Super Bowl XL is shaping up to be one of the most evenly matched blowouts in the history of the NFL Championship Game. "Ignore the hype about overdogs and underdogs--these are two very good teams, and we won't know which team will absolutely crush the other until halfway through the first quarter," said 's Peter King. "Sunday's Super Bowl might be the most well-balanced one-sided game since the great Montana-Elway matchups." The betting lines as of press time still had Pittsburgh as a two-point favorite, though with an over/under of 34.
