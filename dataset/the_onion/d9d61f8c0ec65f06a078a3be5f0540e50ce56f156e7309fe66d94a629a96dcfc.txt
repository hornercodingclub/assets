WASHINGTON--Mortified that the recordings had ever been part of its collection, embarrassed officials at the Library of Congress expressed disbelief on Monday at some of the albums the 217-year-old cultural institution used to be into. "Oh my God--the Harvard Glee Club, the Eagles, Al Jolson--what the hell were we thinking?" said Librarian of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden, cringing at a box of Jimmie Rodgers' 1930s yodeling records that "probably seemed a lot cooler at the time." "Don't get me wrong; Ella Fitzgerald, Neil Armstrong's recorded words from the moon, the Velvet Underground--all that's still good, but boy, some of this just does not hold up. I think I've listened to the Frank Zappa stuff and Calvin Coolidge's inauguration maybe twice." Sources later confirmed seeing trucks unloading several thousand boxes outside a nearby used record store.
