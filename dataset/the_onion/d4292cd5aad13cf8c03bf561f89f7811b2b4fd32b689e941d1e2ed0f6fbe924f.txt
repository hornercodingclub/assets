LONDON--Excited members of the British royal family released an ultrasound image Tuesday morning showing the unborn child of the former Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, whose pregnancy was yesterday. "We are so thrilled to release this image of our future monarch, whose prophesied moment of ascension we await anxiously," proud great-grandmother-to-be Queen Elizabeth II told reporters. "Soon it shall be with us. Soon all will be as foretold." Representatives for the royal family claimed the child's mother was "unable" to be interviewed, as she "needs much rest--the vessel requires strength."
