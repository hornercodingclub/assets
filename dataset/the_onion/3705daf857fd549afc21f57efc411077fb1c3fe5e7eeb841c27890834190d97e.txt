An ad for Popchips featuring Ashton Kutcher speaking in a stereotypical Indian accent and wearing brown-face makeup was pulled after a public outcry. What do think? "I, for one, am glad Popchips decided to go with an American actor instead of outsourcing the job to an actual Indian." Warren Tracy * Systems Analyst "None of this would have happened if society had more ardently opposed Ashton Kutcher's career in the first place." Tara Hall * Geodesist "Why was it racist? Did they not make him brown enough?" Lou Zellner * Reject Opener
