CHICAGO--Following several inquiries about how you were adjusting to the new place, your mother reportedly wanted to know Monday if the people who live in your apartment building are nice. "So, are the other people that live there nice?" asked your mother, referring to the 134 other tenants currently residing in your eight-story apartment building who you have not spoken a single word to once, even in passing. "You should invite them over sometime. Maybe they could help you put together that new shelf you bought." At press time, your mother was suggesting that you and the residents of the building's 91 other units get together this weekend to watch one of those TV shows you like.
