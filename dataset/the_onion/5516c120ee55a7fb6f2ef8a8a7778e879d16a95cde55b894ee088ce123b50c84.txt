INDIANAPOLIS--Following the UConn women's 72-63 loss to Notre Dame in the NCAA Final Four last Sunday, the Huskies expressed shock over how they could have lost to a women's basketball team. "I don't see how we can still call ourselves an elite college basketball program if we're going to get beaten by a bunch of girls,"  UConn star Maya Moore said of the defeat. "Nothing against the Irish--they're really good for a ladies' squad--but I had hoped to end my career with a little more dignity." UConn guard Tiffany Hayes agreed with Moore, but said she would console herself with the fact that the UConn men's team probably would have lost to Notre Dame as well.
