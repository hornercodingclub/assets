CLARKSBURG, WV--Video-streaming service Netflix reportedly checked in on local customer Shane Fowler late Tuesday after a marathon viewing session in which the 31-year-old watched the entire third season of the TV series in one sitting. "Hey, bud, just wanted to make sure everything's all right over there. You doing okay?" read an e-mail Fowler received after he finished watching more than a dozen consecutive 45-minute episodes of the FX motorcycle gang drama. "We noticed you've kind of been burning through a lot of shows lately, and we just thought we'd check to see if everything's all right at work and at home and what not. As long as you're good, we'll get out of your hair, but if there's ever anything you need, let us know, okay? Cool." Sources confirmed Netflix's top 10 list of suggestions for Fowler currently includes going outside for a bit of fresh air, meeting new people, and checking out all 13 episodes of the website's critically acclaimed new political series .
