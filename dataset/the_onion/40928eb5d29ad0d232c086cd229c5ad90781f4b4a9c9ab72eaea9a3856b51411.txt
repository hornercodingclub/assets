COLLEGE PARK, MD--Saying the money would help further researchers' understanding of the awesome scientific phenomenon, representatives for the American Institute of Physics announced Tuesday that they had received a $10 million grant to melt stuff. "This funding will provide our researchers with the resources they need to put some junk over a really hot flame until it starts liquefying and gets all stretched out and stuff," said AIP director James Griffith, adding that a portion of the grant would be allocated to making sure the flames were "real big" so that the research team could melt large items, such as desk chairs and lamps. "We already have a number of experiments lined up that will answer such questions as whether laboratory goggles or a digital thermometer melts first, and we've scheduled several trials to determine how fast we can melt a whole cafeteria tray. Pending our findings, my colleagues and I will then wait to see if all the melted stuff hardens up, at which point we intend to hold it over the flame and melt it again." This research follows a $6 million study last year in which scientists were reportedly able to determine that dropping an electron microscope into a huge vat of acid is really fun.
