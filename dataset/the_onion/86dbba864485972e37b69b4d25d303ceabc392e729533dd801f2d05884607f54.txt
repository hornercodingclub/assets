CLEVELAND--Following the Wildcats' 78-39 victory over West Virginia in the Sweet 16, Kentucky sources confirmed that coach John Calipari had canceled Friday's practice so the players could get fitted for NBA draft suits. "Coach told us it was really important to be prepared, because draft night is just around the corner and we all need to get measured for suits," said freshman center Karl-Anthony Towns, adding that Calipari had insisted that it was far more convenient for the tailor to see Kentucky's starting five at the same appointment. "It'll be June before we know it, and coach reminded everybody that a bunch of offensive and defensive drills won't do anything to help us look our best when we're on the stage representing our new NBA teams." At press time, Calipari encouraged Kentucky players to leave their schedules open early next week in order to start meeting with agents to discuss potential endorsement deals.
