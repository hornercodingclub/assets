RALEIGH, NC--Determining the time had come to seek out livelier company, local man Thomas Weber reportedly surveyed the party he was attending Thursday for the next group he could silently stand in. "Let's see, which of these clusters of people do I want to linger in for the next half hour or so without saying a single word?" thought Weber, who sources said had grown bored with the stale conversation of the partygoers he was mutely hovering around. "Those people over by the refrigerator seem interesting. Maybe I'll wander over to grab a beer and then just sort of loiter around the periphery smiling and nodding my head every so often." At press time, no one in attendance had realized Weber left the party without saying goodbye to anyone.
