PHOENIX--With a cushy four-game lead in their division following their 26-20 win over the Seahawks last week, the Arizona Cardinals head into week 12 of the regular season in a crucial wouldn't-hurt-to-win-but-don't-really-have-to situation. "As Arizona Cardinals, there is nothing we prepare for more than these at-first-glance-big-but-truly-unimportant-in-the-greater-scheme-of-things games," head coach Ken Whisenhunt said in a press conference earlier this week. "We need to get out there, play physical, and execute, though if we don't it probably won't be the worst thing in the world. I can already see one or two games after this one that are more important, and that's not even counting the playoffs, which we're pretty much guaranteed to make at this point." Whisenhunt added that playing in the worst division in football makes it hard to estimate his team's chances against the Giants but "certainly has its compensations."
