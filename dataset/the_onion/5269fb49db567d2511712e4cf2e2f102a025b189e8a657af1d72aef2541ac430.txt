DURAND, MN--Guests in the home of local couple Steve and Pamela Baker were taken aback Sunday after being confronted with the sight of the large mirror mounted on the libertine kink-lovers' bathroom wall. "I suspected those two were adventurous, but wow, I did not expect they'd rig a mirror for watching themselves doing God knows what right there in front of the sink," said friend Rae Tanner, who also engaged in nervous speculation that the mirror may constitute a subtle invitation to join in on her hosts' ablution-related sexual depravity. "It wouldn't even be any of my business, but it's a little irresponsible for swingers to put their big mirror right out in the open like this. What if a child came in here?" At press time, a horrified Tanner was trying to wash up and leave as fast as possible to avoid looking at her hosts' electric toothbrush.
