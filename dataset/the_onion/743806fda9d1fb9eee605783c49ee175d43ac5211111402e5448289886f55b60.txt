SAN FRANCISCO--Coming off his second straight win as 49ers quarterback, Colin Kaepernick admitted to reporters Thursday that watching Alex Smith over the past two years has not helped his game in the slightest. "I wish I could say Alex has been an inspiration to me and all that, but I've watched the guy play 27 games now, and honest to God, I didn't get a single thing out of it," said Kaepernick, who added that seeing the 8-year veteran in practice and in games has taught him nothing about staying cool in the pocket, reading defenses, improvising when protection breaks down, or leadership either on or off the field. "I guess the only thing I did learn was how to completely fall apart during a conference championship game. That and how to rely on a great running back and phenomenal defense to win games for you. Otherwise, it was pretty much useless." Kaepernick confirmed that his greatest learning experience since entering the league came while watching Eli Manning play against the 49ers.
