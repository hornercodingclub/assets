WASHINGTON--Declaring that the president had been warned about naming a justice during an election year, a defiant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly held up the severed head of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland this afternoon while standing in front of the Capitol building. "We vowed that no nominees would be considered," said McConnell, his suit reportedly splattered with blood as he flung the centrist appeals court judge's bespectacled head aside and kicked it down the Capitol steps. "There shall be no hearing. Do not attempt to silence the voice of the American people." Sources also confirmed that McConnell later wrapped Garland's severed right hand in his judicial robes and mailed the package to potential nominee Sri Srinivasan.
