NABLUS, GAZA STRIP (AP)--Israeli troops patrolling the border of the Gaza Strip breathed a sigh of relief Monday as state-of-the-art Israeli customs-searching equipment intercepted a large shipment of rocks bound for Palestinian youth demonstrators. It is believed that the shipment came from a rogue Soviet republic willing to sell rocks to the highest bidder on the international arms market. The value of the shipment--250 crates filled with rocks, pebbles and gravel--is estimated in the neighborhood of 800 million dinar (about $6). The rocks, mostly small, one-hand throwing rocks, were concealed in large crates of medical supplies being sent to PLO camps near the Israel-Jordan border. Israeli officials vowed to track down the supplier of the weapons. "Whatever secret underground rock smugglers have been outfitting the Palestinians, we will find them," Israeli Defense Minister Avi Birkot said. "Rocks like these could really hurt someone." According to munitions expert James Wolk, if thrown with enough force and accuracy, the seized rocks "could create permanent scuff marks in an Israeli tank, and possibly even make a small dent." "The world is still a very dangerous place," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in an offical U.S. statement.
