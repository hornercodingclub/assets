HOWARD, MD--Shaking his head and sighing as he viewed the televised proceedings, Merrick Garland reportedly grumbled "Could've been me" while watching Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch's Senate hearing Monday at a local bar with his fellow highway maintenance workers. "I'm supposed to be sitting up there before the Judiciary Committee, you know," said a visibly frustrated Garland, taking a swig of beer and complaining to the members of his road crew that if he hadn't gotten "royally screwed" he would be on CSPAN-2 testifying right now. "It's all a bunch of political bullshit. Don't get me wrong, I like working with you guys out there, but I had that nomination dead to rights, and they snatched it away from me. Well, guess it's time to get back to work--those dotted white lines aren't gonna paint themselves." At press time, Garland was scooping out debris blocking a drainage basin on an I-695 median.
