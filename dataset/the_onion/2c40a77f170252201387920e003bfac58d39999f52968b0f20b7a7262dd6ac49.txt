SANTA CLARA, CA--Admitting to being "worried sick" after realizing he had suddenly disappeared in the middle of a play, family and friends of Peyton Manning grew incredibly concerned Sunday after the veteran Denver Broncos quarterback wandered away from the pocket during the first quarter of Super Bowl 50, sources confirmed. "I looked downfield for a few seconds, and when I looked back, he was gone--we all just started panicking and trying to figure out what happened," said Cooper Manning, adding that his brother was soon spotted roaming aimlessly near the sideline. "We always tell him, 'Peyton, you have to stay inside the pocket so we know you're safe,' but sometimes he just forgets where he is. Thank God he's okay, but my heart was in my mouth for a few minutes there. He has to be more aware of his surroundings, because next time we might not be so lucky." At press time, an alert had been issued through the stadium PA system after Manning wandered into the stands and vanished in a dense crowd of fans.
