WASHINGTON--While preparing to leave for work Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder reportedly loaded up his iPod with dozens of Associated Press reporters' confidential phone conversations to enjoy on his morning commute. "It usually takes me about 30 minutes to get to the office, so I'll have something to listen to to pass the time," said the Justice Department head while transferring the wiretap recordings taken from dozens of AP journalists' work and cell phone lines from his home computer to his mp3 player. "It's nice to just sit back and listen to a few secret conversations between reporters and their classified sources. Lately I've been getting into [AP Middle East correspondent] Bassem Mroue's stuff. His off-the-record calls with top intelligence officials are awesome. It's like he's just having a conversation with these people and I'm lucky enough to listen in." Holder added that he's saving a really lengthy call between executive editor Martin Baron and CIA Director John Brennan for a cross-country flight he's taking Friday.
