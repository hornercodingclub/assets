NEW YORK--Weeks after their 2008 swimsuit issue hit newsstands, continues to be deluged with mail from appreciative women across America thanking the magazine for once again helping them choose attractive, functional beachwear. "It's never too early in the spring to get your wardrobe ready for summer!" Cleveland, OH housewife Erica Robbins, 46, wrote in a letter the magazine received Monday. "I've already made an appointment with a local artist to airbrush a dramatically high-cut crimson 'tankini' on my naked body the first day the thermometer goes over 75!"
