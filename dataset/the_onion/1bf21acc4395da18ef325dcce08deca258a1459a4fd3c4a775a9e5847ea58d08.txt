DECATUR, GA--Announcing a special offer aimed at "whetting appetites like never before," the Applebee's restaurant chain said Wednesday that for a limited time customers will be able to purchase 50 appetizers at the discounted price of $250. "Try 12 servings of our tempting Boneless Wings, followed by 20 plates of Chicken Quesadillas Grande, and polish it off with 18 baskets of our Crunchy Onion Rings--all for just $250 plus tax and tip," Applebee's representative Gavin Feig said in a press release, noting that the special allows customers to pay substantially less than they would if they were to buy 50 appetizers individually. "Best of all, the deal is valid with the purchase of any entree on our menu, including our longest-running favorite, the 25-Steak Dinner Deal." Feig added that the offer does not apply to orders of Chili Cheese Nachos, saying, "It's just the rule."
