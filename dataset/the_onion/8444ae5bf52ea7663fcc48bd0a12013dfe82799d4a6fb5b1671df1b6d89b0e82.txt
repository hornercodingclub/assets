ST. LOUIS--A recent hockey game between the St. Louis Blues and Vancouver Canucks went into extra-puck-time or something, ESPN reported Monday, after the two teams completed the real part of the contest yet continued to skate around for some time after that. "Usually they just do the beginning part, the middle part, and the end part, but this one was different--perhaps it had something to do with that man getting thrown into that icebox thing after he stepped over the blue line into the out-of-bounds zone or whatever," said Barry Melrose on ESPN's . "Hard to say, really. However, this game exceeded the length of a regular hockey game by a certain length of time, possibly even several minutes. That's what makes this sport great." Melrose noted that if the score had remained tied for much longer, the game would have been settled with one of those slapshot contests or goal-offs or some other such hockey-related deal.
