SEDALIA, MO--Following yesterday's speech by the president addressing the recent events in Roseburg, OR, local 42-year-old Tim Moss expressed his outrage to reporters that President Obama was attempting to capitalize off a tragedy to push his anti-tragedy agenda. "It's just disgusting and shameful that, once again, the first thing out of Obama's mouth after a tragedy is that he wants to limit tragedies," said Moss, adding that it is both insensitive and opportunistic of the president to suddenly shift the conversation toward curbing the number of tragedies as the nation mourns in the wake of this tragedy. "Every single time this happens, he makes the tragedy all about clamping down on tragedies, and it's simply not the time or the place for him to be going in front of the camera and pushing for steps to decrease the number of tragedies. Christ, this is a national tragedy we're dealing with right now." Moss added that he hopes Obama conducts himself more appropriately during the next tragedy.
