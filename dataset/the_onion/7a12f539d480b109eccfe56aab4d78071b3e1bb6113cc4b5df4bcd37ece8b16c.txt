DETROIT--Though their differing ages, nationalities, and backgrounds would suggest a greater divergence of opinions on the world of athletics, most Detroit Tigers players say baseball is their favorite sport, clubhouse sources reported Saturday. "We're all into sports around here, but I would say we talk more about baseball than anything else," said Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander, adding that he and his teammates follow baseball "pretty closely." "I liked a lot of different stuff when I was younger, but since leaving college and starting a busy career, I've found I'm paying more attention to baseball than other sports." Though many of the team's players are high-powered millionaires, sources said most decorate their lockers with simple bats, balls, and other types of baseball souvenirs, and wear baseball paraphernalia while they are working.
