LUBBOCK, TX--According to a report published Friday by the Texas Tech School of Health, Exercise, and Sports Science, every variation of running, from light jogs to full-out sprints, will factor heavily into the execution and outcomes of this week's sports. "Our studies show that running in some variety or another will be required for nearly every athlete--both amateur and professional," said Dr. Henry Chalmers, a lead researcher on the 14-month-long study. "Upper body strength, hand-eye coordination, and balance were a few of the other central factors we identified as important, but time after time we found that swift terrestrial locomotion will be prominent." The study also revealed that, unfortunately, kicking was also a contributing factor in several sports, but researchers noted that those required running immediately before or after every kick.
