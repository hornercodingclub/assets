HOUSTON--Attracting the attention of adjacent motorists and nearby pedestrians who turned their heads to see where the booming noise was coming from, a 2006 Ford Focus is said to have rolled up to a local stoplight Friday blaring Google Maps directions. "Head northeast on Crawford Street toward Commerce Street," an automated voice reverberating from the car's sound system reportedly stated, causing the vehicle's windows to rattle as the driver nodded along with the thunderous instructions to drive half a mile and keep right at the fork. "Follow signs for U.S. 59 North. Use the middle lane to merge onto I-69/U.S. 59 North." At press time, onlookers reported hearing a deafening chorus of "make a U-turn" after the car appeared to drive down an unmarked side street.
