MILWAUKEE--Having been recently reinstated after completing a 65-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball's drug policy, Milwaukee Brewers right fielder Ryan Braun told reporters Thursday he is desperate to win back the trust of baseball fans before he starts cheating again. "First and foremost, I have to rebuild my reputation before I even consider going back to using banned substances," said the former National League MVP, adding that prior to resuming his use of performance-enhancing drugs, he is intent on proving to millions of fans that he is a clean, honest athlete. "I've made some pretty shameful mistakes in the past, but I look at this season as a fresh start and an opportunity to truly earn the support of the great fans in Milwaukee. Then I'll make them look like total fucking idiots when I get caught using PEDs again and am kicked out of baseball for the rest of my life." Braun later admitted to reporters that he will continue his mission to rebuild the trust of baseball fans until midway through the season, at which point he will start using steroids again no matter what.
