When a group of fourth-graders in New Hampshire proposed a bill in the state legislature to establish the red-tailed hawk as the New Hampshire state raptor, lawmakers shut the measure down, arguing, "It grasps [its prey] with its talons then uses its razor sharp beak to basically tear it apart limb by limb," among other objections. What do think? "And that's why you don't push your bill until you know you have the votes." Sebastian Parnell * Systems Analyst "Sounds like the fourth-graders at Lincoln H. Akerman School just wasted a lot of political capital." Tim McMullen * Thermometer Reader "We'll take that hawk for Connecticut." Gabby Medina * Quill Stripper
