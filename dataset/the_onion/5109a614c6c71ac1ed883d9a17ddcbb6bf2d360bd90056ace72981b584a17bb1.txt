NEW YORK--In a special ceremony Thursday before his final game in New York, the Yankees officially unveiled an exquisite cage for Derek Jeter in Monument Park as a tribute to the team's beloved longtime shortstop. "Derek was such a pivotal part of our ball club's recent success, and this wonderful, permanent display is a fantastic way to honor his career and legacy," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of the new exhibit, which features a mounted bronze plaque listing Jeter's career highlights and accolades directly below the locked 5-by-7-foot stainless steel enclosure where the future Hall of Famer will be confined 24 hours a day. "Even if they never saw him play in person, Yankees fans from around the world now will have the chance to visit Monument Park and truly appreciate one of the greatest-ever players to wear the pinstripes. Alongside monuments to fellow legends like Ruth, Mantle, and DiMaggio, Derek's honorary cage is right where it belongs." Girardi went on to confirm that the Jeter cage will be open to the public before every home game, and that visitors are more than welcome to take pictures in front of the exhibit.
