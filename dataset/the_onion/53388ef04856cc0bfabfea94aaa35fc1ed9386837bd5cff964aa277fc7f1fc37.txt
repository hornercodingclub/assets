HOUSTON--Saying the team has benefited from a number of crucial offseason pickups, members of the Houston Texans expressed confidence to reporters Monday that they now have the right pieces in place to make a deep preseason run. "We've had our struggles before, but now that we've filled out the roster a bit, I think we have what it takes to go all the way in the preseason," said Texans running back Arian Foster, pointing to such recent squad additions as starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and safety Kendrick Lewis, both of whom Foster insisted would help the Texans "do some serious damage" during games in August. "We might have our share of doubters, but everyone here is tuning that stuff out and focusing on one thing: winning in the preseason. Honestly, if we can get hot and live up to our potential, I wouldn't be surprised if we went 4-0 this year." Foster went on to boldly claim that the Texans will be especially dangerous late in preseason games, when opposing teams are primarily fielding second and third stringers.
