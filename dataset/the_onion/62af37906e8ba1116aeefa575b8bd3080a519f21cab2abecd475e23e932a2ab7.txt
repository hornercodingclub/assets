CLAREMONT, CA--Visibly excited for the thrilling hour ahead, college sophomore Megan Anderson enthusiastically made her way to a meeting with members of her university's Office of Student Conflict Resolution to offer a detailed account of her recent sexual assault, the eager undergraduate told reporters Tuesday. "I get to go into a room filled with a committee of middle-aged men whose primary concern is upholding the college's reputation and recount in explicit detail the circumstances of my rape at the hands of another student--I can't wait," said the pleased 19-year-old, who noted that she's particularly looking forward to describing her choice of clothing the night of the assault, explaining the nature of her relationship with her rapist, and entertaining a variety of questions aimed at determining whether she herself invited the attack with her words and actions, all while offering a step-by-step account of the most horrific night of her life. "Don't get me wrong, it was great being interrogated by the local and campus police, but this way I get to tell university officials who have a vested interest in minimizing campus rape statistics and ensuring the steady inflow of alumni donations what exactly I was drinking and why I could have misremembered events. And to think, once I finally give my entire story, I then get the pleasure of listening as they try to push the whole incident under the rug. Lucky me!" Anderson added that though she didn't want to get her hopes up, she was secretly thrilled at the idea of continually seeing her rapist go about his regular life on campus for her remaining two years in college.
