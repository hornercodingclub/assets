CHARLOTTE, NC--Rookie quarterback Cam Newton delivered a statement Tuesday announcing his plans to move on from the Carolina Panthers so he can start his own independent professional football team. "I want to thank the Panthers for giving me the opportunity to play for them, but I would be denying myself the chance to reach my full potential if I stayed here," said Newton, adding that he will be using a lot of what he learned over the past six weeks as he gets his franchise started. "I've hit my peak with this organization. This is something I need to do." According to Newton, he has contacted wide receiver Steve Smith to play for him and head coach Ron Rivera to help design his new team's website.
