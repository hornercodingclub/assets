AUSTIN, TX--While attending the fourth day of this year's SXSW conference, Chicago-based marketing associate Tim Danner told reporters today that the music, film, and interactive festival is just about as cool, as alternative, and as real as it gets. "The great thing about South By is that practically everyone here is talking about the newest cutting-edge ideas, but the whole scene still has this super-chill underground vibe," said the 33-year-old who went to business school, makes a six-figure salary, and develops marketing strategies for a living. "What I like most of all is that it's not in New York or Los Angeles, but in Austin, which is like this cool little artsy town. That's so awesome and so authentic, you know? And there are so many great indie rock bands playing here, too. I love indie rock music." At press time, Danner was attending his 15th straight panel on the future of digital.
