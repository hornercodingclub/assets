NEW YORK--Following their first practice since their disastrous 38-0 loss to the Panthers, several Giants players reportedly expressed concern Monday that they are actually all on the same page. "Unfortunately, I think we're communicating well, have great team chemistry, and have  generally gelled to form one cohesive unit," said defensive end Justin Tuck, fearing that at this point the product on the field is the result of the team working in complete unison to the best of their abilities. "I hate to say it, but there's no confusion, zero distractions, and every player is committed to the same goal. It seems like everybody knows exactly what their individual roles are and how all the pieces are supposed to fit together. It's scary, but we may very well be the full sum of our parts." Tuck added that he is extremely worried that every single one of his teammates responded to his demand last week that they step up their game.
