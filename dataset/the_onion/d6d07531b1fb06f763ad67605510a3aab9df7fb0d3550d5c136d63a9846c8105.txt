MORTON, MN--Marveling at the increases in both quality and satisfaction that have come with decades of experience, local 51-year-old Doug Kearns told reporters Tuesday that he has lately been having the best snacks of his life. "I try to slow down and really savor snacks these days," said Kearns, attributing his growing fulfillment to the maturity that comes from a lifetime of having snacks. "Sure, I'm not having snacks as much as I did back in my twenties, but I'm much more comfortable mixing things up now. I've been open to being more experimental, and that has led to my enjoyment of some unbelievably hot snacks. And I've been having snacks all over the place: the kitchen, in the car--heck, last week I even had snacks in the tub. It's been incredible." Kearns added that, though he no longer rushes his way through snacks like he did in his youth, he does still tend to fall asleep immediately afterward.
