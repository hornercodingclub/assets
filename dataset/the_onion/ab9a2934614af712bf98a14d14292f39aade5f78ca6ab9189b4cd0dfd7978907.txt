COLUMBIA, SC--Advising the 1,500 new graduates to "check out this shit," Vice President Joe Biden reportedly lost control of his rapidly twirling butterfly knife Saturday while delivering the commencement speech at the University of South Carolina. "Son of a bitch," said Biden as the butterfly knife slipped from his grip, pinwheeled across the stage, and slid beneath the provost's seat. "Sorry, everybody. That never happens. Man, I had it going awesome earlier, but I'm sweatin' balls up here. Damn, that fucker's sharp as hell." Biden, who sources confirmed appeared to be slurping blood from a small wound on his hand, continued the commencement address by heavily quoting from the Whitesnake song "Slide It In."
