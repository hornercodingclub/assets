SAN FRANCISCO--With its shameless self-promotion, gratuitous content recycling, and completely disorienting design, aggregator website is utterly humiliating itself, sources confirmed Friday. "Looking for a laugh? Check out this gallery of our most popular posts from 2012!" reads a slideshow published on FlavorMix today, just one of dozens of search-engine-optimized entries that clutter the website's overwhelmingly tacky home page. "Did we forget to include favorite? Sound off in the comments! And before you go, check out some of these great stories from our content partners!" At press time, in a desperate effort to draw traffic, FlavorMix was reportedly attempting to entertain its users with a series of fun, colorful ads featuring looping audio that plays automatically and cannot be turned off.
