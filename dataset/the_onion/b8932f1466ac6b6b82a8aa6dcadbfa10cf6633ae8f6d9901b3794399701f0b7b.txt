POUGHKEEPSIE, NY--Resigning himself to his lukewarm fate, local man Marshall Bregman was at last coming to terms with the fact that his shower was not getting any hotter, sources said Friday. "I didn't want to believe it, but it's clear to me now that this shower is as hot as it will ever get," said Bregman, adding that it was pointless to even wonder why, as he was powerless to effect any change. "I tried everything, from turning the knob all the way to giving it a good 10 minutes to get nice and steamy, but it's not meant to be. You can only feel under the faucet for a rise in temperature for so long before you have no choice but to fully accept the situation. If nothing else, there's a kind of peace that comes with acceptance." At press time, Bregman was giving the shower just one more minute to heat up.
