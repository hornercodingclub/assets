HOBBS, NM--According to friends of the man, area cool basketball fan Kip Conroy calls the sport "b-ball," even though that is not the sport's official name. "Kip's always like, 'Want to play some b-ball?' or 'Did you see that b-ball game last night?' It's so cool," said coworker Aaron Beebe, who admitted Monday he once called basketball "hoops" but would never attempt anything as cool as saying "b-ball." "I think he must know a lot about basketball. That's why he feels so comfortable abbreviating it." When reached for comment, Conroy confirmed that "b-ball" is his favorite sport and that his favorite b-ball team is "all of them."
