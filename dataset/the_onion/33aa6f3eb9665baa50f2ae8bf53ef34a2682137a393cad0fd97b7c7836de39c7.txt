WASHINGTON-- Stating that he would be sticking to his guns regardless of the consequences, President Trump warned China in a White House press briefing Thursday that its leaders should not underestimate his willingness to sacrifice the well-being of every single person in the United States. "If you think for one second I'm about to back down on this trade war, you've clearly failed to grasp my complete indifference toward the entire population of my country," said the president, who affirmed his unwavering commitment to letting the price of consumer goods rise, even if it meant a certain number of American families might struggle to make ends meet or be forced to go hungry. "I'm not about to lose a fight just because we have a bunch of farmers who depend on Chinese markets and workers who will lose their jobs if factories can't get Chinese raw materials. Believe me, I can tolerate a tremendous amount of their pain." Trump went on to state that most Americans are "great patriots" and willing to suffer so that he can get anything wants.
