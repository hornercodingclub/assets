BARCELONA, SPAIN--In a show of solidarity following the terrorist attack that left 14 dead and over 100 injured in Barcelona, Spain, European leaders stood together Friday to say loud and clear that they were scared as fuck and didn't know what to do. "Side by side in the face of unfathomable violence, we assemble here today to say that we are united in our shared fear and our terrifying realization that we have no idea how to stop this," said German chancellor Angela Merkel, who, flanked on both sides by other European heads of state, affirmed that terrorism freaked them the fuck out and would be eradicated from the face of the earth if they only knew how. "Today, we are not German, we are not Italian or French--we are simply people who are frightened out of their goddamn minds. And though we might not share the same tongue, utter panic sounds the same in every language." At press time, European leaders vowed to continue hyperventilating as one.
