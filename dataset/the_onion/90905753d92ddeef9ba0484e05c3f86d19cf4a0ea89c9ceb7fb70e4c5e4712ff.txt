BOSTON--Several sources confirmed Friday that a man who is paid millions of dollars to play a game was reportedly called gutsy and lauded for a "valiant effort" to hit a small white ball with a wooden stick. "With such a plucky performance, he's showing some real courage at the plate," said the game's commentator, noting the spirited determination and daring of the man who sits for hours at a time during the competition. "It's nice in this day and age to see a player who is so lionhearted. He's just completely fearless when he's behind in the count." At press time, the person who makes a living by talking about the game was describing a ball being caught in a leather mitten as absolutely beautiful.
