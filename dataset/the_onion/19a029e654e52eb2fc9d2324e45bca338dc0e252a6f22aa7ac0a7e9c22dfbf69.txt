WASHINGTON--Following the Supreme Court's decision to uphold crucial portions of the Affordable Care Act, citizens across the country reportedly took a brief break Thursday from waiting on hold with their insurance providers to celebrate. "This is a great day," said Chicago resident David Snyder, one of millions of Americans who paused for a moment while trying to determine if their preferred doctor was in-network, checking on the status of an outstanding claim, or fighting a dubious charge that had appeared on their latest billing statement in order to revel in the court's landmark ruling. "I can't even say how big a relief it is that--hello? Hello? Dammit, they fucking hung up on me!" At press time, approximately 500,000 Americans were reportedly praising Chief Justice John Roberts for issuing the majority opinion while making a third attempt to navigate their health insurance company's automated phone tree.
