NEW YORK--Baseball experts agreed Thursday that the 2011 MLB season has become a year defined by pitching, hitting, and defense. "When people look back on this season, what is really going to stand out is the pure offensive and defensive domination displayed by a talented group of batters, pitchers, and fielders who are playing at a professional level," said MLB Network analyst Peter Gammons, adding that baserunning, team chemistry, and baseball players have also been highlights of 2011. "This season proves that if your club can simply outpitch, outhit, and out-field the other team, you're going to have a much better shot at competing." Experts said they expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future, noting it does not seem likely a season dominated by base coaches is coming anytime soon.
