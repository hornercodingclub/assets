HANOVER, NH--Analysts are hailing the performance of candidate John Clarkson in last Tuesday's Republican presidential debate as a clear victory for the former Colorado representative, who following a car crash eight years ago entered a coma from which he has yet to emerge. "The entire time he was on stage, Clarkson clearly displayed a level of poise, professionalism, and real charisma that, say, a Rick Perry or Mitt Romney simply fails to match," said NPR commentator Cokie Roberts, adding that the hypnotic beeping noises of Clarkson's life-support system offered an appealing contrast to Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan. "At no point did Clarkson stray from his central message, talk down to the audience, or commit any sort of glaring gaffe or tactical error, and I think that clearly set him apart from every other GOP hopeful." While some blasted Clarkson after the debate for his silence on health care, other pundits praised his strategy, saying it is to the candidate's advantage to let Mitt Romney get in as many words as possible on this issue.
