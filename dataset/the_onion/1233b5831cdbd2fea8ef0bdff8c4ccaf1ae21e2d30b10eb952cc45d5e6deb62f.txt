WASHINGTON--On the heels of yesterday's announcement that she would be running for president, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) reportedly began staffing her campaign Tuesday with unpaid inmates from California correctional facilities. "I'm so grateful to have such an incredible and devoted team headed up by my new campaign manager, Spider, as we work together to fight for American values," said Harris of the two dozen non-violent criminal offenders who would reportedly work shifts of up to 72 hours out of her campaign office in exchange for three square meals a day and all the "Kamala Harris 2020" merchandise they could carry. "Whether it's knocking on doors, leading focus groups, making phone calls, or helping prep me for upcoming media appearances, my entire staff will be comprised of unpaid prison laborers. Not only will this cut campaign-related expenses by up to $20 million, it will also allow inmates to spend time in the community and provide them with valuable work-related opportunities." Harris added that due to a quirk in California state law, most inmates would be ineligible to work for other political campaigns once they'd been released from prison.
