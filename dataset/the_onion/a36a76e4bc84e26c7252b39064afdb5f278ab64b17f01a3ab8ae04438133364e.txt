NEW YORK--Speaking to reporters while crouched on the floor of his bathroom, local man Brandon Parker confirmed Tuesday that, deep down inside, he knows he has not yet finished vomiting. "I want to believe that I can get up right now and go lie down in bed, but If I'm being honest with myself, I have to admit I'm not done here yet," said the pallid, perspiring 26-year-old, hovering over the rim of his toilet and acknowledging that, in his heart of hearts, he is fully aware he should stay right where he is. "I just don't think I could look myself in the eye right now and say, 'Well, that's over with. I'm good to go.' No, this is where I should be." After several more minutes of silent contemplation, sources reported that Parker convinced himself that he had, in fact, finished vomiting, a position he later reversed in the hallway.
