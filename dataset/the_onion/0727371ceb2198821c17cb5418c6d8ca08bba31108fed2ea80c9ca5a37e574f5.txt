According to a new report from the National Council on Teaching Quality, 1 in 6 public school teachers were "chronically absent" last year, missing 18 school days or more. What do think? "This would be a major problem if our nation's public schools didn't have such high-quality substitute teachers." Robert Nesbitt * Systems Analyst "Shame on these perpetually absent teachers for treating the American education system with the same level of respect the rest of us do." Karl Pennington * Typeface Designer "So do we cut school funding again, or what?" Michelle Oppher * Craft Services Manager
