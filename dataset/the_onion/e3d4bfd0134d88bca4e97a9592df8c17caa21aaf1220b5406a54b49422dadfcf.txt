CHICAGO--Despite broiling temperatures that have plagued the residents of the Midwest and much of the Eastern Seaboard throughout the week, local man and lifelong contrarian Martin Rivers told reporters Thursday that the ongoing heat wave does not in fact bother him. "Everyone's been complaining about the weather lately, but I've always liked when it gets nice and hot like this," the aggressively contrary man said of the recent surge of intense heat and humidity that has seen temperatures climb well into the 90s, adding that "it feels good to sweat." "I like distinct seasons, you know, and I think it's nice to have weather extremes every once in a while. I mean, it's summer; what do you expect?" At press time, those close to Rivers had confirmed that the nonconforming individual was loudly airing his hopes that the intense heat would continue through the weekend.
