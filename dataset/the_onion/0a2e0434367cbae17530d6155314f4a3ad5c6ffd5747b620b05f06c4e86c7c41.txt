CHICAGO--In addition to providing background and analysis of the artwork on display, the audio guide for the Surrealists exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago reminded visitors this week how much richer of an experience they were receiving than was everyone else, sources confirmed. "Dali was heavily influenced by Freud's and often wrote down his dreams in a notebook, a fact that those passing through this exhibit without an audio guide are woefully unaware of," the recording reportedly said before inviting listeners to turn their attention to a nearby Marcel Duchamp work whose nuances would "only truly be understood" by those listening to the prerecorded narration. "And if you look to your left, you will notice a number of attendees who are appreciating Yves Tanguy's far less than you are. Their lack of a portable audio device--and therefore insight into the prominent political movements during the period or the importance of Andre Breton's artist collective--renders them incapable of grasping the true brilliance behind Tanguy's post-war output." Sources added that the museum's members received a special audio track that mentioned no art at all and instead provided wearers with an 80-minute continuous stream of praise.
