FAYETTEVILLE, AR--Expressing frustration about the entree's preparation to his waiter, local man Chuck Harrington reportedly sent back his Applebee's steak Thursday for not being properly slathered. "I'm sorry, but this just isn't what I ordered," said Harrington, adding that anyone could plainly see that the cut of meat was barely smothered at all in Jack Daniel's Double-Barrel Whiskey Glaze. "I never do this, but look at this steak; it's not even sopping with sweet, tangy sauce. I asked for this well-drenched." At press time, Harrington had sent back his Classic Fries for being insufficiently jazzed up with cajun spices.
