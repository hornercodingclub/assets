--According to officials, Air Force One pilot Col. Scott Turner invited an excited President Obama into the cockpit Thursday, allowing the head of state to increase the throttle and place his hands on the custom-built 747's steering panel. "Hey, there, little buddy, you want to be my copilot?" Turner was overheard asking the president, who reportedly beamed as the captain's hat was placed on his head, a set of wings was pinned to his suit lapel, and he was informed that the plane was traveling 600 mph faster than a car. "No! Don't press that! Just kidding, you can press it. Want to talk to the control tower?" Later, after a shy Obama posed for a picture with Turner, the pilot confirmed he did not vote for the president in November because he is staunchly opposed to the majority of his political and personal beliefs and feels he let the country down in Iraq.
