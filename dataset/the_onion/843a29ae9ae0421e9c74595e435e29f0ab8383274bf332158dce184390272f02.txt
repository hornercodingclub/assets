MINNEAPOLIS--Days after their candidate's sudden withdrawal from the presidential race, dejected supporters of Republican Tim Pawlenty said Wednesday they could now only dream of what things might have been like if the former Minnesota governor had been able to drop out a couple months later. "Just imagine if he'd actually gotten the chance to be kicked around by pundits until October before collapsing under the weight of continually falling poll numbers and all but nonexistent support from donors," said Natalie Van Druff, a volunteer who told reporters she was struggling to accept the fact that she wouldn't be seeing Pawlenty end his campaign after a distant fourth-place finish in New Hampshire. "We put in so much work, and now we'll never get to watch him limp along for another few months as a total also-ran. It's just not fair." Van Druff added that with Pawlenty out of the race, she would reluctantly support former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, who she said had the best chance of meekly bowing out by Thanksgiving.
