After more than five months on suspension following a May 1996 crash, ValuJet Airlines has finally been given FAA clearance to resume flights to the ocean floor. ValuJet's inaugural return flight, Flight 150, is scheduled to leave Miami International Airport early Friday morning. The non-stop flight from Miami to the Atlantic Ocean is expected to arrive at its destination, a deep undersea canyon located some 50 miles off the southern tip of Greenland, at approximately 5 p.m. EST. According to ValuJet officials, all 279 passengers on-board Flight 150, including U.S. Undersecretary of Transportation William Eggiman and New Orleans Saints backup tight end Pete Washington, will be killed. A large crowd of fish and sea coral are expected to greet the plane, including a school of sharks who will eat the bodies of the dead passengers. If Flight 150 goes smoothly, ValuJet will resume a full schedule of ocean-bound flights, including regular routes from New York to the North Sea, Los Angeles to the Marianas Trench, and four non-stops daily from Chicago to Lake Michigan.
