BOSTON--Fifteen minutes after the Boston Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals to become World Series Champions, sources are now confirming that local man Bradley Ferrante, 26, is dedicating the trash can he's lighting on fire to the victims of last April's Boston Marathon bombings. "4/15, never forget!" said a visibly intoxicated Ferrante before throwing an entire book of lit matches into the trash bin, stumbling slightly before kicking it to the ground, removing his shirt, and screaming "Go Sox!" "Dynasty!" "Big Papi! We love you, Papi!" and "We're the fuckin' champs, baby! Boston Strong! Yankees suck! Woo!" At press time, Ferrante was hunched over on Boylston Street, vomiting roughly 800 yards from the marathon's finish line.
