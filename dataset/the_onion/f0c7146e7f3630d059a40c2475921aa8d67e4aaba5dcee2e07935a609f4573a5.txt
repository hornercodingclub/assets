DETROIT--Pledging to do all he can for the sickly metropolis, Tigers first baseman Prince Fielder reportedly promised Detroit, a city with a debilitating terminal condition, that the next home run he hits will be for the brave Michigan town, sources confirmed Thursday. "You've been a real champ these last few months, little bud, so I'm gonna hit one out of the ballpark just for you," said Fielder, who admitted that it broke his heart to know the ailing city didn't have much time left. "You keep watching me up there on the TV screen, okay? You're so strong. I just need you to hold on a little bit longer." At press time, sources confirmed Detroit was eagerly watching Fielder and cheering for the five-time All-Star even as its vital infrastructure started to give out.
