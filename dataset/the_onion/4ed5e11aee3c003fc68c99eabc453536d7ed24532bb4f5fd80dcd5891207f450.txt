DETROIT--After a night of bonding with new teammate Allen Iverson, Pistons players reported Sunday that the eight-time NBA All-Star responded poorly on the drive home when they unbuckled his seat belt, opened the door, and flung him out of a speeding car. "As soon as we all tried to push him out of the open door, he was screaming at us, throwing punches, and scratching at our faces," said shooting guard Richard Hamilton, adding that it took three players to toss the thrashing Iverson from the car. "He really hated it. Naturally, now that we know being forced out of a moving vehicle makes him uncomfortable, we won't do it again, but how could we know? When we did it to Rasheed Wallace, he was cracking up as he bounced and rolled down the highway." Hamilton claimed Iverson would react much more positively to the razor blades they hid in the former MVP's shoe.
