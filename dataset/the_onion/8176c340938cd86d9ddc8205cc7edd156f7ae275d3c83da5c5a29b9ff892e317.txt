LOS ANGELES--Saying that it would likely be amusing and very popular, actor Macaulay Culkin told reporters Tuesday that he hopes staff writers at the website Funny Or Die are currently coming up with ideas for a parody video he could star in. "There has to be someone over there in his late 20s who loves making fun of the 1990s and has me in mind for something," said the 32-year-old former child star, adding that he imagines a video of no more than three minutes in length that would show viewers he isn't afraid to poke fun at his own career, but would also pay homage to his place in pop-culture history. "I'm sure they've batted my name around before, and maybe a few ideas have been bounced off producers. They could do something where I'm at home alone as an adult and Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci keep trying to break into my house--like it's just this annoying routine that's become part of my life. Or it's like a parody of where a swarm of angry bees attacks me at the end of every shot. But I'm just spitballing here--this is in their wheelhouse, so I'll let them come up with the ideas." At press time, Culkin said he would be open to lampooning the end of where he falls off a cliff, but instead of plummeting to his death, his shirt becomes snagged on a tree branch and he's forced to make awkward conversation with Elijah Wood.
