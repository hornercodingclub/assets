Singer Nicki Minaj apologized this week after her new music video received widespread backlash for depicting scenes with Nazi-inspired imagery, including swastika-like symbols on red flags, saying that she "would never condone Nazism in [her] art." What do think? "The directors should know better than to create a widely shared and discussed video." Sandy Davis * Trunk Unloader "It's always such a fine line when appropriating Nazi iconography." Allen Daniels * Teleconference Coordinator "What's important is that she recognizes her mistake after a lot of backlash and bad publicity." Robert Lackey * Tape Dispenser Operator
