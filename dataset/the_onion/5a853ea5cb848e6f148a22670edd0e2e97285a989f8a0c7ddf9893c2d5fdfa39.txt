MIAMI--Giddiness overtook the locker rooms of both Super Bowl teams Thursday when members of the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts caught wind that a representative from the Pro Football Hall of Fame might be attending the game next Sunday. "Oh my God! Are you serious? Are you freakin' serious? I better go work on my out patterns," said Saints wide receiver Marques Colston, who asked his equally excited teammates if they knew where the representative from Canton might be sitting during the game. "It's the Hall of Fame, guys! The Hall of freakin' Fame!" Upon hearing the news, Colts quarterback Peyton Manning reportedly rushed to the team bathroom and began throwing up.
