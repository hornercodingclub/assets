EUGENE, OR--Oregon Ducks center Jordan Holmes expressed concern Saturday that he may have said or done something to make sophomore quarterback Darron Thomas call so many shotgun formations in the Ducks' 37-20 win over Oregon State. "Darron and I fought a little at practice earlier in the week, but I could have sworn everything was fine," said Holmes, adding that the only other thing it could be was his bumping into Thomas before the team's pregame meal, but Holmes had said he was sorry and Thomas reportedly seemed to acknowledge it was an accident. "Should I apologize? I don't think I did anything, though... I should probably apologize." Thomas later told reporters that, yes, he did call so many shotgun formations because he was mad at his center, and the reason Holmes didn't know why was half the problem.
