CHICAGO--Facing the cruel prospect of winning 200 grueling games in his interminable 19-season career, 44-year-old Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield tried to get a line drive to hit him in the head Friday to finally put an end to it all. "I didn't throw [White Sox hitters] any knuckleballs because I wanted to make sure the ball had enough speed coming off the bat to shatter my skull," said Wakefield, who lunged face-first at everything batted toward him. "I didn't give them anything they could pull, either, because it's gotta come right at me and, with any luck, nail me square in the temple so I die instantly. Then again, at this point, I would also take a deep coma." Wakefield said he was looking forward to Wednesday's start against the Cleveland Indians, calling it "another great opportunity to die."
