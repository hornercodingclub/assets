PUEBLO, CO--Admitting to feeling mixed emotions over the fact that his weekends will soon revolve around watching football, local 34-year-old Adam Gebhard told reporters Thursday that he is both incredibly excited for and somewhat dreading the coming NFL season taking up his entire Sunday for the next four months. "I've been really excited for the NFL to finally start up again, but to be honest, I kind of liked having my Sundays free to do whatever I want," said Gebhard, acknowledging that while he was thrilled to have the regular season and playoffs to look forward to, he'll just have to forget about going out for Sunday brunch or spending a relaxing afternoon at the park with friends when there are kickoffs at 11 a.m., 2:25 p.m., and 6:30 p.m. every week until February. "I'll basically roll out of bed in the morning, turn on the TV, and watch nothing but football for the next 12 hours straight. And when Sunday Night Football is over, there are highlights and analysis of every game on ESPN to catch before going to bed. It'll be awesome, but at the same time, part of me can't wait for the season to just be over." Gebhard added that he was experiencing similarly conflicting feelings about soon spending most of his week updating his fantasy football team roster and lineup.
