BRISTOL, CT--Reversing a long-held policy requiring their younger television personalities to reside at the network's sprawling 123-acre headquarters, ESPN announced Wednesday that second-year anchors will now be allowed to live in approved off-campus housing. "It's just nice to have a little freedom without having any senior producers breathing down your neck all the time," said sportscaster Jaymee Sire, adding that while she will miss ESPN's campus meal plan, she's excited to get a place with several close friends she met during her first year on the set. "The off-campus apartments are kind of dumpy, but it'll be great not having so many rules. And this way I can finally have a guy stay overnight without having to worry about signing him in first." At press time, Sire was excitedly choosing an outfit after receiving an invitation to a big kegger at Ed Werner and Bob Ley's place.
