ORLANDO, FL--Calling it "the best decision [he's] ever made," Tiger Woods adopted 11-year-old orphan Randy Gearhardt last week so he would qualify for the PGA Tour's annual Del Webb Father/Son Challenge. "I love my little Rodney [sic]--he has a good heart, and a much better short game than Vijay Singh's son," Woods said following the tandem's first-place finish in the tournament. "Even though we wouldn't have won if it weren't for me, I'm still proud of him." Now that the season is over, Woods said he is planning on spending a lot of time with his son, devoting every waking hour to molding him into the greatest golfer in the sport's history
