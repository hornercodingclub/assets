CLEVELAND--With the 11-time NBA All-Star making no move to take out his wallet after receiving his Reuben from the counter, sources at Earl's East Side Market confirmed Thursday that Cavaliers forward LeBron James was clearly expecting the deli to give him the sandwich for free. "Thanks, guys--so, all set?" said James, who reportedly looked around at several deli employees before slowly taking a couple small steps toward the door. "Yeah...looks delicious, as always. Well, I gotta go get ready for the game tonight. Thanks again." At press time, after another customer had gone up to the cashier to pay, James abruptly grabbed a small bag of chips and quickly walked out.
