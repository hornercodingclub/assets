HOLLYWOOD--Calling the last decade the most embarrassing of his 20-year-long acting career, star Christian Bale expressed relief today that his days of "dressing up in a rubber suit and pretending to be a comic book super hero" are finally over. "There wasn't a moment I went to work that I didn't feel completely idiotic affecting that ridiculous, gravelly voice or wearing that absurd black makeup under my eyes," Bale told reporters, adding that every time he looked at himself in a mirror while dressed as Batman he felt like a complete moron. "Here I am hanging from ropes, throwing around what are essentially children's toys at 'bad guys,' and then to make matters worse, I have to say things like, 'I believe in Harvey Dent.' The whole thing was mortifying." When asked what the most fulfilling moment of his acting career was, Bale mentioned any time he had to do flying splits during the dance scenes in Newsies.
