SANFORD, FL--Just days after being fully acquitted for his role in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman reportedly won the $37 million Florida Lottery jackpot last night.  "Yeah! All right!" said a visibly smiling Zimmerman, holding the winning lottery ticket he purchased on a whim hours after he was found not guilty for shooting and killing the unarmed 17-year-old. "I just figured why not, you know? I think I'll probably use the money to buy a bigger house and a new car, and I'll invest the rest. This is just fantastic. Life is good." Zimmerman added that he'll never have to worry about money again.
