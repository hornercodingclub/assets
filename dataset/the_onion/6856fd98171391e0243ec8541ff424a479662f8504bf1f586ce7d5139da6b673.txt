JACKSONVILLE, FL--Realizing that the black-and-white family photo on his bedside table seems like a scene from someone else's life, puzzled divorce David Reed admitted Tuesday that he didn't even recognize the smiling, happy people in the picture that came with the frame. "My God, it's like I don't even know who these people are," said the father of three, staring at the blandly beautiful family of four portrayed in the 5-by-7-inch picture frame originally purchased from Bed Bath & Beyond. "Whose life am I living? I mean, look at them. Who even are they? These kids, not a care. And her--she's so beautiful. She's so happy. She's almost a stranger. But you know who the real stranger here is? Me." A despondent Reed then reportedly threw the frame into the mirror over his dresser and, upon seeing his own unrecognizable face staring back at him from a hundred splintered reflections, dropped to his knees and wept uncontrollably.
