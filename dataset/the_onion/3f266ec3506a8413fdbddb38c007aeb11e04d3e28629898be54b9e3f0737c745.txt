LONDON--Noting that his treatment from colleagues recently ranged from avoiding eye contact by some to the occasional incident of spitting directly into his face by others, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie admitted Friday that the last few weeks at work have been unusually awkward. "The vibe has really changed around here, if you ask me," said the 29-year-old political operative, who suspects the recent coldness has something to do with his decision to reveal the massive scope of the company's Facebook data mining operation to authorities. "I suppose it could just be my imagination, but it honestly feels like people don't trust me much anymore. I mean, sure, I did tell journalists about our highly unethical business practices, but that doesn't mean I'm not the same old Chris, you know? Honestly, I thought it would blow over after a couple days, but everyone still seems really pissed." At press time, Wylie claimed he was considering telling journalists about the dozens of Instagram posts from office happy hours to which he was conspicuously not invited.
