BLAWNOX, PA--According to employees at Honeycutt-Talbot Communications, Associate Manager Ross Urbansky's sole professional responsibility appears to be walking around the office and periodically asking employees if they have a minute or two for a quick chat. "Essentially the only task I've ever seen Ross execute as an employee of this company is to pop by someone's desk, ask them how they're doing, and then say he's wondering if they have a second to sit down later for a real quick check-in," said human resources director Justine Griggs, adding that she sees Urbansky perform this specific function at least two or three times in the course of every workday. "I literally have never seen him do anything else. He must just be having quick chats with people all day, although I've never actually seen him a quick chat, only asking people if they have time for one. And the thing is, I'm pretty sure the guy makes over six figures." At press time, Urbansky was wondering if account manager Jeff Powell maybe had time around 3 p.m. or so for a quick chat.
