NEW YORK--Ahead of the team's first-round game against Seton Hall in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, a new report released Thursday revealed that Gonzaga is in Washington state, right? "It's up right around Seattle, isn't it?" read the report in part, which went on to speculate that Gonzaga is the name of a town or possibly a Catholic saint. "It's in the Pacific Northwest, right? Or, wait, it might be in Oregon, actually. Somewhere around there." Despite confirming Gonzaga's approximate location, the report went on to reveal that Weber State could be absolutely anywhere.
