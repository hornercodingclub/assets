MUSCAT, OMAN--Sifting through various items in his dresser and closet, 36-year-old Omani graduate student Raed Saleh told reporters Monday that he was not sure how many days' worth of airport detention clothes to bring for his upcoming trip to the United States. "I definitely want to pack enough to last me the entire time I'm detained at Newark International Airport, but I also don't want to overdo it," said Saleh, adding that five T-shirts would likely be enough to avoid having to do laundry while he is being held for questioning by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. "I'm definitely going to pack a whole week's worth of socks and underwear, and even though I doubt it'll be too cold inside the cordoned-off holding area at customs, I should definitely have a sweater just in case. But I can just wear my jeans every day and then throw on some pajama bottoms at night so I'll be comfortable sleeping inside the airport terminal." At press time, Saleh had decided to also pack a book of sudoku puzzles to occupy himself in case his phone and laptop were illegally confiscated during his detention.
