GLENDALE, AZ--Stanford quarterback and projected No. 1 NFL draft pick Andrew Luck spent the majority of his post-Fiesta Bowl interview Tuesday night discussing the superb health and dexterity of his neck. "It feels great," Luck told reporters, rolling his neck a full 360 degrees several times in both directions while letting out a pleasurable sigh. "My whole spine is really clicking right now, particularly vertebrae C2 and C3--right in the neck there. But enough about my thriving cartilaginous discs, hyoid bone, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and external carotid artery. They're all in tip-top shape, so no need to discuss them any further. Oh, hey, has anyone here ever had a kink in their neck? Because I haven't." Luck then went on to demonstrate how he looks off defenders and scans the entire football field, saying he couldn't imagine how anyone--even future Hall of Fame quarterbacks with a Super Bowl victory--could do that without a fully functioning neck.
