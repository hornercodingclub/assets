TUCSON, AZ--Kerri Strug, the former gymnast who memorably hobbled her way to Olympic gold in 1996, once again reportedly inspired the nation Sunday as she resiliently limped to the Four Star Liquor store, fighting back tears as she purchased $17.37 worth of alcohol, cigarettes, and scratch-off lottery tickets. "Soft pack of Pall Mall 100's," said Strug, who appeared to be in obvious pain and favoring her left leg as she overcame the odds and made it to the counter. "U.S. Olympian discount?" At press time, a crying Strug was triumphantly clutching her Goldschlager while being carried the final few blocks back to her apartment by a disheveled and intoxicated Bela Karolyi.
