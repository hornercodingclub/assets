WASHINGTON--Members of Sen. John McCain's family expressed deep concern Tuesday after receiving word that the aging legislator had wandered off into Syria. "Unfortunately, this has been happening a lot lately; he'll walk out of the Capitol building, get disoriented, and then we get a call late at night saying that John is in Syria," McCain's wife Cindy said upon learning that her 76-year-old husband turned up in the war-torn country after ambling across the Turkey-Syria border and delivering a rambling, incoherent speech to a group of rebels. "Then one of us has to go to Syria, pick him up, and bring him back to Washington. We're going to have to sit down soon and decide what to do about this before he seriously hurts himself." McCain's wife added that her husband's recent trip to Syria was the most alarming episode for her family since the elderly Arizona senator got into his car, started driving, and ended up lost in the 2008 presidential election.
