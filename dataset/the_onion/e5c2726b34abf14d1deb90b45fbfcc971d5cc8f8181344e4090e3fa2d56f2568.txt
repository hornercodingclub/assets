SAN FRANCISCO--In a move designed to streamline the product's interface and facilitate one of the more common interactions between customers and the ride-sharing service, Uber announced Wednesday that its newest update would allow users to file a lawsuit against the company from directly within the app. "We've listened to the community, and we're excited to introduce a feature that will make bringing litigation against us--whether for sexual harassment, racial profiling, or aggravated assault--as quick and easy as hailing a ride," said Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick, demonstrating the app's new "Sue Us" button, conveniently located in the main menu. "The app already contains all your biographical information, which integrates with GPS data to tell you how long it will take for the case to be heard, as well as the estimated cost. It also features a helpful and intuitive on-screen display that allows you to track your lawsuit's progress all the way through the courts." Kalanick added that in the event a plaintiff loses their case, Uber would automatically recoup its legal fees from the user's preferred debit or credit card.
