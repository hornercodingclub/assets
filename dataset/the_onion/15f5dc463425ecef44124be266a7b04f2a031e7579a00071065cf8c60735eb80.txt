LOS ANGELES--As news of Dom DiMaggio's death spread throughout the baseball world, few took the news as hard as the former Red Sox's one-time wife, 84-year-old librarian Gwendolyn Monroe. "He was sullen, but not too sullen," said the somewhat homely Monroe, who changed her name from Gertrude Ann Mortenson in the 1950s. "He was really there for me when I checked out of the hospital after that migraine, and he was so supportive when I married my third husband, Arthur [Mueller]. And I think that, more than anything, Dom would want to be remembered for the 34-game hitting streak he had in 1949. That was really something." Monroe refused to comment on her alleged affair with then-vice president Lyndon Johnson.
