JUPITER, FL--Insisting that he didn't want to place an undue burden on a group of people who have served him so well, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft released a statement Thursday announcing his plans to take a voluntary leave of absence from the Orchids of Asia Day Spa. "It is incredibly difficult to walk away from a place that's been like a second home to me," said the 77-year-old, who referred to his self-imposed hiatus from the spa he has poured countless hours and large sums of money into as "one of the toughest decisions I've ever made." "I'm really going to miss it. I love the staff; I know them all by name, and I'm sure they'll tell you I'm usually the first one to arrive and the last one to leave. I've always dreamed of being a part of a place like Orchids of Asia, and I just hope they can survive until my return." Kraft ended his statement by announcing that his son Joshua would assume his responsibilities at the spa while he's on leave.
