To protest government officials involvement last year in the blessing of a county road, an atheist group in Lakeland, FL "washed away" the blessing this weekend. What do think?

'Cause God already put a super force field on the blessing with a strength of infinity!" Kathryn Osborne * Roll Tender "Well, is the road fucking blessed or not? I got places to be!" Joe Feldstein * Ordinance Artificer
