HOUSTON--Revealing her total ignorance of the 1997 science-fiction classic, local resident Erin Marshall, a corporate consultant who has clearly never seen the film , reportedly complained Monday about Hollywood's lack of good acting roles for women. "When it comes to big-budget movies, women are always forced to play either a one-dimensional heroine or a bland, forgettable love interest for a male protagonist," said Marshall, who is doubtlessly unfamiliar with Milla Jovovich's star-making turn as super-powered extraterrestrial humanoid Leeloo, a complex and compelling character exhibiting emotional vulnerability, extreme intelligence, and a wide range of martial arts talents. "There's an unsettling scarcity of parts that celebrate and challenge the female actor, and it's just really disappointing [that I've never seen the cinematic tour de force that is , and still remain unaware of Jovovich learning an entire fictional language to prepare for the film]." At press time, Marshall's argument that there are also no good roles for African-American actors was thoroughly disproved by Chris Tucker's iconic portrayal of flamboyant talk show host Ruby Rhod.
