YOUR LOCATION--Noting that it's important to be prepared in case of emergencies but it's also a good thing to know in general, your dad announced today that he wants to show you where the fuse box is. "If something goes wrong and the lights go off, you're going to want to know how to get to this," your father reportedly said while leading you down the basement stairs, before opening the gray metal panel on the wall and pointing out each of the 12 individual electrical switches. "This one goes to the washer-dryer, and these go to the kitchen. If you blow a fuse somewhere and something stops working, you've got to find the correct one and push it over to 'off,' and then flip it back on again. This is the main power breaker; don't touch that one." At press time, your dad added that as long as we're at it, he might as well teach you how to relight the pilot light on the furnace, too.
