SAN JOSE, CA--Reveling at the opportunity to respond to an online post with the quintessential short, silent video loop, local fucking idiot Greg Knott told reporters Thursday that he has the perfect GIF for that. "Oh, man, this is totally spot-on," announced the knuckle-dragging dumbass whose very existence is a testament to the depths of human stupidity. Several reports indicated that the utter dipshit struggled not to drool on himself while scrolling through his archives of .gif files of Jonah Hill, Donald Glover, Larry David, Judge Judy, Kayode Ewumi, Donald Trump, Chuck Norris, Robert Redford, and others saved on his computer desktop before deeming the three-second looped reaction shot of Will Ferrell in as the ideal contribution to the conversation. At press time, the slobbering moron reportedly muttered, "hell yeah, that's a good one," and basked in the fruits of his internet curating efforts, seemingly oblivious to the fact that 78 other total fucking halfwits had the exact same stupid-ass idea.
