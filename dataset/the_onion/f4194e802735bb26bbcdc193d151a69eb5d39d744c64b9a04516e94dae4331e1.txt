BIRMINGHAM, AL--In an effort to recognize the group's pivotal role in helping elect Democrat Doug Jones to the Senate, the DNC took out a full-page ad Wednesday in thanking Alabama's working-class white voters. "To each and every white, working-class Alabaman who made their voices heard yesterday: We thank you," read the advertisement in part, adding that Democrats were able to achieve the unimaginable in one of the most conservative states in the nation because "White Alabama believed in doing what's right and turned out to vote like never before." "You in the white working-class are the reason the Democratic Party took another step toward reclaiming government for all Americans. Caucasians, we will not forget you." The ad went on to salute white working-class males as the most unsung heroes of all.
