"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child," the companion book to the stage production that follows Harry Potter's life as a grown man and father to three children, has broken sales records to become the fastest-selling script book of all time. What do you think? "Man, that'll be a lot of competing productions." Keith Kunkel * Cheese Sampler "I don't see how it can possibly top Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7." Viktor Blaine * Staple Separator "I can't wait to delve into this new chapter of the Harry Potter saga and see what Dumbledore, Dobby, Mad-Eye Moody, Snape, Lupin, Tonks, Fred, and Hedwig are up to!"
