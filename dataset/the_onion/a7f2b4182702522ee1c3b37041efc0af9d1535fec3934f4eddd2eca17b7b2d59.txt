WAYZATA, MN--Regularly updating her husband and children on the frequency and location of sightings around the neighborhood, local mother Dana Salisbury continued to keep close tabs on the coyote situation this week, sources confirmed. "I saw on the television how more people have been seeing coyotes in our neck of the woods, and then just the other day Kevin and Lisa [Torrance] from down the block had one right in their backyard," said Salisbury, adding that after watching a cautionary report on the local news she had been taking extra care to make sure their garbage can lids were tightly secured. "They look like dogs from far away, but they have bushier tails. We haven't seen any coyotes by us yet, but just to be on the safe side we aren't letting the cat out. Susanne next door said her brother and sister-in-law in Bloomington almost had their corgi get attacked by one." At press time, Salisbury was reportedly standing at the window and vigilantly scanning the family's chain-link fence for potential weak spots.
