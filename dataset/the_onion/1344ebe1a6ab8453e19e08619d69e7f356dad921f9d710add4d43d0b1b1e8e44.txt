NEW YORK--Calling it an everyday struggle for millions of young dudes, a new report released Friday by researchers at New York University found that those suffering from buddy dysmorphia experience a skewed, deeply negative perception of the shapes of their friends. "It doesn't matter if I'm at home, at the gym, or at a bar--every time I look at my buddy I'm disgusted," said Mike Oscoff, 19, a study participant who said he was ashamed to admit it, but half the time, he wished he could just keep his embarrassing buddy covered up. "I mean, we live in a society that constantly tells us our buddies aren't good enough. After living your whole life with buddy-shame issues, it's no wonder some of us just sit home alone." Oscoff added that he'd like to be proud of his buddy because, after all, he only has one.
