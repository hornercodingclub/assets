RECIFE, BRAZIL--In a surprising disclosure of tactics before his team's World Cup match against Germany, U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard announced Thursday that he will frantically wave his arms around and yell at teammates prior to any corner kick. "As soon as everyone is in the box, I'll just start pointing at various opposing players while screaming at my defenders with one hand cupped around my mouth," said Howard, stressing that he will also yell "Hey!" repeatedly while gesturing toward anyone not being marked tightly by a U.S. player. "I'll also try to shove away any guys from the other team crowding me at the goal line, before eventually running out and trying to punch the ball away as hard as I can. And I will repeat this process for every single corner kick in the match." Howard refused to confirm his plans for any free kicks on his goal, but hinted that they may involve leaning on the goalpost and repeatedly pointing either left or right while staring at his wall of defenders.
