GREEN BAY--Veteran quarterback Brett Favre promised fans and teammates that he will not let them down while playing in his first NFC championship game in 10 years this coming Sunday, vowing that he would throw the football as far and as hard as he possibly can. "The Packers have come to expect a certain caliber of performance from me, specifically that I throw the ball a real long ways," Favre told reporters at a press conference after a Tuesday practice in which coaches said he was throwing the football as far as he did when he was in his twenties. "And I won't let them down on Sunday. Not only will I throw that ball a long ways, I'm going to throw it real, real hard, too." After Favre's announcement, Packers coach Mike McCarthy announced that Wednesday's practice would concentrate on running the Hail Mary when inside the Giants' five-yard line.
