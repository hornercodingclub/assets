CLEVELAND--Following the Wizards' 30-point loss to the Cavaliers Monday, Washington guard Gilbert Arenas assured reporters that he would play in Game 3 of the series despite severely wrenching his right arm's ankle while fouling LeBron James. "I definitely have some inflammation in the joint between the arm and my shooting foot, but I'm going to ice it and keep my weight off of it for the next couple days," said Arenas, who was limited to seven points in Game 2. "I should be fine, especially since I didn't get a high ankle sprain on the upper part of the arm. Those never heal." Arenas, who has been plagued by injuries recently, missed 69 regular season games after having reconstructive surgery to correct a shoulder separation in his right leg.
