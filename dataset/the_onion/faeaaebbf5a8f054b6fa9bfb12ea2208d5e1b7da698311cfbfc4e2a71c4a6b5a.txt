MT. VERNON, OH--Loudly explaining to anyone within earshot that both the left and right were ruining the level of discourse in this country, Jesse Levin, a man firmly in the center of the political spectrum, is under the impression that he is less obnoxious than those with more partisan viewpoints, sources reported Friday. "We're never going to get anywhere in this country if you lunatics keep foaming at the mouth about some one-sided fantasyland," said Levin, 32, who despite characterizing those who do not stand precisely equidistant between two ideological extremes as "raving fanatics" and repeatedly interrupting people before they can fully explain their "nutjob" beliefs, reportedly seems to think he is, in fact, much more civil. "If you idiots stopped throwing temper tantrums every time some little thing doesn't pass your precious purity test and came back down to the real, complicated world with the rest of us, we'd all be a lot better off." At press time, Levin was butting in on a lively social media debate to tell two total strangers that they were "everything that's wrong with this country."
