GILBERT, AZ--Saying they couldn't bear to see their boy upset, unhappy local couple Denise and Peter Gale resolved to stay together for the sake of one of their children, 7-year-old Daniel, sources reported Monday. "It would just break Daniel's heart if we did this to him while he's still so young--I can't even imagine how awful that would be for him," said the 36-year-old mother of three, adding that she wouldn't be able to handle the devastated look on her oldest child's face when they sat him down and told him they were getting divorced. "At the very least, we'll wait a while until he's off to college and the house is a little quieter. Then maybe it's something we can address." Gale added that if another decade of marital strife was the price she would have to pay to give her first son a happy childhood, it was well worth it.
