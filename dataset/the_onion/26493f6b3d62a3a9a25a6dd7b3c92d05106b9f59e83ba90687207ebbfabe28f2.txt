BELLINGHAM, WA--After watching his beloved Seattle Mariners prevail against the San Diego Padres, third-grader Timmy Hastert was moved to ask his father, 46-year-old insurance salesman Christopher Hastert, why interleague play is "good." "Well, it lets people see the teams they normally don't get to see all that often, I think is the point, there, buddy," Hastert said after beginning three different sentences in seven minutes.  "After all, without interleague play, we wouldn't get to see players like...like Brian Giles and Scott [Linebrink], would we? Although I think we play the Yankees and Red Sox less often as a result. Right? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's how they do it." In a moving but ultimately doomed effort to give his impressionable boy the right messages, Christopher also attempted to answer Timmy's questions regarding why only the American League has a DH, why and how the All-Star game now "counts," what performance-enhancing drugs are, and how baseball officials could have sat idly by when they knew there was a major steroid problem in their sport.
