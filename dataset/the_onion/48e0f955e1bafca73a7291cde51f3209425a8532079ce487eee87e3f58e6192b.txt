NEW YORK--Lifelong Yankees fan Martin Stenowitz, 52, became one of many who took home a piece of Yankee Stadium property Sunday night when he stole All-Star shortstop Derek Jeter off the field after the game. "I wanted my own little piece of Yankee Stadium history, so when I saw Derek Jeter just standing there, I thought, what the heck," said Stenowitz, who carefully folded the game-used Yankee shortstop into his backpack and exited the stadium before security personnel or New York City police could apprehend him. Stenowitz now proudly displays Jeter on the mantel of his New Rochelle, NY home, next to the program from the final game and Bernie Williams' head. The Yankee organization is demanding that Derek Jeter be immediately returned to the team in his original condition, as the Yankees were planning to sell him for $400.
