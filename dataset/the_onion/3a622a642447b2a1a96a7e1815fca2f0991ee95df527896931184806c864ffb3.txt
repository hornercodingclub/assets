KANSAS CITY, MO--Sadly watching from the dugout as the lone spectator refused to abandon the game, the players of the Kansas City Royals confirmed this week that they were concerned about a fan who stuck out a three-hour rain delay. "I hope he's okay, I mean, we appreciate the support, but it's coming down in sheets and this game has absolutely zero playoff implications," said third-baseman Mike Moustakas, who expressed concern that the fan had seemingly nothing better to do for an entire evening than wait for a mid-season baseball game to restart while sitting through a torrential downpour. "He's all the way up in the 400 level--he doesn't even have good seats. I mean, it's the middle of the week, shouldn't he have a family or someone to go home to? Maybe we should send up a security guard to ask if he's okay?" At press time, the fan had gotten up to leave after being unable to endure an interminably long eighth inning.
