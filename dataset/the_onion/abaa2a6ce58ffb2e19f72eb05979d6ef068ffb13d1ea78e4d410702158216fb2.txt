WASHINGTON--Evoking the law that assures citizens access to government records, Vice President Joe Biden made a Freedom of Information Act request Friday, calling for the immediate release of documents disclosing when Jennifer Britmore gets off work.  "It is of utmost importance that government maintain openness and transparency so we can better prepare ourselves to be there when Jenny clocks out," Biden's statement read in part. "Moving forward, it will be vital to have access to information regarding her schedule, phone number, and whether or not those legs go up all the way."  Biden then contacted his sources in the Labor Department to request Britmore's resume in order to better determine if she would let the attorney general watch.
