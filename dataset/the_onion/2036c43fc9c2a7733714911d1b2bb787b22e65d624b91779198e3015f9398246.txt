At least one local news station is reporting that teenagers are engaging in a new trend called "beezin," which apparently involves applying Burt's Bees lip balm to the eyelids to experience a tingling sensation from the peppermint oil.

Cassidy Wilcox * Revenue Agent "If they can find something fun to do with lip balm, then more power to them." Dick Galligan * Pipefitter "They wouldn't have to resort to lip balm if Visine made an eye drop with some balls." Donald Cates * Insurance Collector
