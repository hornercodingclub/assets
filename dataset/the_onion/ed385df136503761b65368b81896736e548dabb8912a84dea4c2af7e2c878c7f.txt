NASA has announced an open call for civilians to submit their ideas on how to turn Mars' abundance of basalt rock into building material, fuel, or other tools astronauts can use throughout their stay on the planet so as to lower the cost of launching supplies from Earth, a contest that will award $10,000 to the best proposal. What do think? "It's bold of NASA to offer their budget as prize money." Elaine Nathan * Lighting Designer "If there's one challenge humanity has proven surmountable, it's finding new ways to exploit resources." Randall Delaney * Radio Critic "My basalt innovations are not for sale." Kurt Tuttle * Waterfowl Tracker
