MIAMI--Visiting Clippers forward Blake Griffin stunned spectators and opponents alike Sunday with a death-defying dunk executed by releasing the ball a full 20 feet from the basket. "Oh my God, he was literally almost back near the three-point line when he started the dunk, and then the ball suddenly left his hands," said game attendee Matt Harmon, adding that at one point the ball was "like 8 or 10 feet above the rim" and that it seemed to hang in the air forever before sailing through the hoop. "I've never seen anything like it." Later in the game, Griffin performed an encore of sorts, wowing the crowd with a one-point dunk he released 15 feet from the hoop after being fouled.
