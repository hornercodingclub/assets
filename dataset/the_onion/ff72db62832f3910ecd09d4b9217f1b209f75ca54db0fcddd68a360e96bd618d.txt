Starbucks said it would stop using cochineal beetles to color its strawberry Frappuccinos and switch to a tomato-based food coloring. What do think? "It's a shame they can't just make a strawberry Frappuccino out of some kind of naturally red fruit." Penny Emge * Systems Analyst "Great. Now how am I supposed to be the weird guy at Starbucks who impresses girls with his knowledge of what's in their strawberry Frappucino?" Winston Reninger * Doffer "Thank goodness cockroaches just crawl right into Dunkin' Donuts coffee machines every day so that I can still get my morning insect fix." Blaine Foree * Screwhead Polisher
