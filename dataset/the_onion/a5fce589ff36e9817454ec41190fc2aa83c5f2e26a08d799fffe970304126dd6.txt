ROCHESTER, NY--After sitting through an outdoor ceremony officiated by the groom's best friend, local parents Scott and Linda McNeil were clinging to the lone religious element of their daughter's wedding, sources confirmed Saturday. "The vows they wrote for each other were nice, but the passage from Corinthians they used on the back of the wedding program was just beautiful," said Linda McNeil, adding that she and her husband were both deeply touched by the inclusion of the biblical quote "Love still stands when all else has fallen," which appeared beneath a verse from a Sarah McLachlan song. "I've always loved that passage, and it's a part of the Scripture that really captures who they are." McNeil then added that she knew the small image of a dove above the quote would have made her late mother very happy.
