CAIRO--Following countrywide protests against President Mohamed Morsi's sweeping assertions of executive power, sources confirmed Tuesday that, just so you know, there's no chance whatsoever that Egypt is emerging from all this with a functional and active democracy. "These decrees are temporary and exist only to ensure a smooth transition to a representative government for all Egyptians," Morsi said in a recent statement, which, to be clear, is not indicative of anything that will actually happen and only masks an inevitable future in which the fundamental democratic rights of every Egyptian citizen continue to be oppressed. "This level of authority is necessary in order to implement a new constitution, appoint a democratically elected parliament, and [a bunch of other carefully crafted rhetorical bullshit that is totally meaningless since the people of Egypt will in no way be allowed to have any real say in the political or ideological future of their country, which, again, will not in reality resemble anything close to a true democracy whether this guy remains in power or not]." Sources also concluded that, in case you were wondering, many more protesters are going to wind up in jail or dead by the time this thing is all over.
