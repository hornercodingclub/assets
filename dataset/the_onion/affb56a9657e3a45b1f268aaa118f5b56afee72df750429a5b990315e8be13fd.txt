WASHINGTON--Explaining that she always makes sure to leave enough time in her busy schedule to give them the proper attention, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway told reporters Thursday, in what is her most disturbing public statement to date, that she has four young children. "I have four little ones, 12-year-old twins and an 8- and 7-year-old," said Conway, sending shockwaves through the nation with the deeply unsettling comment, which inspired more horror than any remarks she has made sugarcoating the grave impact the president's policies will have on millions of Americans, delegitimizing the press, or fabricating entire terrorist attacks in order to vilify immigrant populations. "With all that's going on around them, it's important that I instill them with my values when they're young. No matter what, I want to make sure I'm a big part of their lives." The nation was reportedly further aghast when Conway mentioned she had raised her two older children to guide the younger ones when she wasn't around.
