Here are some of the most memorable: 1902: Theodore Roosevelt honors self after felling particularly large elk 1943: After a perfunctory greeting, Franklin D. Roosevelt orders the world champion Yankees to get back to the front immediately 1974: Hard-nosed running back Larry Csonka of the NFL champion Miami Dolphins presents a ceremonial game ball to Gerald Ford, breaking the president's arm in four places 1978: Officials struggle to maintain order, several high-ranking Generals are flabbergasted, and President Carter dodges a bucketful of confetti during the Harlem Globetrotters' annual White House visit 1987: Ronald Reagan regales the Mets with more cocaine stories than they can handle 1992: Duke forward Grant Hill feels like a complete idiot for bringing a big bowl of fruit salad to the ceremony 1999: After being told President Clinton is "very busy," the WNBA champion Houston Comets are greeted by Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater 2004: Although the Marlins are the reigning World Series champs, George W. Bush invites the Texas Rangers for a visit instead
