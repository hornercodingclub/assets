NEW YORK--With the candidate facing a far more formidable challenge than expected in her pursuit of the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign released an exceedingly defensive new commercial Wednesday titled "Who Are You To Judge Me?" "What the hell have done?" a scowling Clinton asks during the music-free 30-second ad that is running in markets in all 50 states and features the candidate standing by herself in front of a black background, speaking directly to the camera with her arms crossed defiantly. "Have you ever been a senator? Had to consider the interests and needs of millions of constituents? Oh, wait, know--you must have served in the president's cabinet and delicately handled international affairs that impacted the entire world. I'm sorry, what's that? You ? Then maybe you should think for a goddamn minute before you pass judgment on me, you ingrates." The ad reportedly ends with Clinton pointing menacingly at the viewer for a full 10 seconds before wordlessly walking out of frame.
