LOS ANGELES--After an extended hiatus, HBO's kicked off its third season last night with a scene featuring every one of the epic fantasy drama's characters being rapidly fingered as they discussed the arrival of the winter season. "Winter is coming, and with it a dark scourge that shall leave no man untouched, no kingdom unconquered," says one of the show's protagonists, Jon Snow, as the characters Catelyn Stark and Mance Rayder rapidly insert their fingers into his rectum while the rest of the show's extensive cast also expound on the return of winter while having their own anuses and vaginas vigorously fingered. "These are dark days that await us, brethren. May the gods show us mercy, if indeed mercy they have." Though viewer reception to the season premiere has been positive, fans of the hit series were reportedly disappointed that the episode failed to resolve the previous season's cliffhanger in which a nude Tyrion Lannister eagerly masturbated a dragon for half an hour.
