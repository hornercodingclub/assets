CLEVELAND--A week after hiring the former Lakers head coach, Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Chris Grant announced at a press conference Wednesday that the team was most excited about Mike Brown's total willingness to coach the Cavaliers. "From the moment he expressed some interest, we knew we had our guy," said Grant, detailing the rigorous interview process they conducted with Brown to ensure the one-time NBA Coach of the Year was serious. "Obviously, we like his experience and trust his ability to develop the young talent on our team, but what really sold us most was the fact that he evidently wants to coach here. We honestly couldn't say that about any other candidates we considered." After finishing with the league's third-worst record, Grant said the Cavaliers will next turn their attention to the draft, where they hope to add yet another talented young player who doesn't want to be in Cleveland.
