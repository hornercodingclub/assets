SOCHI, RUSSIA--Traveling from 88 nations around the world, hundreds of athletes reportedly arrived in Sochi this week in order to participate in a two-week-long waking nightmare. "Just got to the Olympic Village!" said U.S. skier Lauren Price, who like her fellow Olympians will spend the next half month in mortal terror while under constant, intrusive surveillance by police forces desperately trying to preserve safety and calm. "So excited for [a harrowing, hellish experience that may well include full-scale security lockdowns, dismal living conditions, contaminated water, direct threats to my life, insufficient city infrastructure, and human rights abuses occurring in plain sight]." Sources confirmed the very best outcome any athlete could hope for was that the pet project of a corrupt, bigoted regime would be carried out exactly according to plan.
