NEW YORK--With the launch Tuesday of a massive nationwide ad campaign, athletic footwear manufacturer Adidas has officially unveiled the Adidas Bystander, the first shoe designed for running away from a mass public shooting. "From its reinforced tread engineered specifically for running in a zigzag pattern to its whisper-quiet, low-squeak rubber, the Bystander combines speed and stealth to create the perfect shoe for escaping or hiding from an armed murderer," Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer said at a press conference. "And its brand-new Firmo-Grip sole minimizes slippage, even when you're panicked and need to move quickly through puddles of freshly spilled blood. No shoe has ever been better suited for today's running, crouching, and cowering needs." The shoes, which go on sale at the end of the month, will be available for wearers as young as 5.
