Addressing criticism of his upcoming film Great Wall, in which he plays a savior of China, Matt Damon denied that his portrayal is an instance of Hollywood "whitewashing." What do think? "It's not like the role was written for a Chinese actor and Damon usurped it. The film was designed from the beginning to be culturally tone-deaf." Derek Steffans * Circuit Dismantler "I'd be more inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt had I not just seen the latest Bourne installment." Carla Price * Informant's Apprentice "He already told everyone they were wrong. What more do you want?" Terrance O'Day * Faucet Tightener
