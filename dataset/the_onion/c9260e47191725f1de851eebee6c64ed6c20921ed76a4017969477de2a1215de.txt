WHITE PLAINS, NY--Powerless to break free from the department store's grip, local mom Patricia Schulte, 54, is locked in an infinite loop of purchasing and returning items from Lord & Taylor, sources said Wednesday. "It's always the same--she goes out and buys a few things, and then, lo and behold, she's back at the mall a couple of days later to return part, if not all, of the items," Schulte's daughter Emily said of the unrelenting cycle, adding that her mother has been known to buy a top or a belt at Lord & Taylor only to bring it back the very next day without even having taken it out of the bag. "There's no beginning and no end. I don't know if she has any reasons at all for her behavior or whether it's just an unconscious reflex. Whatever it is, she's trapped." At press time, the elder Schulte had received word of Lord & Taylor's Spring Clearance Sale, dashing any hope that she would liberate herself anytime soon.
