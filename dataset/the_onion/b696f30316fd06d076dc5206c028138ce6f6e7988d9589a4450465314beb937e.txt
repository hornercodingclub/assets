WASHINGTON--Conceding that designing plays is a difficult task, Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan admitted Thursday that his mother, Peggy, helped him create most of the formations, schemes, and strategies in the Washington playbook. "My mom is so nice about it. I sometimes have trouble figuring out the blocking--especially what to do with the guards--and she always helps me, no problem," said Shanahan, adding that his mother is "way, way better" at getting Robert Griffin III space to run. "I'd ask my dad, but lots of times he gets upset that I can't figure things out, instead of just helping me and making me feel good." Kyle Shanahan, who confirmed that he talks to his mother on his headset during games, said that she offers encouragement as well as advice on how to get the tight ends more involved.
