PROVO, UT--Local man Keith Steinhauer reportedly took a moment Tuesday to wistfully look around Slate.com, noting how much the website had changed since he had last visited 30 minutes earlier. "Man, the last time I was here all the top stories were different--none of these links even existed a half hour ago," said a nostalgic Steinhauer, reminiscing about how at least three of the posts in the "Most Shared" section had disappeared since he had gotten up to refill his coffee. "I remember back when there were only 13 comments at the bottom of this article. Now, it's got something like 19, and a lot even have replies. Who knows what it'll look like 60 minutes from now." Steinhauer later told reporters that he was at least comforted by the fact that the StubHub banner ad still remained from earlier in the day.
