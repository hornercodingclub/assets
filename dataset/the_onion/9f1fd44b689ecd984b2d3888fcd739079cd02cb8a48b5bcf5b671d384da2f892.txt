Producers for HBO Max's new say the show will not include guns and that Elmer Fudd will hunt Bugs Bunny with a scythe, though the series will still feature other forms of cartoon violence such as explosives and other Acme products. What do think? "Those p roducers better be ready to answer for the surge in scythe-related violence this will ultimately inspire." Orville Perkel Sock Darner "That's smart. Statistically, cartoon hunters with guns end up hurting themselves 100% of the time." Andrew Morro Evidence Planter "I'll miss Elmer Fudd's rifle, but I agree there are plenty of other funny ways to murder someone." Brianna Cimini * 2nd Violinist
