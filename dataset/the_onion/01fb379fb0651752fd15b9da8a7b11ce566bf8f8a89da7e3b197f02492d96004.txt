HAVANA--After struggling all year with control problems possibly related to his radical delivery, lefty Cuban hurler Fidel Castro has placed himself on the disabled list to undergo Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow, allowing Fidel's brother Raul Castro to be called up and given his spot in the rotation. "I provisionally delegate my pitching responsibilities to my brother while I recover from this minor, common, and statistically safe surgical procedure," Fidel said in a written statement. "I have full confidence that Raul will continue our successful campaign. This is not a time to let up in our pursuit of our goals. Onward to victory!" Raul, who has spent his entire professional career in the shadow of his older and more talented brother, is said to have potential as a short reliever despite lacking Fidel's raw power. 2
