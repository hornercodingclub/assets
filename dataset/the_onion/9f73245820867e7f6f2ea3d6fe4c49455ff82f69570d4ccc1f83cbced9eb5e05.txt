WASHINGTON--Tiptoeing across the floor of his bathroom in stockinged feet to quiet his approach, California Representative Devin Nunes reportedly shouted, "Aha!" Thursday before pulling back a shower curtain in the hopes of revealing a hidden FBI agent. "You thought you could hide from me," the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee screamed into the empty bathtub before cursing softly, diving to the floor, and rolling down the hallway to the kitchen where he proceeded to yank open cabinet doors, the refrigerator, and the oven's broiler drawer while attempting to find a FBI agent concealed inside. "The jig is up! I've got you bastards now!"At press time, a bleary-eyed Nunes was frantically tearing all the stuffing out of his couch cushions in an unsuccessful attempt to locate an FBI surveillance van.
