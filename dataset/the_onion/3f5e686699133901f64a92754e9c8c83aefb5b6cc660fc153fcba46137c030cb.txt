NEW YORK--Following the Jets 23-17 Monday night loss to the Houston Texans, Jets backup quarterback Tim Tebow reportedly stayed up until morning compulsively refreshing the team's depth chart on ESPN.com to see if his name had been switched to the starting position. Sources confirmed Tebow repeatedly clicked the browser's "reload" icon and created several new tabs of the Jets' depth chart page, apparently suspecting the content would be updated at any moment. "Come on, come on," said the third-year player, who at several points checked the analogous depth chart at SportsIllustrated.com "just in case they updated it first." "Come on--it still says second string." Shortly before falling asleep at 5:15 a.m., a bleary-eyed Tebow told reporters he was certain the number next to his name had, for a fraction of a second, switched to a three.
