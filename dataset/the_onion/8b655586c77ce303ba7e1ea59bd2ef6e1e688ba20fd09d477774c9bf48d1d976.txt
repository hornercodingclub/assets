ST. LOUIS--With the ball on their opponent's 45-yard line last Sunday, the Rams allowed the game clock to expire during first down so they could take in the unusual sight of their rich, beautiful field position. "Wow, it's gorgeous around here," running back Steven Jackson said while running his hands through the artificial turf and inhaling deeply. "It's a shame we hardly ever get this far. Just look at the view--you can almost see the other end zone from here! I really wish we got to do this more often." According to sources, the team was so excited they took second and third down off as well, evidently just choosing to lie down and relax.
