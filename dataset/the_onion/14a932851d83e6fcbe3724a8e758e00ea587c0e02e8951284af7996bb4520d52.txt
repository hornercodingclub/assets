ASHBURN, VA--Redskins coach Mike Shanahan announced Tuesday that quarterback Robert Griffin III will undergo further medical tests assessing the condition of the unrecognizable, ragged mess that was once the rookie's right knee. "We're not sure of the exact situation with Robert's bloody, distended bulge around what formerly resembled a working joint," said Shanahan, who explained that when he elected to play Griffin against the Seahawks, some cartilage was still connected to the bone, enabling the star quarterback to run and remain upright without hurting himself. "Doctors will continue to examine the useless, visibly throbbing tangle of tattered ligaments until they are confident about what to do next." Shanahan added that regardless of the test results, he would instruct Griffin to continue running intensive speed and agility drills throughout the offseason.
