DULUTH, MN--Breaking a silence that had lasted for several years, a long-dormant Facebook friend of local resident Maureen Sussman reportedly came out of the woodwork Wednesday with a status update asking how to properly insulate windows. "She hadn't shared a link or a photo or anything in at least three years, and then suddenly she comes out of nowhere with a question about weatherproofing," said Sussman, noting that the post appeared next to a profile photo that was apparently unchanged since college and read in part, "Anyone know how to seal windows for winter??" "It's crazy to finally hear from her. I checked her page, and the last thing she posted was on December 20, 2012, wishing everybody 'happy holidays.' I can only imagine a lot has happened in her life since then, but all we know is that she has a draft in her house she wants to seal up." At press time, the long-silent friend had reportedly continued her unexplained Facebook resurgence by posting a follow-up comment inquiring whether "that 3M spray foam stuff works."
