LOS ANGELES--Sharing the observation with teammates and coaches, Clippers power forward Blake Griffin reportedly insisted on several occasions Monday that the NBA official game basketball seems much rounder lately. "Now, whenever I touch the ball, it definitely feels way more curvier," said Griffin, who appeared lost in thought while slowly running his fingers along the basketball's surface before declaring that the object looked "extra spherical." "Maybe they started putting in super-strong circles when they make the basketballs, because I swear right now there's a whole lot more roundness." At press time, Griffin had reportedly concluded that the basketball was probably pregnant.
