ST. LOUIS--Unsure whether it was the famous boxer's birthday, his death, the anniversary of one of his historic fights, or some other previously unknown connection to St. Louis, a bewildered crowd at the Edward Jones Dome remained confused Friday night as to why Muhammad Ali was being honored during a preseason game between the Rams and Falcons. "Oh my God, wow, is he actually here or something?" asked Rams fan Chris Anderson, whose confusion was not cleared up after watching a montage of Ali on the JumboTron. "Okay, looks like we're giving him a standing ovation now. That's fine. I mean, it's Muhammad Ali." According to stadium officials, the mysterious ceremony honoring the former heavyweight champion was a commercial for Budweiser American Ale.
