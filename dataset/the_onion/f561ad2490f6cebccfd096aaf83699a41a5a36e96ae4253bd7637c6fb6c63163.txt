After Olive Garden announced it would sell a limited number of $100 "Never Ending Pasta Passes," giving customers an unlimited supply of pasta, breadsticks, and Coca-Cola-branded soft drinks for 49 days, the promotion sold out within 45 minutes. What do think? "I pray for anyone who actually gets their money's worth." Madeline Patterson * Glue Gun Supervisor "Those passes are just for suckers who don't know what time Olive Garden takes out its garbage." Roy Thornton * HDMI Cord Expert "Smart. The only reason I stopped going there in the first place was that, no matter what, there was always some point in the evening when I had to stop eating." Anthony Ford * Pen Cap Collector
