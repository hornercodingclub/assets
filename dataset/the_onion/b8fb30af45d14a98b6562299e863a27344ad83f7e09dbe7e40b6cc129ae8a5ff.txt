NEW YORK--ESPN.com launched an updated version of its MLB GameCast feature Monday that automatically changes any game's outcome in favor of the user's favorite team. "I used to think that being able to toggle the 'HitZone' on and off was pretty awesome, but toggling a victory on and off is so much better," Mariners fan and GameCast subscriber Mike Walker said. "Most of the time, I'd be following along with the game online and then be pissed off when the Mariners lost. Now, all I have to do is hit the 'make my team win' button." Although the new premium feature is not available for the NFL or NBA GameCasts, baseball fans can obtain the new program by signing up for ESPN Insider and paying a $1,000 monthly subscription fee.
