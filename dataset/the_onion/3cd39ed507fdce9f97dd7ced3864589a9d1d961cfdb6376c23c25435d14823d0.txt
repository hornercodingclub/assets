After four unsuccessful attempts, 64-year-old Diana Nyad this weekend became only the second person to swim from Cuba to Florida and the first to do so without the aid of a shark cage, traversing the 110-mile distance in 53 hours. What do think? "It just goes to show that if you don't give up, you can swim really far for no discernible reason." Murphy Lang * Unemployed "I'm not that impressed because I do a lot without the aid of a shark cage." Dylan Kepler * Novelty Shirt Vendor "I'd rather just grow out my fingernails indefinitely, thanks." Laetitia Ramon * Museum Curator
