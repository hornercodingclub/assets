STATE COLLEGE, PA--In response to the unprecedented NCAA sanctions levied against Penn State for the Jerry Sandusky child-abuse scandal, the 45,000 students enrolled in the school began openly wondering Monday why they were still attending the university. "I came here because I love football, and all I want to do is go to games with my friends on Saturdays," said confused sophomore Matthew Spencer, 19, studying the specifics of the four-year postseason ban, $60 million fine, and 20 scholarship reductions imposed on the football program. "If football is out of the picture, why am I here right now? Is it to go to class? Is that what I'm here for? Do I even care about that?" As of press time, every single member of Penn State's student body was reportedly browsing the fall semester transfer policies of Ohio State, Alabama, LSU, and Oklahoma State.
