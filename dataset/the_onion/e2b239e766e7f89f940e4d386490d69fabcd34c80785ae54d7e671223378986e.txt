LOUISVILLE, KY--Following the publication of a book alleging that a member of the school's basketball department paid women to perform sex acts for recruits, furious University of Louisville head coach Rick Pitino told reporters Wednesday that the media was trying to tarnish the name of a great escort service. "No one, I repeat no one, in the Cardinals community has anything but good things to say about these ladies, and it's absolutely shameful to see their names get dragged through the mud," said an enraged Pitino, blasting news outlets for maliciously attacking the reputation of a highly regarded, hardworking escort service. "To say I'm disgusted and disappointed with the way the press has recklessly tried to cast aspersions on this escort service would be an understatement. Say what you will about me, I'm the coach of this team, but I won't stand for the media smearing these women and the outstanding services they provide." Pitino added that he was confident the university's independent investigation would find grounds for legal action against members of the press for defamation of the escort service's character.
