LOUISVILLE, KY--Having trotted to an underpass on the outskirts of the city where they were surrounded by numerous entourages and bikini-clad women, over a dozen unregistered horses reportedly met under the cover of darkness Saturday for an illegal Kentucky Street Derby. "We usually meet here to race because it's out of the way and there's 12 furlongs of open road, plus nobody around here gives a shit if the horses make a lot of noise," a jockey who only went by the name "Two-Crop" told reporters, as various riders made last-minute adjustments to their elaborately decorated, neon-painted saddles and blue LED underbody lights, with several thoroughbreds loudly neighing in anticipation of the race. "There's no fuckin' around out here. It's ten thousand cash to enter the race, winner take all. And if you lose, you might have to hand over your filly to the jockey who beat you." Just as the contestants were lining up behind the hand-drawn chalk outline of a starting gate, a number of mounted police officers descended on the scene, causing the jockeys to quickly jump on their steeds and gallop away in all different directions.
