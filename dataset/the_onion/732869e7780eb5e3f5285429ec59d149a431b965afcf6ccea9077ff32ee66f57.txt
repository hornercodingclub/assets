CLEVELAND--Admitting that the grueling three-month-long shooting schedule takes a significant mental and physical toll on all 30 teams across the country, Cleveland Cavaliers power forward LeBron James expressed his relief Tuesday at having finally finished filming the 2014-15 NBA season. "Taping all 82 regular season games and the playoffs over just 12 weeks is definitely a grind, so we're all really looking forward to some time off," said James, adding that, because games are not filmed chronologically, the Cavaliers spent over a month on location playing each of their away series before returning to Cleveland to complete the remaining half of their season. "It gets pretty tiring, especially because on Fridays we always film two home games back-to-back in order to reduce costs. That said, I don't want to reveal too much, but they just wrapped the last game of the NBA Finals last night, and I think this will go down as one of the best seasons the league has ever put out. I can't wait to see everyone's reaction when they watch it." While refusing to comment on speculation regarding specific games or series, James did hint that NBA fans will "really enjoy" the way Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant's season ends.
