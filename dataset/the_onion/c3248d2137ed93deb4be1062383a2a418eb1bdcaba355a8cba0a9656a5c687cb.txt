CUPERTINO, CA--Touting the product's new state-of-the art features and highly intuitive user interface, Apple's gag division unveiled at a media event today the iDookie 4SE, which the tech giant describes as the sleekest, most advanced fake dog shit to date. "With this newest iDookie, we have created an ultrathin pile of novelty dog shit that provides the experience of a much larger imitative turd," said Apple's senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller, referring to the 2.5-inch-thick, touch-operated piece of plastic dog feces as "a worthy addition" to Apple's line of fake barf, whoopee cushions, and Wi-Fi-compatible squirting flowers. "Users simply place the iDookie on carpets, tables, laptops, or virtually anywhere, and then stand back and watch as unsuspecting passersby react with shock and surprise to the realistic-appearing dog doo. We at Apple are very excited to see this 'must-have' product in the hands of pranksters everywhere." Schiller's announcement was met with a thunderous standing ovation from those in attendance, all of whom announced their plans to lineup at Apple Stores weeks in advance for the fake dog shit.
