INDIANAPOLIS--Scouts at the 2013 NFL Combine are reportedly abuzz over a 3-inch orange cone whose draft stock is skyrocketing after a standout performance in the first two days of the annual talent showcase. "I don't think any of us have seen a cone dominate the combine like this since at least '87," said Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman of the tough, durable SEC cone, which outshined two other highly touted pieces of plastic during the three-cone drill. "This cone is real solid. Great poise out there and just fearless in the middle of the field. Probably too small to be a pylon, but a creative franchise could find a lot of uses for that cone during training camp."At press time, sources confirmed that the cone was rolling around on the ground in pain after colliding with Florida defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd.
