AUGUSTA, GA--While warming up for the 2009 Masters Tournament, Phil Mickelson told reporters that he has come up with 'the perfect comeback' to use if Tiger Woods cracks a joke about his left-handedness. "Tiger likes to tease me, but this time I've got something ready for him--and let me tell you, it's a good one," Mickelson said during a press conference as he struggled to stop himself from laughing. "It's not corny or lowbrow or anything, either. No, I spent a lot of time thinking up the best possible zinger, and it's gonna get him right where it hurts. I bet he stops in his tracks and says, 'Ya got me.' And he'll be right, too." The exact nature and phrasing of Mickelson's comeback is not currently known.
