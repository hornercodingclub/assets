CHICAGO--Bears middle linebacker Brian Urlacher told reporters Saturday that he felt confident about being ready to sit out the team's season opener against the Colts, insisting that a sprained MCL would not prevent him from taking part in any action on the bench. "I'll be 100 percent, sitting down, checking it out from the sidelines," Urlacher said. "My goal for Sept. 9 is to be cleared for all football-watching activities, such as looking, clapping, and cheering. I can't wait to start hitting the bench. Bears fans better be prepared for some hard sitting." Despite Urlacher's enthusiasm, Bears coach Lovie Smith was reportedly pessimistic about the linebacker's chances of standing on the sidelines anytime before week six.
