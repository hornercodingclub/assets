NEW YORK--In an interview dealing with the highlights of his 18-year career, All-Star Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina seemed to believe that he has procured a World Series ring despite all evidence to the contrary."Sure I did, I helped put away the Mets back in 2000," said Mussina, who did not join the Yankees until the 2001 season. "Boy, was that a great team.Paulie [O'Neill], Tino [Martinez], [Scott] Bro[sius], and me... Ya know, I think Doc Gooden was on that team too. Just being on the field, letting that feeling of elation wash over me... That was the highlight of my career." Mussina went on to say that, to this day, he still values his Rookie of the Year award over any of his five Cy Youngs.
