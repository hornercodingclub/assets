A British auction house will sell several locks of Mick Jagger's hair, which are expected to fetch between $2,300 and $3,100, and which are said to date back to the mid-1960s, when the grandmother of a woman who was then dating the Rolling Stones frontman took some of his hair without his knowledge. What do think? "I learned a long time ago that unless you're getting the whole scalp, never pay more than $1,200 for hair." Alexander Schmidt * Linen Grader "I've got the perfect spot for it next to Jerry Garcia's finger." June Hunt * Abrasive Mixer "Damn it! I also had samples of Jagger's hair, but I stupidly mixed them in with a big bag of hair." Joe Barnathan * Film Inspector
