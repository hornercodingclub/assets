REDMOND, WA--Following Tuesday's announcement that company vice president Satya Nadella had been named Microsoft's new chief executive officer, many of the software giant's older employees reportedly reminisced about an earlier era in the tech industry's history when CEOs were so large they took up entire rooms. "When you look at our brand-new thin, mobile CEO, it's hard to even imagine that these guys were once so gigantic that a warehouse-sized space was needed to hold one of them," Microsoft senior developer Glenn Maloney told reporters, noting that despite Nadella's impressive memory capabilities and ability to engage in complex operations, there was something "kind of charming" about relying on a bulky old CEO that weighed several tons and required an extended staff of engineers to maintain. "Sure, those giant executives were a little cumbersome and a whole lot slower, but I always liked being able to walk into a climate-controlled vault and see a humming CEO crunching numbers." Maloney noted, however, that despite their difference in size and ability, tech CEOs of today were still essentially the same calculating, unfeeling machines underneath their exteriors.
