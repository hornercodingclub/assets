LOS ANGELES--Citing the freedom of the form, the popularity of shows such as and , and the likelihood that his fans would be excited to hear what he's been up to lately, former cast member Chris Kattan wondered aloud Wednesday whether he should start his own podcast. "I could call up some old friends like Darrell Hammond and Rachel Dratch--I'm sure they'd totally be into coming on as guests," Kattan said of his possible foray into podcasting, which he told reporters he envisioned as "an interview show with some comedy elements." "And I bet people would love to catch up with [Kattan's characters] Mango, Mr. Peepers, and Gay Hitler. You know, if I clear some of the boxes and other stuff out of the basement and grab that card table out of the garage, I could set up a really sweet little home studio down there." Kattan was reportedly spotted later that day pricing low-end mixing boards at a North Hollywood Guitar Center location.
