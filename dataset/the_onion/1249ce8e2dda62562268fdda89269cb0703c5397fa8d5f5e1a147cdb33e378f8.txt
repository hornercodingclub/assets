LONDON--Just two months away from Kate Middleton's speculated July due date, sources close to the Royal Family confirmed today the is in the throes of yet another case of morning sickness. "As has been the case several times in the past few months, Kate is feeling a tad queasy," an anonymous source told reporter Robin Healy. "However, when the Duchess isn't sick, she has all sorts of food cravings and will always leave the plates completely spotless. That royal baby must be a hungry little guy!" The source added that an apparently overwhelmed and excited Middleton has repeatedly told those around her that she "just [wants] the baby to come out."
