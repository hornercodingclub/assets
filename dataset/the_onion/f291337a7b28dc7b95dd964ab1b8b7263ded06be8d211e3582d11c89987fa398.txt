EUGENE, OR--According to anonymous sources, guests at the University of Oregon's Sigma Nu fraternity house Friday rejoiced when fellow party attendee Jeff Lyons unzipped a bag of shredded lettuce, expertly licked the edges of two tortillas, and rolled a couple of fat burritos to pass around. "Yo, sprinkle some cheese on that fatty and pass it this way," Lyons said before opening his mouth sharply and taking a long pull of pork. "Whoa, I got way too much that time. This one's totally cashed. Looks like we'll have to pack another bowl of meat and cheese." Lyons reportedly told partygoers that if a neighbor smells refried beans and calls the police, they should quickly stomp out the burrito and kick it under the couch.
