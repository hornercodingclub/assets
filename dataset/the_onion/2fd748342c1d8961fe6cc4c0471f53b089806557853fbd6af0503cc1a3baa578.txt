After Muslim leaders in Maryland asked their local school district to include the Muslim holy day Eid al-Adha on its official calendar and give students the day off, the county's Board of Education voted to quietly strike all other religious holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur, from the calendar. What do think? "Politely asking for inclusion is Muslim Terrorism 101." Nadia Thomas * Supply Orderer "I don't understand why Muslims just can't be happy celebrating holidays they don't really believe in like the rest of us." Greg Nelson *  Stunt Choreographer "If everyone is equally ostracized, what's the harm?" Daniel Lamb * Account Manager
