SALT LAKE CITY--Offering incredibly vague and at times conflicting attributes for the type of player they're looking to add to their roster, officials from the Utah Jazz reportedly asked the NBA league office Thursday to select a forward for them with the team's first-round pick in tomorrow's draft. "Just get the best power forward who's available--somebody tall and good on defense, I guess," Jazz general manager Dennis Lindsey was overheard telling NBA commissioner Adam Silver over the phone, repeatedly stressing that the decision "isn't really anything to worry about." "And if you don't like any of the forwards, maybe get us a center or point guard--whoever you want, really. Just do me a favor and shoot me an email afterwards to let me know who we wound up with." Lindsey added that if Silver is unable to find a jersey to hold alongside the player after announcing the pick, he can simply use a plain white T-shirt with the word "Jazz" written on it in black marker.
