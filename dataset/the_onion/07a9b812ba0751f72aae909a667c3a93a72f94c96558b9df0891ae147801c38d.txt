WASHINGTON--Praising the bold new perspective he has introduced to Congress since being sworn in last week, sources said Monday that first-term representative Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) has already brought a host of fresh roadblocks to the table. "He's coming in here with an outsider point of view and original obstacles that can help us really bring things to a standstill this session," said seven-term representative Mike Rogers (R-AL), adding that he was excited to work with someone who had not yet been worn down by years of the same tired obstructive tactics. "It's so energizing to see a fresh face in this chamber with unexpected ideas for stalling a bill in its tracks and totally out-of-the-box approaches to making the legislative branch totally ineffectual." Rogers went on to say, however, that he had seen this kind of thing before and that it was only a matter of time before his new colleague was attaching the same burdensome riders as everyone else.
