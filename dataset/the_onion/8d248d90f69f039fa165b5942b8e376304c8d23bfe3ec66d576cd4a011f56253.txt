CLARKSVILLE, TN--Explaining that people need to be critical of the news stories that circulate on social media these days, area Facebook user James Wheatley, 44, reportedly took the time to verify the truth of an article he came across Thursday by carefully checking it against the opinions he already holds. "You can't just accept everything you see online, which is why I always take a closer look at the claims that are made in every article and make sure that each one of them is backed up by my existing assumptions and personal feelings about the world," said Wheatley, who told reporters he had to correct several friends on Facebook earlier this week after an investigation of his beliefs and individual political perspectives proved the articles they had posted to be entirely false. "There are all kinds of bogus news stories out there, so it's important to take a step back and hold each article up against my personal convictions to find out for myself whether what I'm reading is true or not. It's pretty sad, but once I got in the habit of looking at articles this way, I could see just how many awful sites there are on the internet that don't even adhere to the most basic tenets of my individual worldview, so now I just disregard them completely." At press time, Wheatley was said to have shared the article he had verified this morning along with a message demanding his friends "educate [themselves] about what's really happening in the world."
