ORLANDO, FL--Saying that the offer includes all-you-can-eat portions of customers' favorite krill entrees, casual dining chain Red Lobster announced this week the return of its popular Krill Fest seasonal promotion. "Whether you're craving crunchy popcorn krill or you prefer your krill lightly sauteed, you'll find mouthwatering platters piled high with fresh, succulent krill all this month at our locations nationwide," said company president Salli Setta, noting that customers could purchase seawater-filled pails of the half-inch, heterotrophic crustaceans for $6.99, with family-size 58,000-piece vats available for $16.99. "Kick off your summer right with a Chesapeake Bay Krill Bake, Parrot Isle Coconut Krill, any of our Captain's Choice Krill Platters, Krill Linguine Alfredo, or a Krill-Plankton Combo Barrel. They're all right here at Red Lobster." Setta added that customers should hurry into participating restaurants soon as Krill Fest deals will only be available until the end of the month, at which point the promotion will be replaced by the company's annual Barnacle Bonanza.
