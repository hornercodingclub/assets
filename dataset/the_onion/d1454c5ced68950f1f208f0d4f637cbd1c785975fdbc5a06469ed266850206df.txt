ALAMO, CA--The purchase of a new leather-bound notebook is really going to help area woman Katherine Seigel realize her creative ambitions, the 34-year-old confirmed to reporters this week. "Maybe I will use it to write short stories in, or poems, or just whatever creative thoughts come into my brain," said Seigel of the black rounded-corner notebook, which she purchased for $19.50 at a local bookstore. "I can carry it everywhere in my purse and then whenever I have an idea I'll just take out my notebook and start writing in it. It's going to be great!" At press time, the notebook was sitting in a desk drawer in Seigel's apartment.
