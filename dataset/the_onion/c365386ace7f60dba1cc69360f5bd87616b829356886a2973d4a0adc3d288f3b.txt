Onion Sports' NFL Week Two Picks -- Expect Patriots receiver Julian Edelman to become Tom Brady's favorite target in an otherwise sloppy New England win, snagging 13 of the QB's 19 completions for an average of 6 yards per catch. -- After a bright start to his NFL career last week, look for rookie quarterback E.J. Manuel to notch his first win in this matchup against his future self. -- Following a blowout loss against Denver, the Ravens will be able to take absolutely no confidence from a win against the Browns. -- Chicago should easily win this game by relying on the arm of Christian Ponder. --The Chiefs will high-tail it right back into the tunnel after getting a glimpse of the Cowboys' monstrous owner. -- Another rusty performance from Robert Griffin III will really make fans wonder if perhaps he's coming off some sort of serious knee injury that he still needs time to fully recover from. -- The Titans will not only find out that Houston is a difficult place to play, but a downright awful place in general. -- For all the Ricky Williams media commotion, this game will be decided on the field, where Dungy and Manning remain a force to be reckoned with. -- Philadelphia just needs to sit back and let the Chargers do their thing. -- Quarterback Matt Ryan and the Falcons will be difficult to stop, because this is not the playoffs. -- Eye-catching performances from Carson Palmer, Calvin Johnson, and Reggie Bush will provide a perfect distraction for whatever Ndamukong Suh is going to do. -- Do they still blast cannons on that fucking pirate ship? -- In the third matchup between the Manning brothers, expect Peyton to edge out Eli by playing on the better team. -- Game will provide the Jaguars an excellent opportunity to scout out new stadiums in California. OSN does not predict games that it will be broadcasting. -- Listen, we need this one. We're in a lot of debt.
