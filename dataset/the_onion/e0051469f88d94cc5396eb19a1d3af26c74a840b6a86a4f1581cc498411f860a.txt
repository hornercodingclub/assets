Netflix announced this week that the final season of House of Cards will be refocused to feature female lead Robin Wright in the starring role, a move that comes after cutting ties with Kevin Spacey over numerous sexual assault allegations. What do think? "I'm so glad Netflix made the right choice and decided to keep milking its cash cow for one more season." Michael DuBois * Stamp Reinker "Kevin Spacey has always been willing to go the extra mile to get better roles for women in Hollywood." Matt Schiff * Systems Analyst "I doubt she can bring the same intensity to the role of Frank Underwood." Cecily Samereh * Moose Hunter
