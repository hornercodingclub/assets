BURBANK, CA--Insisting that such a film must not go under-gaffed, producers of the Warner Bros. comedy-horror film reportedly coaxed Brett Atkins, the film industry's most legendary gaffer, out of retirement this week at a cost rumored to be in the $50 million range. "Yes, roughly 90 percent of the film's budget will go to gaffing, but Brett brings a level of lighting expertise and cable-laying innovation that is simply indispensable," said executive producer Todd Wainwright, extolling Atkins' "revolutionary" electrical work on 1994's . "We certainly don't want another fiasco--$200 million of top-notch action spectacle, but Christ in heaven, the gaffing!" Offsetting the substantial expense, noted Wainwright, is the fact that this genre of film essentially key-grips itself.
