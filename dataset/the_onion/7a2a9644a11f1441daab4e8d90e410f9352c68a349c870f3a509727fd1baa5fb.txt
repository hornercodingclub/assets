BRISTOL, CT--It remains unclear whether ESPN college football analyst Lou Holtz went on a lengthy, bigoted tangent against Muslims during an on-air segment, sources at the network reported earlier today. "From what I could tell, he either said something derogatory about Muslims or just told me how much he likes roast beef," said fellow analyst Mark May, who noted that Holtz kept spitting--apparently out of anger--throughout the incomprehensible diatribe. "The whole thing sounded like a mish-mash of anti-Islamic rhetoric along with a list of European cities or something about his ankles, though it was all admittedly pretty hard to discern. Whatever it was, I was offended." Following his possible tirade, Holtz reportedly glared at the camera for several seconds until the video feed cut back to May.
