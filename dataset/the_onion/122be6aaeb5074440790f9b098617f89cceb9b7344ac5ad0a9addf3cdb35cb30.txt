WASHINGTON, DC--Mere moments after their gutsy and much-needed last-minute win over the Redskins Sunday, Giants players and coaches found themselves depressed, despondent, and driven to the brink of giving up at the outcome. "There were times during tonight's game when I really didn't think we could do it," said receiver Plaxico Burress, who was rewarded for his brilliant game-saving last-minute 33-yard touchdown catch and run with a congratulatory chewing-out by Tom Coughlin in front of the entire team. "And you know what? Even though we won, I still don't think we can do it. Coach is right--we're a bunch of losers who just don't have what it takes." Coughlin said he was "disgusted and satisfied" with the team's utter lack of motivation and confidence and says he plans to have morale completely destroyed in time to miss the playoffs.
