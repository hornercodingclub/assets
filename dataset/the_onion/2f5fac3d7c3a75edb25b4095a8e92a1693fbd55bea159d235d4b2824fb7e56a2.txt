SEATTLE--In order to avoid capture by the visiting Minnesota Twins Thursday, Mariners center fielder Franklin Gutierrez bit down on his team-issued cyanide capsule during a run down between second and third base. "When you're surrounded by defenders on both sides with no escape in sight, team protocol is to self-terminate," said Mariners third base coach Jeff Datz, adding that running outside the baseline is never an option. "Frankie conducted himself bravely. He attempted to advance to the far base, turned back to see if the near base was attainable, assessed the situation, and realized he was out of options. That's when I smelled the bitter almonds and I knew he was gone." When asked what information Gutierrez possessed that made suicide his only option, Datz chuckled humorlessly and lit a cigarette, saying, "There's a lot you don't know about the Seattle Mariners."
