After a Georgia woman came forward and claimed she had a 13-year affair with Herman Cain, the former Godfather's Pizza CEO announced he would suspend his campaign for the presidency. What do think? "That's too bad. He was a serious contender to be president of the United States." Josh Jones * Revenue Agent "If Herman Cain's entire presidential campaign was engineered solely as an elaborate ruse for a business executive to scapegoat the news media for his serial marital infidelities, I say, brilliant, brilliant work, sir." Kenneth Guy * Machine Burrer "Wow. It takes a special kind of extramarital affair to break up a run for president. She must really be something else." Denise Sugarman * Counseling Psychologist
