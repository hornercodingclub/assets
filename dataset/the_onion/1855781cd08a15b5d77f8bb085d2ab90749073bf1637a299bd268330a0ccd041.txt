For the seventh time in 12 years, Mark David Chapman, the man who shot John Lennon dead outside the music legend's New York City apartment building in 1980, was denied parole by the New York Department of Corrections. What do think? "Gosh, those corrections officers must really have something against murderers." Saul Petzoldt * Test Baker "I think if John Lennon were alive today, he'd say they should let Chapman go free. But that would mean he would never have been murdered in the first place, so you see how complicated it gets when you're dealing with time travel." Carrie Ramos * Systems Analyst "He'd be free by now if he'd taken out Ringo." Curt Fey * Musical String Maker
