CHICAGO--Explaining that the sense of unease she felt walking to and from her home had declined markedly over the years, Humboldt Park resident Kirsten Healy expressed her disappointment to reporters Thursday that her neighborhood was becoming too safe for her family to afford. "When we first moved in seven years ago, we didn't even feel like we could leave the house after dark, which was great for a family on a limited budget," said Healy, who noted that, given how little she lies awake these days worrying about a potential home invasion or assault, she can tell her family will soon be priced out of their apartment. "The way things are going, we won't even feel unsafe walking the few blocks to the grocery store in a year or two--I just don't think we have the kind of money for that. We'd love to stay here, but with our finances the way they are, the minute we stop needing the second bolt on the back door we'll have no choice but to go out looking for a neighborhood that's more terrifying." At press time, the Healys breathed sighs of relief after hearing about a shooting that occurred just five blocks away.
