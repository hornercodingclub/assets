NEW YORK--Seemingly staring into the depths of the very future itself, prophetic CBS college basketball analyst Verne Lundquist reportedly harnessed an unfathomable power Thursday, providing a glimpse of the NCAA Tournament's fate by foretelling "there are bound to be some upsets this year." "There's always upsets in the first round; you never know who or when, but they'll happen," said Lundquist, humbly brushing aside his immaculate power of premonition or perhaps delivering yet another thinly veiled riddle of a prophecy that the only certainty of March Madness is its uncertainty. "It seems every year a 12 beats a 5, and I wouldn't expect this year to be any different." Conjuring visions of the most stunning surprises that await us all, the miraculous soothsayer boldly prophesied that this year's national championship will be won by the No. 1 overall seed.
