OSN shares its expert analysis on the teams that will come away with victory in this weekend's NFL week 10 games: - If the Redskins were to lose this game 34-27, it would be time to start pointing fingers, but that's a big if. - The Bills find themselves in the middle of yet another NFL season. - The Bengals are really going to miss having Geno Atkins' massive body while piling on top of Joe Flacco. - Do not go to this game. The Bears will win, but we saw something else in the prediction. Something in the crowd. There's no time to explain. Just get as far away from Chicago as possible. - The Philadelphia secondary is going to be constantly frustrated by Packers quarterback Seneca Wallace, who will not throw passes far enough for interceptions. - The Rams are used to playing in a dome, but not in a loud dome. - The Jaguars are the team to beat this season. - Coming off back-to-back wins over two shitty teams, the Giants will continue their pathetic little resurgence with another hollow victory over the Raiders. - Falcons quarterback gets Roddy White back this week, providing the play caller with another dejected face in the huddle. - All it takes is one questionable call, an uncontrollable fit of rage, and that vein popping out of Jim Harbaugh's forehead bursts, instantaneously killing the coach. - Interim head coach Jack Del Rio will have to prove he is capable of nodding along to whatever Peyton Manning says. - If the season ended today we wouldn't have to watch this game. - Drew Brees and the Saints must put last week's loss to the Jets out of their minds and focus on the Jets' imminent collapse during the second half of the season. - Could the Richie Incognito-Jonathan Martin story play some part in ESPN's pregame buildup to this Monday Night Football game? It's still unclear, but Onion Sports is going out on a limb and predicting it will.
