CINCINNATI--Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis was immediately placed on suicide watch by city authorities after achieving his franchise-record 65th victory with the team last Sunday. "The fact that he's tallied 65 wins with the Bengals means he's been miserable for a long time, and in enough pain to plunge any person into a deep, suicidal depression," Cincinnati police chief Daryl Rowan told reporters during a press conference, adding that the majority of suicides in Cincinnati can be linked back to the victim's association with the Bengals. "Lewis has been put through so much turmoil--from Mike Brown's terrible decisions to Cedric Benson's multiple arrests to last year's 4-12 season to having to deal with Carson Palmer for so damn long. After all that, it's a shock he isn't hanging from a ceiling beam somewhere already." Moments after the press conference, Police Chief Rowan was found dead and, in a suicide note, claimed that discussing the Bengals that long had been too much for him to handle.
