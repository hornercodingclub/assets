CUPERTINO, CA--Bringing to an end weeks of fevered anticipation, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced plans Monday to sell a Power Mac G4 for $120 that can still run Photoshop CS without a hitch. "Today, Apple is proud to announce the sale of a really phenomenal personal computer featuring a 350 MHz processor, 64 MB of ram, and a fully functioning zip drive bay--all for only $120," said Cook, adding that Apple would listen to any other competitive offers for the 2002 desktop, which comes in a sleek Graphite case with only a few cosmetic nicks and scratches. "You can even use QuarkXPress for doing print layouts, if that's something you need. Sure, it takes a few extra minutes to boot up and you aren't going to be running the latest and greatest software, but once you get up and running, you won't even care. Especially when you hear the sound coming out of the built-in mono speaker. Did I mention it comes bundled with an optical mouse?" Cook concluded by adding that interested parties could contact him personally at with a subject line mentioning the Power Mac G4.
