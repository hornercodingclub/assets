It's a fine day in Activeville! Everyone is hustling and bustling around, looking as if they have things to do! But you know what? They actually don't! Once upon a time, years and years ago, the citizens of Activeville did have many, many things to do--back when Activeville was the #1 manufacturer of chemically synthesized dyes and machine-tooled industrial parts in all of Happyland. But times changed, and the things the citizens of Activeville did to stay busy moved to other places like Pickletown and Peppermint City. Sometimes these things traveled far, far away from Happyland itself, to places where people speak other languages and did not need to be paid nearly as much. Now, just about all the people of Activeville can do is drink coffee, shop and earn liberal-arts degrees! Do you live in a place like Activeville, too? Look at these page and see how many things you recognize!
