LOS ANGELES--Following last Sunday's midseason finale, creator and showrunner Vince Gilligan told reporters that in a departure from the "light, fun tone" that has characterized the program thus far, the concluding episodes may take more of a darker turn. "Ever since the very first episode, in which [main character] Walt is diagnosed with cancer and forced to sell meth to provide for his pregnant wife and cerebral-palsy-stricken son, I've thought that perhaps one day we could begin taking the show in a grittier direction," said Gilligan, adding that while the program's ongoing depiction of a man slowly succumbing to an illegal lifestyle defined by power, violence, and alienation was fine for four and a half seasons, he "wouldn't mind" eventually exploring some grimmer themes. "I know our audience has gotten comfortable seeing Walt regularly kill drug dealers, endanger his family, and poison small children, but, personally, I think people would be interested in seeing a slightly more sinister side to the character." Gilligan's announcement comes just weeks after fellow AMC showrunner Matthew Weiner announced it was "entirely conceivable that the next season of may touch on how men deal with marriage."
