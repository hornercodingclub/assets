Former classmates of Mitt Romney have reported multiple incidents of bullying by the presidential candidate when he was a student at the prestigious Cranbrook preparatory school in Michigan. What do think? "I don't get why everyone always says that Romney has no personality when he's very clearly an asshole." Henry Partain * Systems Analyst "I'm not sure 'bully' is the right word, but it's pretty damn forward to dedicate a chunk of your life to wheedling strangers into worshipping your god." Gayle Hardesty * Antiques Restorer "There's only one way to find out. Put my shy kid with a lisp in front of him and see if he can keep his slapping hands to himself." Thomas Vail * Mill Attendant
