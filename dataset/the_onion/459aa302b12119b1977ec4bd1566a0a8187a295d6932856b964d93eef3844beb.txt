ASHBURN, VA--Discouraged by player performance during workouts, drills, meetings, and stretching exercises, head coach Mike Shanahan canceled the Redskins' remaining 2010-2011 practices Wednesday, conceding that no amount of training could possibly improve the team. "I'm just wasting their time and mine by making them show up," Shanahan told reporters Wednesday. "It's important to know your players' limitations and realize that nobody is going to learn the playbook, pay attention to basic instructions, or avoid injuries when putting on their pads. We're done." Shanahan reportedly came to his decision after witnessing an exhausted Redskins player decide to do the rest of a sit-up later.
