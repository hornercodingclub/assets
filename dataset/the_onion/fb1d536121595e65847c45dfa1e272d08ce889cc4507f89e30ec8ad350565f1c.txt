PARADISE, NV--Interrupted by an aide to the Republican nominee who strode up to his table during the third presidential debate Wednesday, moderator Chris Wallace is said to have received a cease-and-desist letter from the Trump Organization in the middle of asking Donald Trump to respond to allegations that he groped multiple women. "Are you Chris Wallace? This is for you," said the Trump Organization representative, handing the Fox News host a letter from Trump's lawyer Marc Kasowitz, which threatened legal action over "reckless, slanderous, and defamatory statements made by Chris Wallace at the presidential debate on October 19, 2016," and stated that "the timing of these statements moments ago during a nationally televised broadcast makes it clear that this is a politically motivated attempt to harm Mr. Trump's candidacy." "If you fail to comply with this order, Mr. Wallace, we'll have no choice but to sue. Good day." The Trump Organization official reportedly rushed back onstage moments later after Wallace asked the GOP nominee how much federal income tax he has paid over the past 20 years, serving the moderator a restraining order that barred him from having any contact with Trump for the remainder of the debate.
