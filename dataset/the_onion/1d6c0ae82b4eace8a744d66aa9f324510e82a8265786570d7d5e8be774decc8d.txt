REDDING, CA--Noting that his practice's rating on the business review website had dipped to just 3.5 stars, local primary care provider Dr. Frank Hawley reportedly dashed off several Adderall prescriptions Monday to give his Yelp average a needed boost. "I keep a pretty close eye on my reviews, and whenever I see my number fall below four stars I just write out a few extra Adderall or Dexedrine scripts and it's back up in no time," said Hawley, adding that he usually ups the dosage to 30 milligrams and makes sure to prescribe two refills to ensure he stays near the top of the local general practice rankings. "Patients are always happy when I sign that prescription slip and hand it to them--it's pretty much a guaranteed five-star rating. In a business that survives by word of mouth, good reviews are absolutely essential." In addition, Hawley confirmed he hasn't advised a single patient to exercise regularly or maintain a healthy diet since 2011, saying he learned his lesson after receiving a devastating one-star review.
