NEW YORK--Saying they are beginning to perceive the full scope of the secretive business dealings, investigators working for special counsel Robert Mueller announced Friday that subpoenaed Trump Organization financial records show the company's only discrete holding is a Dairy Queen franchise in West Milford, NJ. "We are currently engaged in a thorough analysis of financial statements, relinquished in response to the subpoena, encompassing the entire Trump Organization's business empire, namely the Dairy Queen just down Marshall Hill Road from the paintball supply shop," said agent Maria Russo, explaining that the last 30 years of President Trump's business career appear to have been spent running the franchise, and that all his investments, accrued debt, and total net worth are tied up in the ownership of the suburban ice cream stand. "As we understand it so far, the day-to-day work of all 20,000 Trump employees worldwide, including the thousands working at the company's rented headquarters in Trump Tower, is singularly devoted to the management and promotion of this Dairy Queen franchise. We are also in possession of tax records indicating Trump did briefly own a minor share of a Pizza Hut on Long Island, but it apparently went bankrupt in 1997." Russo also said that the investigation had not yet turned up definitive links to Russian money, but noted the job description for the Dairy Queen night manager included "at least three 'ruble runs' a week" to the currency exchange at the Newark Airport.
