NEW YORK--The NBA honored Hornets point guard Chris Paul Wednesday for heroically stepping in front of a stray pass and saving the basketball from going out of bounds. "Chris deserves to be commended for his selfless act, as many players would have just stood and watched while the out-of-control ball flew helplessly into the stands," league commissioner David Stern said while presenting Paul with the NBA Medal of Valor, basketball's second-highest civilian honor, for his bravery during the Apr. 8 game against the Phoenix Suns."I don't even want to think about what would have happened if Chris wasn't there. But thankfully he was, and he prevented the tragic loss of a key possession late in the game." Paul said that he has not seen or talked with the ball since saving it from going out of bounds.
