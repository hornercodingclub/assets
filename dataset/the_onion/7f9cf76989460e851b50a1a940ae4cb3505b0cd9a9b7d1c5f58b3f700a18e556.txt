--Following a recent statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics touting the benefits of circumcision, the nation's creepy middle school gym teachers have also announced their support for the procedure, declaring it the more hygienic and aesthetically preferable alternative. "We just want to see healthy, happy boys out there, unencumbered by unsightly folds of loose foreskin," creepy middle school gym teacher spokesman Mr. Griffon said at a press conference Wednesday, stressing that his group did not dislike uncircumcised penises per se, but simply found them less than ideal. "No boy should have to go through life with a disease-ridden flap of skin obscuring the elegant curve of his glans." The group also decried the growing childhood obesity epidemic, due to its reported deleterious effects on student health and the firmness of pubescent breasts.
