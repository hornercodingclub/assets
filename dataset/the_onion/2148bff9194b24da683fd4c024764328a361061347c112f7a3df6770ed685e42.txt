CHICAGO--Close friends and family confirmed Tuesday that Bulls point guard Derrick Rose has remained completely silent for the past 17 days, failing to utter one word since learning that the torn meniscus in his right knee will cause him to miss a second consecutive season. "Derrick just sits there; he hasn't even moved," said a friend who wished to remain anonymous, adding that the three-time All-Star spends most of the day on the couch staring at the ceiling. "Yesterday he inhaled deeply like he was about to say something, but then he just sighed and changed the TV channel he was watching." Rose's mother, Brenda, reportedly visited over the weekend and told her pajama-wearing son to remain positive in the face of adversity--an encouragement sources said the 2011 NBA MVP responded to with a shrug.
