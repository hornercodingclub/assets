After concealing the cast from fans, director J.J. Abrams finally announced this week that Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher will be returning for the new film in their roles as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia. What do think? "Harrison Ford will always be Tommy Lillard from to me." Calvin Jacobson * Sidewalk Hoser "Judging by the returning cast, it's safe to assume the movie takes place 30 long, harrowing years after ." Marcia Ellsbury * Systems Analyst "It's nice to know I'm not the only one who should've outgrown these characters 30 years ago." Jack Hargrove * Cream Cheese Spreader
