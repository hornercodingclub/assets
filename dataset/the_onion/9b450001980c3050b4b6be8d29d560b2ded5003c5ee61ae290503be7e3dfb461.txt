SALT LAKE CITY--Following the formal public announcement that he was no longer invited to the annual Conservative Public Action Conference, Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) reportedly screamed, "I'll show those pricks!" Thursday while driving a busload of pregnant women to an abortion clinic. "They called me liberal, I'll show them liberal--did you hear that, ladies, we're all getting abortions!" shouted Romney, who shifted the bus carrying 48 women into high gear before careening wildly into the clinic's lot and parking the vehicle diagonally across multiple spaces. "Out, out, everybody out! Sheila, Jen, hush that crying. I don't care what term you're on, I've got a score to settle. Did you hear what those assholes did to me? Get whatever you want back there because everything's on me!" At press time, Romney had driven the bus to a nearby obstretician's office and was waving a fistful of cash in the waiting room, offering $5,000 to anyone who would get an abortion.
