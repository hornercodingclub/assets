PITTSBURGH--After preventing likely Obama supporter Carmen Ruiz from registering to vote on Monday, elections officer Donald Tobin admitted that he doubts the vote he suppressed would actually have made a difference come Election Day. "Obama's going to win here no matter who I disenfranchise, so what's the point?" said Tobin, adding that if he lived in a true swing state like Florida or Ohio, his vote suppression might actually count for something. "Honestly, what's it say about our when, even if I exercise my right to turn an elderly or enfeebled U.S. citizen away because he doesn't have a driver's license, it basically means nothing. That's not democracy." Though he was clearly disappointed, Tobin decided he would place an "I Suppressed a Vote Today" sticker on his jacket collar, anyway.
