After being threatened by a hacker who had stolen the audio files, Radiohead has released 18 hours of demos documenting the creation of classic album in support of the climate fund Extinction Rebellion. What do you think? "My one complaint about h as always been that it's not 17 hours and seven minutes longer." Marvin Bentley * Griddle Technician "Once A&R reps hear these demos, it's only a matter of time before labels come calling." Jermaine King * Eel Advocate "I'm a little conflicted here because I love Radiohead, but I'm actually in favor of climate change." Patty Shannon * Lantern Artisan
