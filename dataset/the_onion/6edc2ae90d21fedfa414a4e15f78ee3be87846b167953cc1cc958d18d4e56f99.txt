PEBBLE BEACH, CA--In an effort to show appreciation for his Father's Day gift, Phil Mickelson, participating in the final round of the U.S. Open Sunday, reluctantly used a pitching wedge his three children created from a cardboard tube, construction paper, a shoe box, and masking tape. "Oh, boy. I'm never going to get all the glitter out of my golf bag," Mickelson was overheard saying as he stared down a 135-yard shot to the No. 1 green, his children eagerly looking on. "This is going to be a long day." Mickelson then examined the pitching wedge's yarn grip and the grooves drawn on the clubface in magic marker, sighed, set up to the ball, and proceeded to make a 47 on the hole.
