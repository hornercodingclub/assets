Nestle is voluntarily recalling two varieties of its popular Hot Pockets microwaveable turnovers, "Philly Steak and Cheese" and "Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese," because they may contain meat from "diseased and unsound" animals. What do think? "I wasn't surprised to hear this about the Philly Steak and Cheese Hot Pocket--but the Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese Hot Pocket, too?" Martin Conwill * Gene Sequencer "I guess their standards for Hot Pockets are a lot higher than mine." David Arrowood * Bread Baker "But will they still be selling some of the borderline ones in a bargain bin?" Carrie Abaya * Bead Store Owner
