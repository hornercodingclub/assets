WASHINGTON--As cameras snapped and members of the press looked on, neither President Obama nor members of the Tennessee Titans were able to provide any indication as to why the professional football team might have been invited to visit the White House Tuesday. "We are honored to have this team here today," said Obama, who paused to confer privately with an aide after appearing confused by the appearance in the Oval Office of the NFL's 27th-ranked team. "It's good to see you. God bless America." Following the exchange, the befuddled Titans handed the president a jersey, posed for more pictures, and flew back to Nashville in confused silence.
