CHICAGO--Fifteen-year veteran NHL official Michael Lussenhop confirmed in an interview Sunday that the most satisfying part of his job is when he's backed into a corner and has to grab the boards to leap over the puck to keep from interfering with the game. "Compared with the typical routine of just skating around, it's a nice little treat," said Lussenhop, who added that he never makes the hop too fancy, but simply makes sure he "gets over the puck and lands safely." "The other refs always bust my chops afterward: 'Hey, saw you got to jump over the puck today.' It's all in good fun. We have a good time." Lussenhop went on to explain that every ref's second favorite part of the job is getting to put the goal back into place when it comes loose, while their least favorite is dropping the puck during "stupid, boring face-offs."
