DOYLESTOWN, PA--Suddenly struck by inspiration as he listened to the legendary German composer's seminal masterpiece, local man Ben Hastings reported Monday that hearing Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony had given him the idea to become a genius of some sort. "A few minutes into listening to that thing and it just hit me: should become a peerless virtuoso whose transcendent contributions to my field leave an indelible mark on history," said the 34-year-old, who after taking in the fourth movement of what is considered by many to be the greatest work in the Western classical music canon reportedly came to the conclusion that he too should make some kind of timeless work of art or scientific breakthrough that will be revered and studied for generations. "Beethoven's symphony really opened me up to the idea of being a world-renowned genius. I think that creating something so visionary that it becomes an inextricable part of human culture while placing me in the pantheon of cultural luminaries from Leonardo da Vinci to Steve Jobs could definitely be my thing, but pioneering a new, groundbreaking school of thought would be pretty awesome, too. Maybe I could revolutionize sculpture or physics or something." After learning from his Wikipedia page that Beethoven started losing his hearing at age 28, Hastings reportedly came up with a plan to also overcome something.
