SEAFORD, DE--Disregarding the fact that the novel has nothing to do with Harry Potter or wizardry, local man Quincy Basset, 33, announced his plan to line up for the release of J.K. Rowling's dressed as Severus Snape anyway. "Fuck it, I don't care if he's not in the book," said Basset, donning his long robes, $200 potion master jacket, and flowing jet black wig as he has for the releases of the past three Harry Potter books, and all eight films. "Look, it's a book release, J.K. Rowling wrote the book, and I've got a Snape outfit. So I'm just going to go for it." At press time, Basset was waiting in line at his local Barnes and Noble alongside dozens of fans dressed up as the middle-class English teachers, doctors, and shopkeeper characters featured in Rowling's new book.
