CHICAGO--Introducing Vinnie Del Negro as a "great guy who has just hit a rough patch and needs somewhere to stay," Bulls GM John Paxson introduced his team to their new head coach on Wednesday. "I want everyone to extend Vinnie every courtesy while he implements his offense and tries to get his life back together," Paxson told his team in the somewhat tense United Center meeting. "Look, you know how it is. You've been there. You lost 49 games last season, so don't judge. Just help him out. Let him sleep on the couch, and when he needs to talk about it, listen." An embarrassed Del Negro thanked the team for taking him in, and promised he would stay out of their way and move on again as soon as he felt he was ready.
