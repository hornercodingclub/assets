RALEIGH, NC--With a succession of quick baskets during the NCAA Tournament Friday, sources confirmed that a surge was quickly answered by a rally. "They've certainly responded with this late push," said CBS commentator Jim Nantz, adding that players had suddenly found a spark after their opponent's unanswered run just minutes earlier. "This flurry of offense is exactly what they needed. We'll just have to see if they can stem the tide here down the stretch." At press time, the other team had subsequently caught fire and stormed ahead.
