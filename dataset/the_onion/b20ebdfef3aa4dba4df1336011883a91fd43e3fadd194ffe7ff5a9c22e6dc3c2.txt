LONDON--Just hours after the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a healthy , a source close to the Royal Family reported today that the newborn heir to the British throne has his father's eyes. "I saw His young Highness earlier today, and I can tell you that he definitely has Prince William's famous baby blues," the anonymous source told after reportedly viewing the royal baby during a feeding at Buckingham Palace. "He also has his father's ears and jaw, and his grandfather Prince Charles' nose. And he has a full head of dark hair that looks just like his mother's." The source stated that the energetic infant prince spent much of the afternoon delightedly playing with his father's hands.
