NASHVILLE, TN--After enduring six straight losses and suffering through a humiliating 59-0 thrashing by the Patriots last Sunday, despondent Titans fans told reporters Wednesday that they were looking forward to enjoying a nice, relaxing bye week. "We're all hurting pretty bad, so this couldn't have come at a better time," Titans season-ticket holder Luther Murphy said. "Hopefully the week off will give us a chance to recharge, heal our wounds, and come back stronger than ever. Ah, who the fuck am I kidding? We suck." Though a majority of Titans fans said they wouldn't think or look at a football during their off week, some said they looked forward to spending their Sunday enjoying NFL football for the first time this year.
