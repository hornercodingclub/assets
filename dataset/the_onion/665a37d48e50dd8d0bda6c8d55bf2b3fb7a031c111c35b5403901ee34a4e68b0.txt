WASHINGTON--With several tears streaming down his face as he stood alone in his bedroom's walk-in closet, sources confirmed Wednesday that former Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III slipped on the suit he wore to the 2012 NFL Draft. "I'm so excited for the opportunity to finally play in the NFL and show what I can do," said Griffin, who quietly sniffled while smiling and shaking an invisible hand presumably belonging to league commissioner Roger Goodell. "I know I have a lot to prove, and it won't be easy, but my goal is to be the best quarterback in the league. I can't wait to get started in Washington--this is a dream come true." At press time, a look of pure contentment came over Griffin's face after he put on a Redskins hat, shut his eyes, and held up an old practice jersey with both hands.
