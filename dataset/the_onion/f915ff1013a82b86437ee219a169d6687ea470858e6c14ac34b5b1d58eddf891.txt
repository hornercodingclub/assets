CINCINNATI--Bengals wide receivers Chad Ochocinco and Terrell Owens reportedly stayed late after practice Tuesday to begin writing the libretto and music for, and start preliminary blocking on, a new touchdown-celebration opera. "Me and T.O. have both been working really hard on these tight arias that really capture the awesome feeling of scoring a touchdown," said Ochocinco, attaching a Phantom Of The Opera mask to his helmet. "And the Italian lyrics sound so romantic and kind of sexy, not like that German stuff. The good thing about T.O. is that he sings in this rich, full baritone, but he can also go up into head voice and sing in this sweet-ass falsetto. It's good shit." Owens, who is currently attempting to secure a block of seats near the end zone for the orchestra, said the touchdown-celebration opera would be two hours and 30 minutes in length, with one short intermission to allow for costume changes.
