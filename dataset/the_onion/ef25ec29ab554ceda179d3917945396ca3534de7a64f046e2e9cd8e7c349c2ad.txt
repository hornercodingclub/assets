ST. LOUIS--In the wake of his MVP performance in the World Series, St. Louis Cardinals third baseman David Freese has been constantly surrounded this week by dozens of swooning, average-looking women. "It's flattering to see so many plain women flocking to me, especially considering most of them look like they've probably popped out a couple kids and had to hire a babysitter in order to come out," Freese said as one woman, who wasn't exactly homely but certainly would never be described as attractive, planted a kiss right on his cheek. "My girlfriend was a little worried about all the attention I was getting at first, but then, you know, just get a load of all these fives. She's got nothing to worry about." Freese did admit it was better to be surrounded by legions of so-so women than the creepy, aging men carrying microphones who kept hounding him in the immediate aftermath of Game 7.
