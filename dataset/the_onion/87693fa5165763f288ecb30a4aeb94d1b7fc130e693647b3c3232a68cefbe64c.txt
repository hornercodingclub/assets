MIAMI--Quarterback Alex Smith's meeting with the Miami Dolphins on Sunday was unproductive, sources confirmed, because team executives were on the verge of tears and unable to talk about anything except all the other free agents who have turned them down so far this offseason. "It's bad enough that Peyton has his family here and would barely consider us, but Matt Flynn turned us down and now we're going to have to sign David Garrard, of all people," Dolphins general manager Jeff Ireland reportedly told Smith, sinking his face into his hands and wondering aloud how any team could make the region's beaches an unattractive place to live. "God, I hate the way people treat us like we don't even exist." Smith re-signed with the 49ers Tuesday in a deal said to be worth $8 million annually.
