MIAMI--In what analysts are calling a brash move, the Miami Dolphins have decided to tempt fate by going ahead and securing rooms in a Dallas Marriott for their week 12 matchup against the Cowboys. "It's pure arrogance that would lead a team to reserve rooms in Dallas when there's no guarantee they'll even be playing by then," NFL Network host Rich Eisen said Saturday on NFL Total Access, adding that the Dolphins' decision to plan that far in advance is both "cocky" and "a total gamble." "Sure, on paper, the Fins have a chance to make it past the Giants and maybe even Kansas City, but why tempt fate like this? This team has to take it a game at a time." Dolphins head coach Tony Sparano informed reporters he has booked his room in a long-stay hotel, as he is not planning on going back to Miami ever again.
