NEW ORLEANS--Following the Eagles NFC divisional playoff victory over the Giants, Archie Manning, retired NFL player and father of Peyton and Eli Manning, stunned the football world by announcing Monday that Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb is also his son. "While traveling with the Saints I met a very special woman in Chicago, and from our brief but heated union sprang a boy--a boy who naturally grew to play quarterback," Manning said during an impromptu interview, adding that he recognized the boy's mother from a recent Campbell's Chunky Soup commercial. "I've kept it a secret all this time, but when my long-lost son defeated Eli last week, I couldn't hold my fatherly pride back any longer. I'm certain Atticus McNabb Manning--the man you all know as Donovan--will bring another Super Bowl MVP Award to the Manning house." Manning admitted it would be "extremely difficult" to choose which quarterbacking son he would root for in the upcoming Ravens-Steelers AFC Championship Game.
