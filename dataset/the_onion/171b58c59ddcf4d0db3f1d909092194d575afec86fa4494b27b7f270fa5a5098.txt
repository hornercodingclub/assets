Starbucks is reportedly introducing coffee trucks to colleges around the country that can move around to highly trafficked areas of campus throughout the day to attract students. What do think? "Will there be room inside the truck for anyone to sit in front of a laptop computer and tangled mass of cords for hours on end?" Carl Steedman * Parade Coordinator "I would've loved this when I was in school; the only place you could even find a cup of coffee was at this completely immobile shop right in the center of campus." Marina Trujillo * Pedestrian Advocate "I don't know, it sounds a little crazy. Ah, hell, screw it, that's what college is all about!" Greg Bloch * Locksmith Trainer
