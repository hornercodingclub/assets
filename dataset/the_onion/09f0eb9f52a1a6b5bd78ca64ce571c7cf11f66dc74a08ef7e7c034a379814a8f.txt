Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before Congress today about last year's attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and several others dead, an assault that many Republicans contend was intentionally covered up. What do think? "If there's such a big cover-up, how come I've heard of this?" Charles Baum * Sponge Packer "Hillary Clinton must be held accountable if there is to be justice for Chris Stevens and those other two or three guys." Harley Casper * Malt Roaster "Clinton just needs to be straight with the American people and tell us exactly what happened. Unless they really screwed up--then it'd probably be best if she just made something up." Robin Shouse * Systems Analyst
