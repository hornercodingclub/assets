News sites Gothamist and DNAinfo were abruptly shut down by billionaire owner Joe Ricketts this week, shortly after their New York staffs voted to unionize. What do think? "I can't understand why employees wanted to unionize when the owner of the company seems so fair and level-headed." Lydia Erbentraut * Stevedore "On the upside, the sites have been much easier to navigate since deleting literally all of their content." Joe Neuringer * Trust Fall Coordinator "It's good to know the labor movement can still win big victories that last a few minutes before everything gets much worse." Sam Price * Popcorn Butterer
