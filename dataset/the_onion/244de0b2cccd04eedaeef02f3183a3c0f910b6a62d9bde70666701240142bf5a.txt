WASHINGTON--Several weeks after discovering unusual fissures on the lunar surface, astronomers confirmed today that the fracturing of the moon had begun to rapidly accelerate. "Cracks in the lunar mantle between craters Tycho and Stevinus have spread and deepened considerably since first detection," said NASA researcher Marc Robinson, adding that a viscous liquid substance had been observed seeping out from the moon's core. "It appears as if something is almost purposefully tearing through the layers of rock from the inside." At press time, the hatchling had sunk its talons into the Earth and flown off.
