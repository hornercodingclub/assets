CHICAGO--Saying it was by far the strongest predictor of high workplace morale, a new report released Thursday by researchers at the University of Chicago found that employees in the United States are most engaged at their jobs while working as the frontman of rock band Styx. "Whether they're belting out power ballads like 'Come Sail Away' or straight-ahead guitar-driven hits like 'Renegade,' our findings consistently show that being the frontman of Styx is the most important factor in determining whether employees are fully invested in their jobs," said lead author Ryan Sexton, whose research found that, across all demographic categories, workers were much more likely to put in extra hours and come in on weekends when they were traveling on a 26-stop cross-country United We Rock tour with REO Speedwagon. "Our data clearly indicates that employees are never more motivated than when donning a robot mask and performing 'Mr. Roboto' for a stadium of screaming fans as part of the Kilroy Was Here rock opera. They were also much more likely to take on additional synthesizer responsibilities of their own initiative." Despite their robust levels of engagement, the report also found that workers employed as the frontman of Styx did not remain with the band throughout their career and were in fact laid off and replaced after a little more than a decade.
