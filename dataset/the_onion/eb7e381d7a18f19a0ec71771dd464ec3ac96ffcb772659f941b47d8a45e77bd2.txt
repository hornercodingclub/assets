BE IT KNOWN that ALEXANDER HAMILTON, once a serveant to the American People in the halls of CONGRESS and now practicing law in the State of New York, has challenged the Populace of the very Nation he once serv'd as Leader, to a Duel. Owing to these many AFFRONTS by these same Citizens regarding: The manner in which he comports himself in affairs of business and finances; His insistence that the Artickles of Confederation be not the Ideal Rules of Governance; And on the quality of company which he keeps with man-folk--M. HAMILTON will have satisfaction at sun-up, a week hence, with Himself as Insulted Partie choosing the Weapon'ry. Thus M. HAMILTON Vowes: To best every inhabitant of these thirteen States and restore his Honneur. At SUN-UP, the one-and-a-half millions of men of shooting age must arive up'n the western bank of the Hudson River in Weehawken, armed with such pistols or rapiers as M. HAMILTON sees fit to specify, and accompanied by a second. As is the custom, a count of three shall be given, and the parties shall turn and fyre, either to wound or to kill. Should any of his country-men fail to appear, M. HAMILTON will presume they are COWARDS not worthie of his attention and shall be declared their better. With his victory in tow, he shall retire to a Publick House in New York to boisterously ridickule the Losers over several Pints of Ale for which he will paye.
