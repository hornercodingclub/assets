WASHINGTON--Explaining that the task was simply one of many professional responsibilities he is required to perform, Chief Justice John Roberts reportedly stopped partway through administering the presidential oath of office Friday, turned to face those gathered on the National Mall, and reminded them this was just part of his job. "Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear--hey, just so everyone knows, it's not like I'm choosing to be up here; it's just something I'm kind of obligated to do," said Roberts, who asked those in attendance and those watching at home to keep in mind that with few exceptions, every United States president has been sworn in by the chief justice, and that he couldn't really do anything about it at this point. "I just want to be perfectly clear: I didn't volunteer for this. I'm just carrying out a duty that comes with being head of the Supreme Court and that's it. Got it? Okay--do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States." At press time, Trump had also paused while reciting the oath of office to remind the audience that regardless of whether or not he intends to adhere to anything the oath stipulates, saying it aloud was just part of his job too.
