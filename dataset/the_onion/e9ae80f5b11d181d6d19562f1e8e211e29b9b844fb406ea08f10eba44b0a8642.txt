SAN DIEGO--Cautioning that the initiative was being instituted on a trial basis only, Forrest Logistics CEO Wayne Gartner announced Thursday that the company had recently begun experimenting with valuing its employees. "For the next three months, we'll be treating our workers as skilled professionals we appreciate having on our staff instead of as disposable laborers whose morale could not matter less to us," said Gartner, telling reporters that during this provisional period, management would be assessing the long-term viability of constructively addressing employee concerns and creating an overall positive work environment. "This is completely new to us, obviously, but that's why we're just testing it out. If need be, we can go back to essentially telling our workers that they're lucky we hired them in the first place." At press time, the initiative had been canceled after estimates revealed it would cost the company upwards of $2,500 annually.
