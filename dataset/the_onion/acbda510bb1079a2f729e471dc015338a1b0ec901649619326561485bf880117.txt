LOS GATOS, CA--Arousing the attention of townspeople with repeated peals of their handbells before pausing to recite from scrolls stowed in their red frock coats, Netflix town criers were dispatched to public squares across the land Tuesday to herald the arrival of Season 6 on Netflix streaming, sources nationwide reported. "Here ye, good sirs and madams with active Netflix subscriptions! By proclamation of the most honorable press office of Netflix, Inc., let it be known to all persons that the sixth-most season of Emmy Award-winning AMC drama is available to Watch Instantly forthwith," bellowed town crier Nathaniel Hodges as he traversed the residential streets of Yardley, PA, drawing townsfolk out to their verandas to hear tell of the new addition to the company's extensive movie and TV library. "I hereby decree that all 13 episodes of this riveting season shall be available on PCs, Macs, TVs, tablets, gaming consoles, and an expanding selection of internet-capable devices. Come one, come all to see if the goodman Don Draper returns to his philandering ways and whether Peggy will prosper in her new role at Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough!" At press time, village sources reported that the crier had posted notice of the latest Netflix offerings on the door of the local pub and set forth across the Delaware River to bring the hopeful tidings to the good subscribers of West Trenton, NJ.
