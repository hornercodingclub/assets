BRATTLEBORO, VT--In an effort to experience a happening freak-out in an outta sight way, a far-out chick is, sources confirmed, currently groovin' on a doobie wave, feeling the vibes, and tripping out on a psychedelic reefer wave. "Sure, I'll have some," said the mama bear flower girl, accepting a long, mellow toke from a radical doob that, brother, will reportedly take this little moon child one step closer to the cosmic ashram on the day-glo astral plane. "Thanks." At press time, time had lost all meaning, man, ya dig, and sources were reporting that this spaced-out chick was most definitely groovin' and cruisin' on a righteous trip to a land without bummers.
