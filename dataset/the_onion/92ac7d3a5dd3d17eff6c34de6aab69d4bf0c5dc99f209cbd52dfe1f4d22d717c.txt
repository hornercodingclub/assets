PALATINE, IL--During a tennis tournament hosted by Fremd High School, spectators, coaches, and fellow competitors agreed Thursday that the massive gulf in skill levels between top-ranked Anthony Pagano and bottom-seeded Tyson Vandervennet was the most amusing thing they had ever seen on a tennis court. "Anthony is like a Greek god with a pretty good cross-court forehand, and the other squirt can't even get the ball over the net," said spectator Keith Horvath, stopping to laugh after a Pagano serve knocked the racket out of Vandervennet's hand. "This is so priceless. Pagano must be at least 6'2" and is clearly going to be playing tennis in college. And then you have this smaller kid who is probably padding out his college applications and definitely does not want to be here. The look of terror on his face is so damn funny." As of press time, Vandervennet's mother Lydia was only making the entire thing more crushingly comical by shouting "good try, honey" after a powerful serve bounced off her son's chest.
