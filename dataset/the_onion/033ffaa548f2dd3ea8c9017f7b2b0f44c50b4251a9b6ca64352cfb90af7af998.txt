MODESTO, CA--Standing at a urinal in a ballpark men's room Sunday afternoon, 5-year-old Derek Hill estimated that he likely has about a year left of urinating in public restrooms with his pants all the way down to his ankles. "It's probably going to look really weird if I'm still doing this at 7 or 8, and I am willing to acknowledge that," said Hill, standing with his legs far apart and holding his rolled-up shirt above his abdomen. "Which is annoying, because it's just so much easier this way, you know? I know it won't last forever, so I figure I might as well keep dropping my pants to the ground to pee while I still can." Hill later lamented that as recently as 2012 it had been acceptable for him to avoid the inconvenience of getting up at night to use the bathroom by simply urinating in the comfort of his own bed.
