NEW YORK--The latest viral sensation erupted across YouTube today as a recently uploaded video featuring a solitary man softly weeping into his palms garnered over 50 million plays in just one night. "'Weeping Guy' was uploaded just yesterday at 10 p.m., but it's already everywhere; people are watching it over and over again and then sharing it with all of their friends," said BuzzFeed editor Robert Meadows, adding that the 57-second video of an unnamed grown man sitting at a table while crying is "the most popular YouTube video [he's] seen in quite some time." "I've already had at least 20 different people I know forward the video to me. People just can't get enough of the guy." So far, "Weeping Guy" has already spawned dozens of spin-off videos featuring YouTube users crying alone in their own homes, with hundreds more expected by the end of the day.
