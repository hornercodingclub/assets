JOPLIN, MO--Saying that even a small amount of the grain gives her trouble, local grandmother Gertrude Rogers, 84, announced Monday that corn has been added to the list of food items that upset her stomach. "Oh, I just can't handle corn like I used to anymore," said Rogers of the cereal plant, which has been identified along with broccoli, red meat, milk, peppers, legumes, cabbage, fettuccine Alfredo, dill pickles, honey glazed ham, nuts, fried shrimp, and pineapple as a food she should avoid, especially after 7 p.m. "You go ahead and enjoy. I'll be just fine with the brown rice and some squash." At press time, Rogers confirmed that the squash was starting to make her feel "a little green around the gills."
