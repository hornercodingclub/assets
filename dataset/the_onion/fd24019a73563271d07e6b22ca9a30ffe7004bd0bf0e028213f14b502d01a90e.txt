WHITTIER, CA--Saying his regurgitated arguments about elites exploiting working-class Americans were simply precious, sources confirmed Wednesday that an adorable 23-year-old on a tirade about economic oppression must have just read Howard Zinn's for the first time. "Aw, listen to him going on and on about robber barons and American imperialism--isn't he the cutest?" observer Amber Irving said of Kyle Green, the young man who was reportedly all in a huff about the Spanish-American War, putting a knowing smile on the face of everyone within earshot. "Oh my goodness! Now he's throwing a little fit about railroad strikes, of all things. He's really quoting chapter and verse, isn't he? And look how earnest the little guy is!" At press time, sources reported a visibly worked-up Green had taken to social media to reappraise the legacy of Christopher Columbus.
