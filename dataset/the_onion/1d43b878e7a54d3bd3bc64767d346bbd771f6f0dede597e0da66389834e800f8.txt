NEW YORK--According to a new report released Saturday by Major League , a record number of outfield collisions have occurred during the 2012 season due to the rising trend of texting-while-fielding. "Unfortunately, we've seen over 600 incidents this year alone, which is roughly triple the number of recorded fielding crashes in 2009," said the league's Vice President of Baseball Operations, Joe Torre, revealing that approximately 70 percent of the outfielders in a recent survey admitted to sending texts or emails while trying to catch a pop fly within the last six months. "Texting-while-fielding is incredibly dangerous not only to yourself, but also your teammates. We know it might seem like an important message at the time, but it's just not worth the risk when you're chasing a line drive or sprinting for a hard grounder." At press time, Cleveland Indians outfielder Michael Brantley was being rushed to the hospital after slamming into Ezequiel Carrera while texting "I got it" to teammates.
