NEW YORK--New York Jets quarterback Chad Pennington, whose torn rotator cuff has sidelined him for the remainder of the 2005 season, still has that rarest of qualities for a quarterback: a normal, healthy son. "My boy Cole is a perfectly healthy, mentally stable child," Pennington said while watching 20-month-old Cole run around the yard and play with a football like any other toddler. "You see, unlike most sons of quarterbacks, Cole is completely free of multiple sclerosis, autism, leukemia, epilepsy, cancer, or cystic fibrosis. The doctors tell us it's a miracle." The Cole Pennington Foundation, which Chad and his wife Robin founded in their son's name in 2004, has raised over $2 million for the sons of Boomer Esiason, Dan Marino, Doug Flutie, Mark Rypien, Vinny Testaverde, and countless other less fortunate sons of NFL quarterbacks.
