WALTHAM, MA--Software developer WebTek Network Solutions went ahead and posted a listing for a job this morning as if the purportedly open position hadn't already been promised to a friend of one the company's current employees, sources confirmed Monday. "Seeking full-time sales rep for rapidly growing software business," reads the Monster.com listing, as though the company were actively seeking a qualified individual to fill the position and hadn't already informally hired a college roommate of WebTek associate marketing director Jeff Corbett. "Desired candidate must be energetic self-starter willing to expand client base in multiple targeted growth sectors. We offer comprehensive benefits, telecommuting opportunities, and a highly competitive base salary + bonuses. Starts immediately." At press time, WebTek's human resources manager had reportedly called five leading applicants to set up in-person interviews for the nonexistent position.
