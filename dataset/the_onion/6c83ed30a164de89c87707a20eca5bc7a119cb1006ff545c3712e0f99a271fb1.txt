WASHINGTON--According to a report released Monday, everything you have ever wanted--and, indeed, dreamed of--has been right in front of you all along. "If you would just open your eyes, you would see that the woman of your dreams--the sort of girl who could make you happy in ways no other woman ever could--has been right under your nose for years," the report read in part, adding that if you took just one second to think about it, you would realize that she's perfect for you. "The evidence is all there: She's been crazy about you since the day you met, yet somehow you've constantly overlooked her. But most significantly, she won't be around forever, so you'll just have to step up now if you finally want to understand the real meaning of love." The report went on to recommend that you just kiss her already.
