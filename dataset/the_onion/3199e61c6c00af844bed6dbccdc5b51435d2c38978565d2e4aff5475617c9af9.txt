CAMBRIDGE, MA--Stating that they just want to make sure it's something everyone keeps in mind going forward, an international consortium of scientists gently reminded the world Wednesday that clean energy technologies are pretty much ready to go anytime. "We've got solar, wind, geothermal--we're all set to move forward with this stuff whenever everyone else is," said Dr. Sandra Eakins, adding that researchers are also doing a lot of pretty amazing things with biomass these days. "Again, we're good to go on this end, so just let us know. You seriously should see these new hydrogen fuel cells we have. Anyway, just say the word, and we'll start rolling it out." At press time, representatives from the world's leading economies had signaled that they would continue to heavily rely on fossil fuels until they had something more than an overwhelming scientific consensus to go on.
