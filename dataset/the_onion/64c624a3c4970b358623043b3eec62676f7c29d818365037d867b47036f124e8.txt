HitchBOT, a robotic travel companion created by researchers as a social experiment, was destroyed by unknown vandals in Philadelphia this week on its hitchhiking tour of the U.S., saddening the robot's many admirers who followed its earlier trips through Europe and Canada.

Jennifer Munn * Spice Purveyor "Oh, they've been scaring robots with that story since the '60s." Stefan Kenney * Systems Analyst
