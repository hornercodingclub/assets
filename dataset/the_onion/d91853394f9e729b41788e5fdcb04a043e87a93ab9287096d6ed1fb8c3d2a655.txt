SAVANNAH, GA--Realizing something needed to change before it was too late, local alcoholic Darren Weller laid out a plan for turning his life around Monday that had absolutely nothing to do with getting sober. "Today's the day that I finally clean up my act and start taking the steps I need to better myself," said the visibly intoxicated Weller to his fellow bar patrons, outlining a series of dramatic steps aimed at improving his physical and mental health that will in no way interfere with his crippling addiction to alcohol. "No more excuses. It's time I went back to school and finished my degree. No more pizza and beer every night. I'll probably live five more years just by having salad and beer. Who knows, I might even start getting a run in every night before I hit the bars. Yeah, I really feel like this is a new beginning." At press time, Weller had passed out on his bar stool, already making good on his plan to get to sleep at a more reasonable hour.
