KANSAS CITY--Several Chiefs players spoke out Monday about the cheering that occurred in Arrowhead Stadium when quarterback Brady Quinn replaced the injured Matt Cassel, expressing their utter disbelief that Kansas City fans would openly applaud the former Notre Dame signal caller. "That's just sick, you know? People don't do fucked up stuff like cheering for Brady Quinn," said Chiefs tackle Eric Winston, adding that human beings simply don't roar with approval when a terrible player like Brady Quinn enters the game. "You cheer for a touchdown, a field goal, or even when a player you don't like gets hurt, but you don't cheer Brady Quinn. It's basic human decency." Winston also told reporters he was extremely embarrassed to be playing for a team with despicable fans that would give Brady Quinn a raucous ovation.
