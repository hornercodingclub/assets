LOS ANGELES--Chastising players for not sticking to their frowns during press conferences, head coach Steve Kerr reminded the Warriors Wednesday to seem sad about center DeMarcus Cousins' season-ending quad injury. "Remember, guys, nobody likes to be excluded. It might be nice to have a little more spacing on the court, but try not to smile too much and make sure to use a sad voice when discussing this," said Kerr, who told his team to "give Boogie a fist bump" when he's sitting on the sidelines and continue including him in the locker room. "I know it's going to be tough to remember, but try not to run up the score too much. It's going to make him feel like we don't need him. I've seen way too many hugs and high-fives over the last few days and not enough furrowed brows. We are upset about this, and everyone needs to stick to the plan." At press time, Kerr had stopped himself after nearly telling reporters this was the best his team looked all year.
