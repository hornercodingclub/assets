The Obama administration has reached a deal with Taliban leaders to release Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the last American prisoner of war in Afghanistan, in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees, a decision that has been criticized by GOP leaders who argue that it violates the nation's policy of not negotiating with terrorists. What do think? "Wow, the GOP must really be upset to just openly criticize Obama like that." Ted Corsick * Construction Estimator "It's unconscionable that we're releasing these Gitmo detainees now for a prisoner swap when legally they should have been released years ago for nothing." Stan McGinty * Systems Analyst "I bet beneath those five black hoods are five great big smiles." Katie Hoyt * Watercolor Artist
