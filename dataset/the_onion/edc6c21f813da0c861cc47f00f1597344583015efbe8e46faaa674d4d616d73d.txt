INDIANAPOLIS--After rallying to tie the Eastern Conference Finals at one game apiece, members of the Miami Heat expressed their confidence Wednesday that they have the right officiating to ultimately overcome the Indiana Pacers. "Indiana's a great team, no question, but at the end of the day I think we have the right group of refs on the court to push us to the win," Heat small forward LeBron James told reporters, adding that late in the game the team can always depend on officials to get them to the foul line. "In a tight series, you need to get the big whistles when it counts, and fortunately guys like [referee Joey] Crawford always deliver for us. They're obviously great during the regular season too, but they're really clutch in the playoffs." James went on to say that in the final seconds of a close contest, he trusts the refs to make the game-winning call.
