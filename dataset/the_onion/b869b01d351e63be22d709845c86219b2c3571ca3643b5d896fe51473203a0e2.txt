PYONGYANG--As the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday on the constitutionality of banning same-sex marriage, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un told reporters that, considering he's not a completely awful human being, he unequivocally believes that gay people should be able to marry. "Of course I believe gay and lesbian couples should be treated equally under the law, for God's sake; I'm not a monster," the despotic leader said, adding that the idea of trying to stop a loving couple from legally marrying one another is not only wrong from a moral and ethical standpoint but also violates the Fourteenth Amendment. "I have no idea what's going on with the justices over there, to be honest. The whole thing is a fucking embarrassment." Kim added that, should the Supreme Court not declare same-sex marriage constitutional in all 50 states, he would strongly consider launching a nuclear weapon at the United States.
