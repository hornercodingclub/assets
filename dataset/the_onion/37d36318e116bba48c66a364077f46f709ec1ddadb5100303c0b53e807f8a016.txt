After Disney announced it is making a live-action remake of the 1941 animated classic , PETA has demanded that producers change the original finale of the film, where Dumbo becomes the star of the circus, to a "happy ending" where he can retire from entertainment and escape to an elephant sanctuary. What do think? "Having to leave the circus would be a devastating blow to a natural performer like Dumbo." Chris Langridge * Teen Center Supervisor "I'm sure the captive elephant that plays Dumbo will love pretending to be free." Ben Young * Systems Analyst "PETA always gives good script notes."
