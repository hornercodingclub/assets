BUFFALO, NY--In the wake of his release from the Bills earlier this week, quarterback Vince Young was reportedly spotted sitting alone Thursday night rewatching the 2005-2006 BCS National Championship game on his laptop at a Buffalo bus depot. "Just look at that speed, that agility, that confidence to break out of the pocket and make a play," Young said to no one in particular, describing aloud the thrilling 41-38 victory over USC. "Fourth and five with 26 seconds left, the Longhorns down by five, can Young do it? There's the snap, Young steps back to pass, now he takes off for the end zone. Go Vince Go! Vince Young wins it for the Longhorns!" After watching the national championship trophy presentation, sources confirmed that Young was heard mumbling, "This kid will be a huge NFL star someday."
