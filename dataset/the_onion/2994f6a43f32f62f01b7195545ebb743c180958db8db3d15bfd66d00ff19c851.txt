WASHINGTON--Angrily dismissing offers of a plea deal if he would agree to cooperate with an investigation into the current administration's ties to Russia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly spit in the face of an FBI interrogator Thursday who was attempting to convince him to turn on President Trump. "If you goddamn Feds want to know whether I'll turn rat: Here's my answer," said Sessions, shortly before leaning over the small wooden table separating him and his interrogator and spitting directly into the FBI official's eyes. "I'm not gonna crack, so you G-men can threaten me with whatever the hell you want--you're just wasting your time. I'll fucking die before I flip, so you got the balls to kill me?" At press time, Sessions had reportedly begun to break down and was frantically divulging everything he knew after agents asked him how long he thought he would last on the inside with all the people he had helped put away on marijuana charges over the years.
