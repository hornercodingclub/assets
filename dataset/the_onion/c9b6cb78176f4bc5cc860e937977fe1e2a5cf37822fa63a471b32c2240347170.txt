President Obama faced backlash on Twitter after stepping out of Air Force One yesterday and saluting Marines with a Styrofoam cup in his right hand when his arms were full, which many have called disrespectful. What do think? "The decent thing to do would've been to ask the Marine to hold his drink while he salutes." Cory Owens * Systems Analyst "Everyone makes mistakes. Even the most cynical blogger will surely understand that." Rebecca Sullivan * Placemat Arranger "The commander-in-chief should know better than anyone that you only raise a Styrofoam coffee cup when saluting the Air Force. For the Marines, it's a Dasani bottle." Ben Mathis * Pebble Sorter
