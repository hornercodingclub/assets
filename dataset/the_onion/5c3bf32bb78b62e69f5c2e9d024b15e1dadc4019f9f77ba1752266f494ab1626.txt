NEW YORK--Shifting creative gears to pursue what he called "his other great passion in life," casual men's fashion, Paul Giamatti announced Friday that he would be cutting back on acting to launch a signature line of shapeless khakis and rumpled polos. "Over the years, I've heard from so many fans who wanted to dress like my characters that I figured, why not? I'll try designing loose-fitting, haphazard looks that evoke the classic 'Giamatti' brand," the 50-year-old Brooklyn native told fashion reporters, confirming that his not-quite-ready-to-wear line would range in size from large to extra large and be sold exclusively at Kohl's. "We're also featuring faded golf hats, shabby corduroy sport coats, loafers, and unnecessarily long button-downs. And if you were wondering how the pants are cut, don't worry--there will be ample roominess around the crotch." The official release of the Giamatti line will occur later this month with a runway show whenever East Windsor, New Jersey's historic Bowling & Recreation Center can fit it in.
