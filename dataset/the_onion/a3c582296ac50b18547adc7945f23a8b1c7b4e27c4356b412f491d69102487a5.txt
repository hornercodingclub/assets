BROOKLINE, MA--Chomping at the bit to twist the benign statement into an absolutely terrifying image, the subconscious of local man David Vanwell reportedly couldn't wait Monday to turn an offhand remark by his boss into a dream about a drowning horse. "Oh yeah, as soon as he falls asleep I'm going to manifest that frivolous comment from the earlier meeting into a horrifying visual of a stallion vainly flailing for its life as it slowly disappears underwater," said Vanwell's psyche, excitedly planning every detail of the panicked horse's descent to a watery grave that will somehow represent his supervisor's innocuous observation. "I've been waiting for the perfect excuse to drop a stallion in an above-ground swimming pool where it can sink down, down, down as if to the bottom of the ocean even though the pool itself is only six feet high, and now I have it. He's not going to know what hit him when the horse starts gurgling for help in his boss's voice." At press time, Vanwell's subconscious suddenly realized the drowning horse scenario could segue nicely into a scene of him being trapped inside a burning freight elevator that symbolized a casual text from his girlfriend.
