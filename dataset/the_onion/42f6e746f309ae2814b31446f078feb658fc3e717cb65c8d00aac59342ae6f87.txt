MUSKOGEE, OK--Halfheartedly ripping at the fabric from an armrest, depressed local cat Harvey on Monday was reportedly just going the motions of destroying a couch. According to sources, the American shorthair that has been listlessly raking deep claw marks into most of the couch's visible surface has been feeling a bit down recently. Reports confirm that, despite it usually being one of his favorite activities, the hours the cat spent tearing the fluff out of the cushions did nothing whatsoever to lift his spirits. Sources later reported that Harvey could barely even muster the energy to kick kitty litter all over the floor.
