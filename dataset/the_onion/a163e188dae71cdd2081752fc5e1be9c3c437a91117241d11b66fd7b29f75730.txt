In a brief YouTube video posted by the North Korean government, a sleeping citizen is depicted dreaming about the country's space technology and envisioning New York City aflame after a missile attack, all while an instrumental version of the song "We Are The World" plays in the background. What do think? "Oh my God, I had that exact same dream last night!" Ken Mirkovich * Gate Agent "Wouldn't it be easier for North Korea to just tell its citizens that this actually happened?" Linda Athons * Livestock Counter "It's a chilling video, but nowhere near as freaky as the ads with the Lunesta moth." Samir Hamoud * Acrobatic Rigger
