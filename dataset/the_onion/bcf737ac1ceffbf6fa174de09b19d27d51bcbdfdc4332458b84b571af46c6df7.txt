CHICAGO--Claiming that the franchise is now on the brink of finally achieving something truly great, Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Pace expressed his confidence Tuesday that the team has the right pieces in place to trade quarterback Jay Cutler. "We've been working toward this for a long time, and we're finally in a position to make our shared goal of getting Jay out of Chicago a reality," said Pace, noting that the recent addition of several highly rated draft picks gives the Bears the necessary firepower to convince another team to take on Cutler's contract. "It's going to take a lot of hard work and a bit of luck, but I believe we will accomplish what our players and coaching staff have dreamed about these last few years. There are plenty of doubters who think it will never happen, but I can tell you that everyone within the organization is aiming to prove them wrong. Next season, it's trade Cutler or bust." Reached for comment, Cutler expressed his willingness to do whatever it takes to help his team by getting the fuck out of Chicago next year.
