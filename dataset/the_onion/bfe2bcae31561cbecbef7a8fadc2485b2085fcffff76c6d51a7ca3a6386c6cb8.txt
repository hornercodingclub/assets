TERRE HAUTE, IN--A few days into his summer vacation, local 16-year-old John Vucinich told reporters Tuesday that he is excited to have the next three months to do nothing but sit back, relax, and meticulously plot out the details of the mass shooting he is planning for the upcoming school year. "After a long, stressful year, it's great to have all this free time to just kick up my feet and figure out exactly when, where, and how I'm going to make everyone pay," said Vucinich while lying comfortably in a deck chair and sketching out a "rough list" of students and teachers he plans on targeting during his upcoming rampage, as well as a tentative arsenal. "When class is in session, there's way too much homework and studying for me to spend on outside projects, like sketching out a route from the parking lot to the cafeteria in order to maximize the body count. But now I have all the time in the world! Will I get Clint and those guys on the football team first? Should I go for head shots or just spray the crowd? Luckily I have a long, lazy summer to figure all that stuff out." At press time, Vucinich was enjoying a glass of fresh squeezed lemonade while fantasizing about leaving homemade explosives in the trash cans by the gymnasium, the teacher's lounge, and the library.
