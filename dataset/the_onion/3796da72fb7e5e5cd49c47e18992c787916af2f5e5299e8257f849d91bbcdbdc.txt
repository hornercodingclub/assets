NEW YORK--Recognizing the 14-time All-Star as he played the final game of his 20-year MLB career Friday, the New York Yankees honored retiring third baseman Alex Rodriguez with a three-second-long tribute video. "We thought it was important to give Alex the sendoff he deserves," said manager Joe Girardi of the tribute, which appeared on the stadium's Jumbotron after the third inning and featured a 1.8-second clip of Rodriguez joining the team in 2004, followed by a photo of him raising the 2009 World Series trophy that appeared onscreen for 1.2 seconds, all to no music or sound whatsoever. "I think I speak for the entire organization when I say this video really shows exactly what Alex has meant to us." The tribute reportedly concluded by displaying the hashtag "#ThankYouARrod [sic]" on the Jumbotron for five-tenths of a second before animated stadium trivia abruptly resumed.
