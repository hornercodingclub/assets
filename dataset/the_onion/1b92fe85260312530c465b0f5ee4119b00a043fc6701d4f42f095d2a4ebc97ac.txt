Japanese animator Studio Ghibli, the maker of "Spirited Away" and "Princess Mononoke," is building a theme park based on its films, with plans to open next decade. What do think? "Good luck getting the Japanese interested in an immersive entertainment experience with cute, colorful characters." Doug Pennacchia * Soil Attendant "As long as there's a roller coaster that explores the same themes of environmental stewardship and familial piety as their films, I'm sold." Rick Willette * Undersea Calligrapher "My pretentious 7-year-old will love this." Lauren Austin * Cemetery Inspector
