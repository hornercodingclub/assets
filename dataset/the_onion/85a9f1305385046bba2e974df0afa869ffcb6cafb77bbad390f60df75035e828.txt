PHOENIX--Chicago Cubs players reluctantly followed Coach Lou Pinella's orders to pack their equipment for a trip to Arizona Monday, causing many on the ball club to wonder why they were starting spring training nearly six months ahead of schedule.  "Last offseason I at least got to spend a little time with my family," said Cubs second baseman Ryan Theriot while examining the unusual 2007 MLB Playoff patch on the right sleeve of his jersey. "We must have done something right this season, though, because I heard our first exhibition game is already sold out." Upon their arrival to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Theriot's theory regarding the team's improvement was immediately abandoned when he realized that the fans who had gathered to greet the Cubs were in fact booing them mercilessly.
