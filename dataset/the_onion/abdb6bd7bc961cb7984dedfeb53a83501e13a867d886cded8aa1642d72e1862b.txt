PROVO, UT--Following BYU's dismissal of one of its basketball players for having premarital sex with his girlfriend, teammates of former BYU star Danny Ainge confirmed Friday that the shooting guard got shitloads of pussy when he was enrolled at the school, fucking a different girl every night of the week from 1977 to 1981. "'All-The-Way Ainge' was boning chicks constantly. In fact, I remember his dorm room just reeking of pussy," said former BYU center Greg Kite, adding that Ainge was known across campus as "The Pussy Magnet," "The Pussy Vacuum," and "The Pussyhound of the Baskervilles." "In the 1979 NCAA tournament, he bent some woman over the laundry hamper in the locker room and fucked her from behind during halftime. For the rest of the game, whenever he handled the basketball, it smelled like pussy." Former Cougars power forward Fred Roberts recalled that Ainge liked to make women do all the work during sex, a style Ainge often referred to as "putting my cock on cooze control."
