A California woman has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly placing two bottles of orange juice containing lethal amounts of rubbing alcohol into a refrigerated case at a Starbucks in San Jose. What do think? "I like a little rubbing alcohol in my O.J., but not that much." Jeb Levin * Mannequin Decorator "If you look at it from her perspective, though, that's still really fucked up." Gayle Noble * Cabin Outfitter "That's nothing. Yesterday, this guy in line at Starbucks was screaming into his phone the whole time, and then when it came time to pay, he said he left his wallet in his car. Unbelievable."
