BAKERSFIELD, CA--In the immediate aftermath of the 83-year-old cult leader's passing, Charles Manson's loved ones on Monday asked for complete and utter chaos while they grieve. "As we mourn, we kindly ask that you respect our wishes by letting all hell loose and breaking every shackle of the old order," read a statement from the deceased's relatives, adding that those who wish to show their support are encouraged simply to "rise up from the bottom of time" and run wild in the streets. "We know that Charles would want those who knew him, because we're all God, to come together to shriek and rampage, overcome with madness as we tear each other limb from limb to find the heart of the world." The statement added that, in lieu of flowers, funeral attendees are invited to contribute to the coming race war.
