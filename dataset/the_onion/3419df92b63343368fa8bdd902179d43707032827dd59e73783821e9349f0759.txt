KANSAS CITY--Chiefs head coach Romeo Crennel told reporters this weekend that he will apply the team's French fries tag to Matt Cassel, preventing the eighth-year player from becoming an unsalted free agent at the end of this seasoning. "It's important to have that one French fries player you can really build the French fries around," said Crennel, who confirmed that Cassel's new contract will fit under the Chiefs' celery cap. "White Cassel is an exceptionally talented quarterpounderback, so it's nice to know he'll stay here while we continue to negotiate a long-term meal." Crennel said he would consider taking the French fries tag off Cassel if the Cleveland Browns were willing to trade both linebacker Scott Fajita and a high-draft pickle.
