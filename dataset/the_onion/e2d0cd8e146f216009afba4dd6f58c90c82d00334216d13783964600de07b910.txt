An Iowa entomologist discovered a corn rootworm that has evolved to be resistant to a pesticide produced by a genetically modified corn plant the Monsanto company developed to ward off that very bug. What do think? "That's why I always add extra pesticides to my produce the minute I get home." Julie Aldred * Unemployed "Uh-oh, you don't want to make Monsanto angry. Those worms had better get ready to have their asses sued off." Dan Holloway * Immunohematologist "You sure are talking up these rootworms quite a bit. Whose side are you on, anyway?"
