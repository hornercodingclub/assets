MONTREAL--Upon releasing documents Monday relating to the verdict against 2010 Tour de France winner Alberto Contador, World Anti-Doping Agency officials mentioned to reporters they have plenty of stripped Tour titles in the office that anybody could drop by and take. "We're not going to being doing anything with all these trophies. Just call us before you come by, and we'll have them put your name down in the record books as the winner," said WADA president John Fahey, who dropped off boxes of tainted yellow jerseys at Goodwill earlier in the day. "They're cycling trophies, so they're not worth anything, but they might work well as a fruit bowl." Fahey said the agency wants to get rid of the titles quickly, as "they will really start cluttering up the place" when Lance Armstrong is finally convicted.
