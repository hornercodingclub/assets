LOS ANGELES--Upon emerging from an advance screening of the Walt Disney Pictures film , representatives of the country's American Indian population enthusiastically praised the action-adventure comedy Wednesday, telling reporters that they were thrilled to finally see a movie that does justice to the stirring history of the nation's native peoples. "At long last, we have a tale befitting the long, proud tradition of our tribespeople," said Douglas Walking Bear Akando, 94, a Potawatomi tribe elder who claimed he was moved to tears by lead actor Johnny Depp's stoic, thoroughly researched portrayal of the spirit warrior Tonto in the upcoming Jerry Bruckheimer production. "For all of Hollywood's failed attempts to create something that accurately recounts our glorious past while also honoring the bravery and wisdom of our ancestors, does just that. And on July 3, the American people will finally know our story." At press time, a coalition representing the nation's estimated 3 million American Indians had released a statement completely forgiving the United States for its systematic butchery and subsequent confinement of their people, saying that the new Lone Ranger movie "had made it all worth it."
