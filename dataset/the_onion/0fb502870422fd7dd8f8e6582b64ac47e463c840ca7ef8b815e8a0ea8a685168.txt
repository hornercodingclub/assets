MIAMI-- Dolphins players and coaches admitted Friday that they regret allowing the HBO series to film their training camp, expressing frustration after repeatedly hearing the documentary crew openly refer to the team as "pathetic fucking losers." "I don't like those people coming in here saying how much we suck and talking about my guys as 'sacks of shit in teal,'" said Dolphins coach Joe Philbin, whose players' meeting on Thursday was listed on the production schedule as "Poor Bald Fuck Tries to Inspire Talentless Doormats." "The director yelled 'cut' when we were running passing routes because he said they already had hours of footage of has-beens and shitty draft picks dropping passes and needed to get a shot of somebody actually catching the ball." At press time, the crew complained out loud about having to film a "sorry-ass practice" and refused to interview players, claiming the Dolphins would "fuck that up, too."
