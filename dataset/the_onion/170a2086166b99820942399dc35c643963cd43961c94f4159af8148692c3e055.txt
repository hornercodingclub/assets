Keith Rainere, the founder of Nxivm, which has been described as a pyramid scheme, sex-trafficking operation, and a cult, will be sentenced on Tuesday after a federal jury found him guilty on all charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, and posession of child pornography last year. What do think? "Sex cults just can' t catch a break." Miles Bielski * Headphones Expert "This is why it's so important to keep your pyramid scheme and your cult separate." Jay Morris * Tire Buffer "This Rainere guy better hope the judge doesn't have HBO." Marlene Holt * Root Cellar Organizer
