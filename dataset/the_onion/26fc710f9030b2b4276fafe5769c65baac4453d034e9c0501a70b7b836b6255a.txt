CLEVELAND--Upset with his lackluster fouling performance through Game 4 of the NBA conference finals, Cavaliers guard Delonte West stayed after team practice to work on fouling drills Wednesday night. "I still haven't gotten into a good fouling rhythm yet," said West, who joined Anderson Varejao and Dahntay Jones for two extra hours to practice knocking down one another's shooting arms. "We need to go back to basics and commit fundamentally sound fouls, so we're doing the classic drills--the Hammerdown, the Hot Swat, and Murder-Suicides, where we run to the foul line, shove a guy down, run to half-court, headlock a guy. We are not going to win this series unless we're punching [Hedo] Turkoglu in the face and throwing our hands up in the air to indicate that it was not a foul." West ended the interview by catching a reporter in the jaw with his elbow and pushing him to the ground.
