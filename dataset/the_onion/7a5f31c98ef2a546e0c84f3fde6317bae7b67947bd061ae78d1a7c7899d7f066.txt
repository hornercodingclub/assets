Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will step down today after four years on the job and hand over the reins of U.S. foreign policy to retiring senator John Kerry. What do think? "Last days at work are the best. She could probably leave at like 3 and no one could even give her any shit about it." Elton Lister * Patrol Sergeant "Foreign diplomats, prepare to be electrified!" Kristin Burton * Valve Repairer "It's technically not her last day. This upcoming Monday she has to give her exit interview with HR, then stick around the State Department until Friday to train Kerry." Willie Sly * Dairy Farmer
