NEW YORK--In an overwhelming show of support for dangerously escalating temperatures, 7.1 billion people from nearly every nation on earth staged massive demonstrations yesterday in favor of global warming. "Whether they were sitting in their living rooms, watching football at a bar, or just driving somewhere, a sizable portion of the world let its support for climate change be heard loud and clear," said environmental policy expert Janet Purvis, adding that the protest that began in the morning never lost steam at any point throughout the day. "This should serve as a wake-up call to officials around the world that the factors contributing to global warming are real, important, and must be protected at any cost." At press time, the 7.1 billion protesters were reportedly making plans to stage similar rallies every day for the foreseeable future.
