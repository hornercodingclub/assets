ALLENTOWN, PA--Recognizing that their child is old enough now to have such an important conversation, local parents Nick and Karen Yates reportedly sat down with their 10-year-old son Nathaniel on Monday to have the talk. "Seeing is perfectly natural, but we wanted to make sure you heard the facts from us and not from some random place on the Internet," said mother Karen Yates, adding that Steven Soderbergh's 1989 film starring James Spader and Andie MacDowell may initially seem confusing and even uncomfortable, but that was to be expected at first. "You shouldn't rush into it by any means. You want your first time to be with someone special. In fact, your father and I didn't watch until after we were married, and, honestly, we were better off for having waited that long." Yates went on to say, however, that there was no shame in practicing watching the movie with someone else by first watching clips of it by himself in the privacy of his room.
