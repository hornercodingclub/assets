LOS ANGELES--Players and fans alike are saying that Blake Griffin's latest dunk, while a solid, unstoppable one-handed jam, was actually more irritating than it was breathtaking or impressive. "Just the way he palmed the ball was, like, 'Oh, I'm going to jump up with this and place it through the hoop now, ooh, look at me,'" said Lakers center Andrew Bynum, adding that the dunk was "probably going to come back to bug [him] all week at odd moments" until the playoffs started. "And the way he jumped? Tell me that wasn't the most aggravating jump you've seen since Reggie Miller was playing." Despite the generally acknowledged off-putting nature of Griffin's dunk, onlookers agreed Kobe Bryant was still the most annoying thing about the game.
