LADUE, MO--After struggling and looking stale in his last few starts, Rams quarterback Marc Bulger paid a visit to the Barnes & Noble Booksellers at Ladue Crossing Shopping Center to peruse books and periodicals in hopes of getting new and interesting touchdown ideas. "I don't want to give Tory [Holt] and Steven [Jackson] the same old boring touchdown passes and handoffs every time," said Bulger, who was reportedly skimming through Tolstoy's , cocking his arm back, nodding his head, and jotting down something in a small black notebook. "And I can't just watch the opposing team's quarterback for touchdown ideas, because then I'm not doing anything new or original. Getting into the minds of contemporary thinkers and writers can help push football forward. Though I also get touchdown ideas while just watching movies." Witnesses claim that Bulger left the store without buying anything.
