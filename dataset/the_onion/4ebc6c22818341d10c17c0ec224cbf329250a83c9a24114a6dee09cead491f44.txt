INDIANAPOLIS--The NCAA Board of Directors made the decision Wednesday to expand its men's basketball tournament to however many teams "really and truly believe" they ought to be involved. "Who are we to bar a school from the Big Dance if they just know in their heart of hearts that they deserve a shot?" said NCAA interim president Jim Isch, adding that the maximum number of teams permitted would only be limited by the number of schools that believe in themselves. "Of course, for any team out there that wants to be in the tournament but doesn't quite think it deserves it, I say go ahead and put your name on the list anyway. Seriously, what's one more team?" Immediately following the announcement, all 342 Division I schools signed up for the 2011 tournament except Loyola Marymount.
