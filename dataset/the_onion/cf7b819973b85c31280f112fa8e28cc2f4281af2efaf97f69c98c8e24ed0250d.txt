NEW YORK--Saying it was hard not to unfavorably compare himself to his peers, part-time catering assistant Ian Presser, 26, told reporters Thursday that he feels self-conscious after always seeing his friends fail slightly less than him. "When everyone in my social circle is making $1.50 an hour more than me and lasting six months at their jobs before getting fired, I can't help feeling like I don't stack up," said Presser, adding that his friends' total ineptitude at maintaining healthy relationships makes him acutely aware of his inability to land a single date. "Am I happy for them? Sure. But it still really stings when I hear that my buddy is pulling in 28 G's and living in a one-bedroom with only two other roommates. It's like, 'What am I doing wrong?'" Presser went on to say that he at least took some solace in the fact that he lasted a semester longer than his brother before dropping out of college.
