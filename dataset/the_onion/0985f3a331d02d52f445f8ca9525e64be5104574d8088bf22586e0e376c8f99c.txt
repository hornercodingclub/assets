NORTHFORD, CT--Revealing just how old-fashioned and small-minded he truly is, local sexist pig Jonathan Scott admitted Monday he has no idea what time the U.S. women's soccer team plays Nigeria tomorrow night, sources reported. "Is the game on at 4 or 8?" said the misogynistic prick, who clearly believes that women are inferior athletes to men and therefore do not deserve an opportunity to participate in major athletic competitions such as the Women's World Cup. "It's on Fox, right? Not Fox Sports 1?" The disgusting woman-hater then reportedly questioned whether Team USA's offense could get its act together in time for the knockout rounds.
