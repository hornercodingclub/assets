PAOLI, PA--Poised to inform future parenting decisions on medical care, dietary restrictions, and everyday well-being, the blog post "Fluoride Drops For Kids--Good Idea?" which was read by local mother Laurie Miller earlier today, will reportedly shape the next 18 years of her young child's life. Reports indicate that after skimming the 300-word article published on Mommymuse.com, Miller will consider the entry on the pros and cons of fluoride drops as the authoritative text on the matter, citing the write-up countless times while speaking with her child's babysitters, teachers, and pediatricians over the next two decades. Sources confirmed that the article's two-sentence summary of the tooth enamel condition "Colorado Brown Stain," which was derived from an anonymously authored post on a soon-to-be-defunct dental hygiene message board, will flash through Miller's mind every time her son takes a drink of water from now until he leaves for college. At press time, sources reported that Miller was closely inspecting her child's teeth for streaks, a practice that will soon become a twice-daily routine.
