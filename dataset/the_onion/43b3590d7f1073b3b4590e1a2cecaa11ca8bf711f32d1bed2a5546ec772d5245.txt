BELLINGHAM, WA--Praising the actress' laid-back personality and skill as a performer, local woman Becca Miser told friends Tuesday how much she likes movie star Jennifer Lawrence, unaware that she will completely turn on the actress and hate her in seven years' time. "She has such a great sense of humor, she doesn't have a huge ego, and she's really down to earth compared to a lot of other celebrities," Miser said of Lawrence, whom in the year 2020 she will call "completely fake," "so self-involved," and "trying way too hard." "I could totally imagine hanging out with her in real life. And I think she's so beautiful, too." At press time exactly seven years from today, Miser is telling her friend that Lawrence "needs to lose some fucking weight."
