EDEN PRAIRIE, MN--Responding to speculation that Adrian Peterson's sprained knee may be the result of overusing the talented rookie, Vikings head coach Brad Childress released a statement Monday defending his practice of using the superstar rookie on rushing plays, passing plays, kickoff returns, punt returns, movie returns, grocery runs, and home repairs. "Adrian is a great young talent, and the team doctors say he can still do a lot for this team, both on the field and around my house," Childress said of the multi-tasking back who currently leads the league in yards raked. "Naturally, situations will dictate how he's used, but you can expect to see him playing an increased role around my household. Any coach in this league would love to have a player who can put an entire team or bedroom set on his back and carry them into the postseason or attic." Peterson, who spent Tuesday's practice washing Childress' car at a Minnetonka self-service car wash, said that his injured knee wouldn't affect his aggressive cleaning style.
