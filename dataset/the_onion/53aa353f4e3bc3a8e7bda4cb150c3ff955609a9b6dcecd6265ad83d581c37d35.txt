NEW YORK--Matt Leinart, the USC quarterback, former Heisman Trophy winner, and current ESPN Hottest Male Athlete, cashed in early at the 2006 NFL Draft when he was chosen first by a panel of eight celebrity judges in the draft's Tuesday night beauty pageant at New York's W Hotel. "Matt was the obvious No. 1 pick--he has the All-American bone structure, the amazing eyes, and the hair that has stunned all the scouts," said celebrity judge and NFL Network host Rich Eisen, who presented Leinart with the draft pageant's coveted Joe Namath Trophy. "Get used to seeing this kid on magazine covers nationwide, if you haven't already." Leinart was modest when accepting the trophy, but said he was concentrating on Saturday's player draft, during which he is expected to be upstaged by less handsome athletes with stronger throwing arms and more mobility.
