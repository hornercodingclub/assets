SAGINAW, MI--Saying he had been "shaken up pretty badly" after hitting rock bottom from 2001 to 2013, local man Phillip Garvey, 41, told reporters Tuesday that the past 12 years had been the incident that finally motivated him to turn his life around. "It was a real eye-opener for me as soon as things got really rough there for about a dozen years," Garvey said of the period during which he endured a failed marriage, a bankruptcy, and a bout with alcoholism. "Those years when I was between the ages of 29 and 41, that's when it truly hit me: Something's gotta change. I have to start taking charge of my life right now." Garvey later admitted that while he'd had "a pretty good scare" between 1993 and 2000, the past 12 years had really been "the last straw."
