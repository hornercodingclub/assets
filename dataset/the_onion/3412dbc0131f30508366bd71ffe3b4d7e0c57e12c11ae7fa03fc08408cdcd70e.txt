PITTSBURGH--Steelers third-string quarterback Charlie Batch told reporters Wednesday that he still felt completely humiliated by the shame of nearly losing to Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in week 13. "Oh my God, I can't believe that I had to put together a 61-yard drive in the closing minutes just to beat Joe Flacco," said the absolutely mortified 38-year-old, who has recorded 61 touchdowns and 52 interceptions during a NFL career spent almost entirely as a backup. "That could have been the last game I ever started or even played in. If you lose to Joe Flacco, you know it's all over. There's just no way you can call yourself a pro quarterback after that." Ravens wide receiver Anquan Boldin expressed empathy for Batch, admitting that he often feels totally embarrassed to be seen in the same huddle as Joe Flacco.
