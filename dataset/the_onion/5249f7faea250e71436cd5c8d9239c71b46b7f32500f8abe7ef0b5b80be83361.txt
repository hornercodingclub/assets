TEMPE, AZ--Stressing the importance of being prepared for any circumstance that may occur, local man James Donner told reporters Monday he carries a gun on his person at all times in case he ever needs to escalate a situation. "I never leave home without my Glock, because you just don't know when someone might mouth off to you in a bar and leave you with no choice but to turn a minor altercation into a tense life-or-death scenario," said Donner, noting that he keeps his loaded weapon in a hip holster should the need arise for him to respond quickly, and with deadly force, when he is angered by a perceived slight. "Look, I hope to God no one ever tries to hit on my wife while I'm within earshot, but in the real world, things like this do happen. Sometimes you only have a split second to react and make things exponentially more dangerous." At press time, sources confirmed Donner was pulling up next to a Honda Civic that had cut him off in traffic several blocks earlier.
