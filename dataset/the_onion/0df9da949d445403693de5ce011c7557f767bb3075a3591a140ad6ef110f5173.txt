WEST PALM BEACH, FL--Observing that the unborn child was producing the smooth, fluid strokes expected in the third trimester, ob-gyn Dr. Theresa Umbers reportedly assured world No. 4-ranked tennis player Serena Williams at an appointment Tuesday that her fetus was developing its serve right on schedule. "As you can see on the ultrasound, your baby is getting great extension on its serve, and if you look closely you can even spot the beginning of a little topspin," said Umbers, who noted that only a few weeks ago Williams' child had developed the ability to loosely form a western forehand grip. "Your baby's pinpoint stance is exactly where you want it to be at 24 weeks. Pretty soon it will be able to generate more power for aggressive serves, and you might even be able to feel its follow-through in the next few days." According to sources, Williams has chosen to wait until the birth to learn whether her child is a baseline or serve-and-volley player.
