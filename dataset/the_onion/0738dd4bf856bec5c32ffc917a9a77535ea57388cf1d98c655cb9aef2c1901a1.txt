PALM BEACH, FL--Noting that it had already been there for almost two weeks, Mar-a-Lago assistant manager Chris Mahoney reportedly wondered Monday if anyone was coming to collect the nuclear briefcase from the club's lost-and-found. "Someone noticed it in the dining room and dropped it off, and it's just been sitting at the bottom of the bin ever since," said Mahoney, adding that he had been asking people coming to collect their lost scarves and sunglasses if they might also have misplaced a briefcase attached to a pair of handcuffs. "You'd think whoever it belongs to would have realized that they lost it by now. Well, I'll give it a few more weeks--if no one claims it after 60 days, it's up for grabs, and I can see if someone on my staff wants it." At press time, a man had mistakenly claimed the briefcase as his own before getting home to discover all the unfamiliar buttons inside.
