WASHINGTON--During a postgame press conference Saturday in which he registered disappointment at being shut out for the 22nd time this season, Nationals manager Manny Acta became visibly confused after being told by reporters that his team had actually scored a run during its 6-1 loss to the San Diego Padres. "If we scored like you say we did, there's no way we got it by hitting the baseball and advancing the runners, because I would have remembered something like that," a skeptical Acta said. "What I do recall is a lot of weak ground balls back to the pitcher, botched sacrifice bunts, and double plays to end innings. Maybe we walked or people got hit by pitches four consecutive times?" When informed that first baseman Aaron Boone hit a two-out RBI in the 8th inning to score Emilio Bonifacio, Acta responded, "Yeah, right."
