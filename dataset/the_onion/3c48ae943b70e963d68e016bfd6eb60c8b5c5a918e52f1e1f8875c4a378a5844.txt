NEW YORK--Major League Baseball's latest effort to achieve competitive parity by having larger-market teams share their runs with small-market teams drew fire last Wednesday after owners complained that the rule unfairly penalized better-performing clubs. "Subsidizing the offense of other teams isn't our job, so it really hurts when the Yankees lose because we have to give two of our five runs to the Royals," said Yankees owner Hank Steinbrenner, referring to the previous night, when the league determined a Derek Jeter double off Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander had driven in Kansas City's Wilson Betemit and Mike Aviles. "And the Royals still got beat by the Orioles in extra innings." According to the agreement, the only big-market team that does not have to share its runs is the New York Mets "because, well, they're the New York Mets."
