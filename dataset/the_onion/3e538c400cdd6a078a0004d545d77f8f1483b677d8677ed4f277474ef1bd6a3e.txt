WASHINGTON--At times struggling to hold back tears, a solemn President Donald Trump ordered all flags to half-staff Friday in honor of an American killed in the line of duty on an episode of . "Today we honor New York City police officer Vincent 'Vinny' Cruz, a hero who cared so deeply about the people he served that he was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect them," said the president of the brash, fast-talking cop who was partnered with lead character Jamie Reagan at the beginning of season three. "Officer Cruz attempted to apprehend a thief inside the Bitterman housing project--the same housing project he himself rose up from years ago--totally unaware that he was walking into an ambush orchestrated by Santana and his Los Lordes gang. Once the shooting stopped, it was tragically evident that Vinny was mortally wounded. I offer my heartfelt condolences to Police Commissioner Frank Reagan and the entire NYPD." An angry Trump later vowed to redouble his efforts to punish sanctuary cities such as New York, certain that undocumented immigrants were involved in the brave officer's death.
