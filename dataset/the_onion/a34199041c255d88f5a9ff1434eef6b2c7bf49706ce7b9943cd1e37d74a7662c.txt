JUPITER, FL--Sources confirmed Friday that what college recruiter Jeff Watters is currently doing will be the subject of a massive NCAA investigation in five years. "What's happening right now with that top recruit will likely be the focal point of a seven-part expose in and several days' worth of intense coverage in the near future," said one anonymous source, only specifying that the impermissible dealings include promises of "temporary gifts" for the player and the realization that his high school coach would be a perfect candidate for the university's newly vacant Director of Player Personnel position. "The envelope he just handed that high school senior will be the smoking gun at the end of a long trail of subpoenaed bank statements and one-on-one interviews with other recruits and players. All of this will be denied by everyone involved and NCAA personnel will spend months, possibly years, sorting through the details." The unnamed source added that the entire investigation and sentencing will take place after both the star player and Watters have left the college's football program.
