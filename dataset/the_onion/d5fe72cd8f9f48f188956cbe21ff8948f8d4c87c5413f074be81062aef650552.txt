LOS ANGELES--After enduring years of failed relationships and heartbreak, actress Jennifer Aniston is now engaged to boyfriend Justin Theroux, a man who is not and will never be a true replacement for Brad, representatives for Aniston and Theroux confirmed Monday. "Justin seems like a very nice guy who treats Jen very well, but c'mon, you can't tell me he even holds a candle to Brad," said Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane, adding that "Justin's fine, but Brad's, like, ." "Sure, she's happy, but is she as happy as she'd be if she had just stayed with Brad? Of course not. And you know she knows it." Sources reported, however, that Aniston's relationship with Theroux is still "way better than anything she ever had with [Counting Crows frontman] Adam [Duritz]."
