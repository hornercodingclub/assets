The revelation that Wisconsin shooter Wade Michael Page played in the hardcore punk white-power bands End Apathy and Definite Hate has increased the public's awareness of the so-called 'hatecore' style of music, which is used as a recruitment tool by white supremacist organizations. What do think? "Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I prefer the old racist soft jazz." Bo Sheng Li * Systems Analyst "One day I hope to live in a world where hardcore racist music isn't created to recruit white supremacists, but is instead played purely for the enjoyment of its listeners." Cynthia Cutolo * Needle Straightener "I can see why they would use this type of music--it's so catchy. There's this one song where the guy screams 'fuck, fuck, fuck!' 300 times in a row, and it's been stuck in my head all day." Ted Casperson * Kosher Inspector
