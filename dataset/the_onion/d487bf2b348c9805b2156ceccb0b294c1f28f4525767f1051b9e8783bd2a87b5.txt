LOS ANGELES--Two-time NBA Finals MVP Kobe Bryant, who claims he typically looks forward to the 82-game professional basketball season, told reporters Friday that he's "just not feeling it" this year. "Yeah, I don't know," Bryant said after a practice at which he arrived, took three lackadaisical jump shots, and left without removing his jacket. "The whole basketball deal isn't really my thing right now. I don't really want to get into it." When asked if he cared whether he won another NBA title, thereby tying the number of championships won by Michael Jordan, Bryant responded, "Nah."
