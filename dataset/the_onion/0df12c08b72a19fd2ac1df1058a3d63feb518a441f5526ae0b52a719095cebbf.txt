CHICAGO--Scott Milloy, a longtime Ultimate Fighting Championship fan, would have stopped watching televised matches in the full-contact fighting series long ago if not for the well-informed, insightful color commentary of UFC host Joe Rogan. "A lot of these new guys may be better fighters than the UFC had in the old 'tough fat guy' era, but without Joe Rogan to give me the insider information that only a former Massachusetts Tae Kwon Do champ can give, I probably wouldn't even watch anymore," Milloy told friends before the Gracie-Hughes UFC matchup Saturday. "And he provides that insight in the way only a former star can. Truly an athlete and a scholar." Milloy later added that, as far as he could tell, the only blot on Rogan's stellar career was his two-season stint as a host of the , a position "beneath the dignity of an expert of the Octagon."
