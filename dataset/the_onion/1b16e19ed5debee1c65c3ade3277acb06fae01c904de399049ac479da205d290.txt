KANSAS CITY, MO--Speaking with a fiery passion about a deep hunger and desire, Chiefs coach Andy Reid reportedly motivated players Monday with an inspiring speech about an incredible burrito place he recently discovered. "I can tell you right now, the burrito at Taqueria El Comal had all the ingredients of a world champion," said Reid, his voice reportedly quivering as he described the effect of combining roasted chicken and carne asada to the players huddled around him. "And they don't just take tortillas from a package and steam them because, men, there are no shortcuts to perfection. They've got the trays of dough balls that they flatten out and grill to order, and that right there is the difference between a good burrito and a great one." Reid reportedly concluded the rousing 10-minute speech by requesting that any player who goes to Taqueria El Comal take his punch card, as he only needs three more purchases for a free steak taco.
