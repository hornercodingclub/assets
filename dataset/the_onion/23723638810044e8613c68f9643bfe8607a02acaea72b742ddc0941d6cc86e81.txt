NEW ORLEANS--Ahead of the much-anticipated matchup between the Ravens and 49ers, sources confirmed Tuesday that players from both teams have been resting up for an arduous week of intense Super Bowl hype. "It's been a long season and everyone's feeling weary, but we all need to be physically and mentally prepared for the fierce publicity ahead," said Ravens safety Bernard Pollard, adding that seasoned veterans like linebacker Ray Lewis are crucial to showing younger players how to properly handle the relentless interviews, commercial appearances, photo shoots, and social media interaction. "There are times when you don't think you can keep going, but you just have to dig deep and really push yourself to keep talking about how this is the biggest game of your life and how we've all fought so hard to get here. We'll be getting ready as though this is any other totally overhyped event, but in a lot of ways you can't totally prepare for such a huge promotional buildup." When reached for comment, 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters he is "relishing every moment" of the week-long Super Bowl hype after working his entire life to get to this level of attention.
