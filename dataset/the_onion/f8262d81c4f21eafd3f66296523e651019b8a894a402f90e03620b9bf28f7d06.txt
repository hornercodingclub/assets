WASHINGTON--According to a report released Monday by the New America Foundation, the race for the presidency could potentially culminate in exclusive victory by a single contender. "Data from the last 55 consecutive presidential elections strongly suggest that, come Nov. 5, one person and one person alone will assume the coveted title president-elect," said political analyst Lawrence O'Donnell, the report's main author. "We had assumed this election would be determined by a number of different factors--Jewish voters in Florida, blue-collar workers in Ohio, or dissatisfaction with the economy, for example--but the data were conclusive: This race is going to boil down to one man."  O'Donnell added that the contest could very well hinge upon winning a majority of the electoral college votes apportioned to the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
