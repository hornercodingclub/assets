PROVO, UT--Saddened to discover his favorite science fiction writer adhered to the controversial belief system, local fan Blake McKenna was disappointed to learn Monday that L. Ron Hubbard was a Scientologist. "Man, it's such a letdown to find out that someone whose work you really admire could be into Scientology," said McKenna, adding that he was struggling to reconcile the fact that the author of and was not only a devout member of the cultish religion but was also some sort of priest. "I mean, he's super into it like Tom Cruise--like, I can't even believe it. I've read upwards of 350 of his 500 stories, but now I honestly don't know if I'll be able to look at his work the same way." At press time, McKenna was having trouble reading now that he realized all the allusions Hubbard made to Scientology.
