VATICAN CITY--Recalling that he hid it somewhere among the dozens of sarcophagi underneath St. Peter's Basilica, Pope Francis was reportedly scouring the papal tombs Thursday in search of the final egg from the Vatican Easter Egg Hunt. "If I can't find this egg, the catacombs will totally reek," said the frustrated bishop of Rome while rifling through the final resting place of holy pontiffs, crawling on his hands and knees on the crypt floor to peek under the reliquary of Saint Peter. "I found all the eggs tucked away in the Pieta, the tabernacle, and confessional, and the one I hid in the hands of the embalmed body of Pope John XXIII, so the last Easter egg has got to be down here somewhere." At press time, Pope Francis was reportedly filled with disgust after rolling up the sleeves of his cassock, reaching into Leo X's coffin, and touching the putrefied remains of an egg from 2016.
