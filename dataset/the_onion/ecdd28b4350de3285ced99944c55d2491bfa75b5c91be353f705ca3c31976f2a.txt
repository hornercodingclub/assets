PINE BLUFF, AR--Telling their son he should take it easy because he deserves it, the parents of 26-year-old Austin, TX resident Jason Gibney referred to the time he spent visiting his family in Arkansas over the Easter weekend as a vacation, household sources confirmed Tuesday. "It must feel nice to escape from work and just kick back for a while, huh?" mother Linda Gibney said of the four days her son reportedly spent in a house where the local CBS affiliate was left on at high volumes the entire day and he slept on a twin mattress in a bedroom that doubles as a storage space, escaping only when he could borrow his parents' car. "We're so glad you decided to spend your vacation here. This is your little getaway, so just enjoy yourself and don't worry about anything. We want to make sure you relax." According to reports, halfway through his so-called vacation, Jason accompanied his father, Larry Gibney, on a trip to the hardware store.
