Donald Trump's childhood home in Queens is available to rent on Airbnb for $725 a night, with the listing's owner inviting guests to sleep in the bedroom where Trump was "likely conceived." What do think? "I'm going to need something more definitive than 'likely conceived' if I'm going to shell out $725 a night." Frank Choy * Pool Scrubber "Wow. Imagine how much more it'd cost if he hadn't lived there." Terrence Hess * Artifact Forger "Oh, these tourist traps will tell you Trump's parents fucked anywhere." Kate Breiner * Gift Packager
