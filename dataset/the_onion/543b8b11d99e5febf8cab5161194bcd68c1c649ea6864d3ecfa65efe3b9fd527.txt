PLANO, TX--At a meeting this morning with the snack brand's research and development department, Frito-Lay Senior Vice President George Legge wondered aloud if people would eat Doritos snack chips with M&M's on top of them, sources confirmed. "We could glue the M&M's on with powdered sugar or caramel or something; people would eat that, right?" Legge reportedly asked a roomful of colleagues, adding that "they've eaten other stuff like this." "Or maybe, like, Skittles or something? Or Twizzlers? Would they eat Doritos with Twizzlers on them?" At press time, a confident Legge had concluded that, sure, they would eat that.
