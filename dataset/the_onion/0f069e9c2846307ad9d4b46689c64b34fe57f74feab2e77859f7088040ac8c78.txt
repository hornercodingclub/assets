In an effort to protect buyers from products that don't do what they say they do, online marketplace Etsy has instituted a new policy banning spells, hexes, potions, and "[a]ny metaphysical service that promises or suggests it will effect a physical change (e.g., weight loss) or other outcome (e.g., love, revenge)."
