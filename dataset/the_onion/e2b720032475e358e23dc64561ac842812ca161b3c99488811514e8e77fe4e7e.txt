Viola Davis made history Sunday night as the first black woman to win an Emmy for Lead Actress in a Drama, highlighting in her acceptance speech the lack of such opportunities for women of color, explaining that "you cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there." What do think? "After a resounding speech like that, she is going to have her pick of the limited number of available roles!" Victor Malone * Costume Coordinator "Can't Hollywood go a single day without hearing about its systemic bigotry?" Todd McCutchen * Orchard Supervisor "I'm still reeling from such a game-changing Carmen Marc Valvo gown." Sandra Rosen * Appeal Filer
