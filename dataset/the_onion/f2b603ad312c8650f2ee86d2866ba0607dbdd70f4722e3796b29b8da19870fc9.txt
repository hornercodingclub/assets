PENSACOLA, FL--After Monday's deadly explosions at the Boston Marathon cast a pall over Conner Mason's 7th birthday celebration, the Mason family reportedly realized that each of their birthdays were now tainted by a national tragedy. "Our youngest daughter's birthday is September 11, Julie's is on the Virginia Tech anniversary, Lauren's falls on the Aurora shooting, and my husband's is on the Newtown massacre," said Anne Mason, 39, local mother of five children whose own birthday is April 20--the anniversary of the Columbine shooting. "And actually, now that I think of it, my father was born on January 8, which was the day of the Tuscon massacre, and our dog Howie's birthday was November 5, 2009, the exact same day as the Fort Hood attack. I think the only person in the family who wasn't born on the day of a tragedy is my youngest son Eric." Sources added that Mason was dismayed to learn shortly thereafter that Eric's July 7 birthday actually coincided with the London bus bombing.
