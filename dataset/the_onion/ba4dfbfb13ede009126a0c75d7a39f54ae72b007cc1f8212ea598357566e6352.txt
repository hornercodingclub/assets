MIDFIELD--Highly placed sources on the offense, including an individual who is reportedly lined up under the center, are claiming to have conclusive evidence that the middle linebacker and one or both outside linebackers will blitz immediately after the ball is snapped. "Blitz! Blitz! Watch for the blitz!" multiple individuals at the scene were heard to say, suggesting that purposeful movement towards or up to the neutral zone had been observed. "They're coming!" Neither blocking nor ball-handling personnel had commented on their plans to either pick up or avoid the blitz as of press time.
