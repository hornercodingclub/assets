PHILADELPHIA--Throughout the runtime of the two-hour movie, local mother of three Barbara Rosenstock, 62, took several opportunities Friday to declare her hatred for the bad guy. "Oh, he's just being so mean to his girlfriend! That's terrible. It's just awful how he treats her!" said Rosenstock, gasping and shaking her head as the antagonist struck another character with a closed fist. "You don't hit! Why would he do that? It's so unnecessary. He's just being a jerk. You would never act like that, right? I hate people who behave that way. So mean." At press time, the mom announced "Oh, I like her!" upon seeing the film's female lead resolutely standing up to the bad guy.
