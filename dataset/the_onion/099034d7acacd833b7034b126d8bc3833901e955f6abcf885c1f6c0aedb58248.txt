RENTON, WA--Neighborhood witnesses confirmed Sunday that the McAuliffe's easy 7-year-old son Dylan always has a steady stream of going in and out of the family's house. "It seems like every weekend that little slut has another friend over: Anton, Darryl, Steph, Sam, Noah--I guess everyone's getting a turn," said neighbor Jennifer Cloye, 43, who claimed the first-grader must be working his way through all of Westbrook Elementary, considering how many of his classmates pass through the "friendship brothel." "Just the other weekend that whore brought home three friends at once for a sleepover. Can you imagine?" Sources also reported that the McAuliffe's older daughter Kim, 17, was a cold, closed-legged prude.
