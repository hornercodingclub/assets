NEW YORK--Conceding that they could not imagine anything more satisfying, sources closest to Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll admitted to reporters Thursday that they would love to see him get blown out in a Super Bowl. "Honestly, yeah, it'd be great to watch him get trounced by like 20, maybe 24 points on Sunday," said lifelong friend Paul Tuchrello, expressing a sentiment similar to that of the rest of Carroll's friends and family members who confirmed that they are privately hoping the coach will be absolutely humiliated in the biggest game of his nearly 40-year career. "If the Broncos wrap this thing up in the third quarter and we get to watch Pete despondently roam the sideline for another 35 or 40 minutes, I'd be thrilled. I mean, if the Seahawks got shut out that'd be incredible, but I'd settle for pretty much any scenario where he helplessly watches as his team gets dismantled in front of a hundred million people." Those in Carroll's inner circle added that watching the Seahawks come up one yard short as time expired would also be enjoyable.
