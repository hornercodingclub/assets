DEDHAM, MA--Noting how the man grinned with satisfaction after his Buffalo Chicken Ranch sandwich with a side of spiced panko onion rings arrived at his table, sources at Chili's Grill & Bar confirmed Tuesday that local diner Matt Schoesse was very proud of the food he ordered. "I'm glad I got this," said Schoesse, who reportedly nodded with self-approval when the waitress set down the heavily laden plate, and subsequently took further delight in the reaction of a dining companion who singled out his meal by remarking, "Ooh, that looks good." "The menu has a lot of stuff, but I knew I wanted this one. This was a good choice to get." At press time, the pleased man was looking on with heartfelt pity at a woman in an adjacent booth who had made the mistake of ordering a less appealing entree.
