MOSCOW--Lamenting that internal disorganization was making it extremely difficult to get anything done, Russian officials voiced their frustration Thursday about continuing struggles to get policies through the dysfunctional Trump administration. "You'd think that after being in the White House for a month, they'd have at least some rudimentary process for rolling out our new proposals, but it's just been a mess so far," said Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, adding that the recent dismissal of Michael Flynn as national security advisor was "just the tip of the iceberg" in a chaotic White House where internal conflicts and numerous leaks made it hard for the Russians to implement any workable ideas at all. "Nobody, but nobody, knows who's in charge. If they're not dragging their feet getting our new legislative demands in front of Congress, they're rushing out some executive order before we've even finalized it. We don't know what's going on half the time, so how on earth are we supposed to get anything accomplished?" An exasperated Shoigu went on to say that the administration was in such disarray, rolling back sanctions might take a year longer than planned, and abandoning NATO might actually be out of the question.
