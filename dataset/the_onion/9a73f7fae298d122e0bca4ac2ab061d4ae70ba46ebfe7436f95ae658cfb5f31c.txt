--Silencing gossip in the media about her weight, singer and actress Jessica Simpson wowed crowds this weekend when she stepped out in Beverly Hills with a trim new figure, flaunting her slender frame for the first time since chopping off all her limbs in October. "Gurl srsly looks ah-mazing!" Hollywood blogger Perez Hilton wrote under photographs of the starlet being wheeled into a shoe store, reportedly a whole 80 pounds lighter than she was last month. "Paps snapped our girl de-stressing with some retail therapy, and mama is looking fabulous with her slimmed-down frame! We are so proud of you, Jess!" When reached for comment, Simpson said the process of taking off the weight was "easy, fun, and the best thing I've ever done for myself."
