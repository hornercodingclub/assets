An IndieGoGo project created by Gawker has reached its $200,000 goal, with the intention of purchasing a video from a self-proclaimed member of the Toronto drug scene that allegedly shows Toronto mayor Rob Ford smoking crack. What do think? "Meanwhile, my Kickstarter to just buy some crack stands at zero dollars." Todd Higgins * Moisture Tester "I'd be glad to send them a clip of my kid's principal smoking a cigarette at the football game." Leigh Boyle * Picture Frame Inspector "Even if the video doesn't exist, it just felt great giving money to Gawker." Bernard Ward * Lei Seller
