HOUSTON--In an effort to ensure the integrity of the NCAA Final Four, tournament officials announced Wednesday they had added a play-in game for Virginia Commonwealth University that, if won, would allow the Rams to continue on to the semifinals. "There are a lot of good collegiate basketball programs in the country, and we want to make sure the Final Four is comprised of the absolute best teams," NCAA president Mark Emmert said. "We think VCU's incredible story is what this contest is all about. That's why we can't wait to watch these student-athletes try to continue their Cinderella run against top tournament seed Ohio State." According to Emmert, should VCU win the play-in, defeat Butler, and triumph in the national title game, the Rams will then go to a "winners bracket" in which they will have to defeat all three of the other Final Four teams over and over again until the NCAA is convinced they deserve this year's tournament trophy.
