NEW YORK--The tension and unspoken hostility between Yankees manager Joe Torre and owner George Steinbrenner following the New York Yankees' elimination from the 2007 postseason created the most awkward bathroom encounter yet in their long association, men's room sources reported Monday. "George was already in [the bathroom] standing at the urinal, and when Joe opened the door and saw him, it was as if the room had the air completely sucked out of it," said office manager Derrick Glass, adding that the situation became more uncomfortable when, after realizing all the stalls were occupied, Torre was required to use the urinal next to Steinbrenner's. "They briefly acknowledged one another, but I would call their nods of greeting curt at best." According to Glass, the tension was broken ever so slightly when general manager Brian Cashman entered and attempted to put all present at ease by saying "So, this is awkward."
