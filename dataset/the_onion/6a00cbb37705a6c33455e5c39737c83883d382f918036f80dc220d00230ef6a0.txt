The AFC North-leading Baltimore Ravens were dealt a harsh blow Monday when defensive stars LB Ray Lewis (torn triceps) and CB Lardarius Webb (torn ACL) were ruled out for the rest of the season. What do think? "How can the league's 26th-ranked defense ever recover from this?" "This will only make the Ravens' playoff run to the divisional round that much harder." "Yeah, but as far as I can tell from the way football is covered, the only player who makes an impact on a game is the quarterback."
