WASHINGTON--In the wake of Prime Minister David Cameron's announcement that he would leave office following the United Kingdom's vote to exit the European Union, tens of millions of Americans expressed their confusion to reporters Friday about a system of government in which a leader would resign after making a terrible decision. "Wait, so he made a really awful choice with far-reaching negative consequences and now he's just stepping down to let someone else take over? What?" said Colorado Springs, CO resident Evan Austin, echoing the sentiments of citizens across the United States who were left struggling to understand why a democratically elected head of government would relinquish control simply because they had been shown to have made a spectacularly bad judgment call. "So he jeopardized the future of his country, and instead of spending the next several years remaining in power while trying to paper over his mistakes, he's just gone? Where's the part where he denies any wrongdoing or tries to blame somebody else? This is absolutely crazy." The American public noted, however, that they completely understood the part where voters who had made a demonstrably terrible decision continued to double down on it.
