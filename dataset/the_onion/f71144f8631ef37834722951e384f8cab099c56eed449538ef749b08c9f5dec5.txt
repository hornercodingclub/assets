DAVENPORT, IA--Continually claiming that he's "not up for stuff like that right now," local resident Andrew Hughes, 27, is apparently never in the mood to take part in things he's never done before, family and friends confirmed Friday. "Eh, that's not really for me," said Hughes, who regularly expresses a reluctance to engage in activities outside his normal routine of television, sitting, showering, bowling, going to work, playing video games, and grocery shopping. "I don't feel like doing it because it would make me uncomfortable. Seems kind of like a hassle." At press time, Hughes was reportedly feeling in the mood to do any of the eight things he's already done.
