SOCHI, RUSSIA--Engrossed by the competitive game's odd rituals and strange rules, Americans across the country reportedly expressed fascination Wednesday upon discovering the bizarre Olympic sport of hockey. "From what I can tell, it's this weird foreign ice sport with a lot of sticks, but it's really interesting watching everyone chase after this little black disc," said Bellevue, NE resident Lucas Castillo, 32, who was captivated by the strange intermissions when a loud siren blared, the competitors left the playing field, and a mascot entertained the crowd by driving a funny vehicle on the ice."I can kind of follow it, but I never really know what's going on. Players try to put the disc in the net, but they have to avoid crossing weird lines on the ice or something. It's one of those things that's fun to watch during the Olympics, but it's easy to see why it hasn't caught on like handball." Despite their mild interest in the sport, Americans unanimously confirmed that there's no way hockey could ever gain widespread popularity in the United States.
