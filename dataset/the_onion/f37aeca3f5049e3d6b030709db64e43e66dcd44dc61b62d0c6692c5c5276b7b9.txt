SALT LAKE CITY--In a move designed to help the metropolitan area attract more tourists, Salt Lake City officials unveiled a new advertising campaign Thursday reminding potential visitors that they can leave at any time. "With our new 'Free to Leave' campaign, we're letting the world know that when you visit Salt Lake City, you can get out whenever you want, day or night, whether you've only been here for a couple of hours or a couple of days," Mayor Ralph Becker said, emphasizing that the city's main attractions are all conveniently located near train stations, airports, and a number of major highways. "The award-winning Hogle Zoo, Red Butte Garden and Arboretum, the Natural History Museum of Utah--these are all places you can up and leave any moment you please. And as you stroll through world-famous Temple Square, you can rest assured in knowing that, if you just hop on I-80, you can be in Nevada in about 90 minutes." The city's tourism officials added that if visitors don't feel like it, they don't even have to come at all.
