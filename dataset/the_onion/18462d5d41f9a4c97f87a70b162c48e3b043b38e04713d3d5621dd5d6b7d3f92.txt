Banksy's "Devolved Parliament" painting, which depicts the British House of Commons as chimpanzees, sold at a Sotheby's auction for $12.2 million, smashing the anonymous street artist's previous record of $1.3 million. What do think? "Nothing sticks it to the upper classes like being wholly embraced by them." Noel Levy * Catering Delegator "Enough with these inscrutable metaphors, Banksy. Tell us what you mean!" Adam Hodges * Assembly Scheduler "Whoever paid $12.2 million for that thing is getting ripped off. Parliament is made up of humans, not chimpanzees." Brandon Hale * Rock Climbing Guide
