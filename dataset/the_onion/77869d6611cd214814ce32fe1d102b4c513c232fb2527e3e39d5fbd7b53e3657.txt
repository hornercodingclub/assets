FOXBOROUGH, MA--Patriots owner Robert Kraft told reporters Thursday that he would prefer it if Tom Brady would sleep by his side for the entire night instead of leaving before Kraft wakes up. "Sometimes Tom and I will be so happy in each other's arms, but then he always makes some excuse about how he's got a busy day tomorrow and then suddenly he's gone at like three in the morning," said Kraft, insisting that he did not want to say anything that would push his starting quarterback away. "I know T-Bone is really busy, but I just want to be a part of his life. It hurts when you're looking forward to spooning someone and he's not around. It's not much fun eating breakfast in bed all by yourself." The owner reportedly expressed concern that Brady refused to spend the night because Kraft could never give him a baby.
