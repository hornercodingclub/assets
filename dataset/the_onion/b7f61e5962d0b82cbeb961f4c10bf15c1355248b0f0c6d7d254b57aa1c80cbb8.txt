Several groups, including the Texas ACLU, have voiced their opposition to Texas governor Rick Perry's participation in a day of Christian prayer and fasting this past weekend, saying it violates the separation of church and state. What do think? "Well, the Constitution does bar the establishment of a state religion, but it also guarantees an individual's right to the free exercise of superstition, so it's a tricky case." Marvin Blair * Systems Analyst "As long as it's Christian prayer, I don't think it violated the separation of church and state." Clarice Bernier * Glaze Handler "Why's everybody getting so worked up? All he's going to do is pray for stuff; it's not like anything is actually going to happen." Jerry Schuster * Rafter
