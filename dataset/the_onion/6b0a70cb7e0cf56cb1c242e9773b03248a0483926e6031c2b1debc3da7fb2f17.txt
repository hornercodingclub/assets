GREENSBORO, NC--According to sources, local boyfriend Martin Daniels was compelled to display secondhand outrage Monday as his girlfriend, Linzi Rosario, vented about a recent incident in which a coworker behaved inconsiderately toward her. "Ugh, I can't believe she did that," Daniels reportedly forced himself to say, employing a tone of disgust he hoped would convince Rosario he understood why she was upset. "You're right. She was way out of line. I remember you saying she's done that before, and it's awful that she did it again. I'd be mad, too. I mad." At press time, with Rosario continuing to detail her coworker's behavior, sources said Daniels had decided he should go ahead and spend the next five seconds or so shaking his head to convey a sense of commiseration.
