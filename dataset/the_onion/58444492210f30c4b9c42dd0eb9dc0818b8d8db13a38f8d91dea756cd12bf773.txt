NEW ORLEANS--After Sunday's devastating loss left a once vibrant New Orleans football team in a state of total disrepair and all 53 Saints players despondent, awash in despair, and bereft of any hope for salvation, members of their fanbase have decided not to abandon their devastated team and to instead offer support in their time of extreme need. "Mere weeks ago this was a great football team, and it will rise up and be great once again," Ninth Ward resident Darius Jenkins said. "Some may say this disaster was inevitable, that the team should have been prepared for a collapse after seeing the warning signs the week before, but this is not a time to live in the past. We must support them as they rebuild." Beleaguered Saints quarterback Drew Brees said Monday that he hopes the tragic events that transpired inside both Raymond James Stadium and the RCA Dome will never happen again, adding that the sights and sounds were "ghastly," "appalling," and "showed professional football at its worst."
