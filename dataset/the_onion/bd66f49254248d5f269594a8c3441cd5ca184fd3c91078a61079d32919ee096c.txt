WASHINGTON--Fully mindful of the privilege he enjoyed, Trump administration staffer Greg Potreski told reporters Friday that he was grateful to be working with so many individuals he could turn over to the FBI in exchange for immunity. "It's such an honor to be surrounded by almost countless people who, if it ever came down to it, I could hand over to the authorities in order to escape prosecution," said Potreski, adding that he never imagined he'd find himself in a workplace that was staffed wall-to-wall with professionals whose comparatively more serious crimes he could expose to save himself. "I've held positions in government before, but I've never had an experience like this--there's an opportunity for me to do no jail time in every single office. I learn so much just by talking to these folks." When asked by reporters, Potreski's colleagues said they were equally grateful to have someone like him at work.
