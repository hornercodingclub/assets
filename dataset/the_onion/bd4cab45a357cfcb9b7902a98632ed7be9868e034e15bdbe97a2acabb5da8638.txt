COTTONWOOD HEIGHTS, UT--In a broad push to offer new content to the website's millions of customers, executives from online retailer Overstock.com officially announced plans Tuesday to develop a slate of original online programming. "We're incredibly excited to finally enter the arena of producing high-quality original entertainment, and we look forward to creating some great new comedy, drama, and children's series that will make Overstock.com a true player in the original programming game," said Overstock's vice president of original programming Daniel Schulte, adding that the wholesale retail outlet has already begun production on a 13-episode run of a single-camera situational comedy starring Jason Schwartzman. "Among our new projects is an hour-long crime drama series developed by and creator David E. Kelley, and we've also greenlit a full season of a psychological thriller starring Tim Roth as a homicide detective in a small town in Tennessee. All of these incredible new programs and more will be available to stream exclusively on Overstock.com." Schulte also confirmed widespread fan speculation that Overstock is currently in the process of acquiring the rights to produce an all-new sixth season of the recently canceled NBC sitcom .
