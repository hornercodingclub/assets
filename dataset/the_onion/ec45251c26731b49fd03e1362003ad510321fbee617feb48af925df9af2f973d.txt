DECATUR, IL--Expressing relief that he would not have to construct an entirely new diatribe from scratch, local man Harold Willis was reportedly pleased Monday to discover that most of his anti-Hillary Clinton rant from the mid-1990s was still perfectly usable. "I got rid of the stuff about her '93 health care plan, but besides that and a few other tiny fixes, there was still lots of good material," said Willis, adding that once he updated it with a couple Benghazi details and a quick tag about the recent controversy over the presidential candidate's State Department email server, the well-worn harangue would be good as new. "I figured out I could just replace the part about her being a frigid woman with how she's just another corrupt Washington politician, so that was an easy fix. I'll probably tighten up the Whitewater section a bit, but unless there are any big surprises during campaign season, this should easily last through the election." At press time, Willis happily realized he could simply recycle the allegation that Clinton conspired to murder Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster without changing a single word.
