MIAMI--Applying an analytical framework dating back to 360 BC, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan used the concept of infinite divisibility Thursday to argue that, in theory, no team could win the NBA championship. "Given that an initial field of nonzero size is halved by each round of playoffs, it follows that one may make an arbitrarily large number of such divisions, each time yielding another field of nonzero size," said Duncan, diagramming his arguments in marker on a dry-erase board for his teammates. "Imagine, if you will, a basketball approaching a backboard from 8 feet, then 4 feet, then 2 feet, and so on. Now ask: When is the ball halfway there? This is my point: that the ball is always halfway there, and continues to be so. I know this is all very abstract, but you understand what I'm saying. The NBA playoffs behave asymptotically, approaching a zero limit but never reaching it." Duncan then asserted that, assuming the dimension of time is similarly divisible, tonight's Game 1 tip-off would never occur.
