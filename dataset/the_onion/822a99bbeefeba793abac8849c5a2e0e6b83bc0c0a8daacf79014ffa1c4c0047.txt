CORAL GABLES, FL--Saying that she had given the decision considerable thought, local high school senior Katie Simmons told reporters Monday that she would be applying to Bristol College, a school where her family had donated funds for a new 50,000-square-foot library. "There are so many great choices out there, but I feel like I should at least consider Bristol," said the 17-year-old, noting that while she would like to go somewhere that has a strong academic reputation and a vibrant social scene, it couldn't hurt to apply to the institution where her family handed over the largest single gift in the school's history to construct a new state-of-the-art library and digital media center. "Bristol's a pretty good school, and I could definitely picture myself there, so I guess there's no harm in filling out the application, right?" Simmons added that she was keeping her options open by also applying to the school whose president plays golf with her dad once a month.
