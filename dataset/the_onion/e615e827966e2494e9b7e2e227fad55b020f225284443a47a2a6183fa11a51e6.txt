CHICAGO--Despite calling himself a close friend and confidant of the late Chicago Bears superstar, remarks made by former Bears quarterback Vince Evans last week while being filmed for a documentary movie revealed that he has no idea that Walter Payton had passed away, as Evans several times referred to the Hall of Fame running back in the present tense. "Walter is just a fantastic all-around guy," said Evans, who somehow had never learned of Payton's death from their ex-teammates or by glancing at any newspaper on November 2, 1999. "I know he's got a busy life, but he has a magnetic personality and a real mind for the game, and we'd all love to see him get into coaching. He has so much to offer young players." Evans, who said that it seemed "like forever" since he last talked to Payton, announced that he would call "his good buddy Sweetness" immediately after the interview.
