GRAND RAPIDS, MI--Tossing and turning way past his beddy-bye, delicate little man Jeremy Palazola was reportedly unable to sleep Tuesday night because he drank a teensy bit of coffee after four o'clock. "I'll have a cup in the morning sometimes, but that's usually it," said the precious flower, who tried and tried to keep his eyes closed but remained wide awake from the itty-bitty beverage he had 10 hours earlier. "I knew I shouldn't have had any during the afternoon meeting, but I was just feeling so out of it." At press time--oh no!--the darling little angel was getting a big tummy ache.
