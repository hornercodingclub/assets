DETROIT--With three rounds and the championship game remaining in the 2009 NCAA men's basketball tournament, documents believing to be the script for the season finale have been leaked to several websites, including The Smoking Gun, Ain't It Cool News, and Deadspin. "The NCAA has no comment on the authenticity or version-status of anything you may have seen," a press release issued by the tournament committee and signed by the tournament's writers and producers read in part. "We ask fans across the country to ignore anything they hear concerning basketball's final episodes and invite them to tune in no matter what they may have heard. What they see will still surprise them." Reactions to the script were diverse but emphatic, with sizable numbers of fans strongly protesting the shocking death of UNC, the logic-defying return of Wisconsin, and the revelation that Xavier has been an angel team since the first round.
