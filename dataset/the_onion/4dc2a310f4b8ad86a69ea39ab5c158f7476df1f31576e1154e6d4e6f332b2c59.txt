CHICAGO--Iconic Bears middle linebacker Brian Urlacher officially announced his retirement from the NFL Wednesday, despite acknowledging that he still had "a lot of injuries left in the tank." "I've decided that now is the time to end my playing career, even though I'm very confident that I could continue suffering injuries at a high level for a couple more seasons," Urlacher wrote in a statement to reporters, adding that his decision largely hinged on the fact that he could no longer get hurt playing for the Bears. "I'm still very much capable of going out there and straining my hamstrings, fracturing the bones in my arms, and tearing my knee ligaments. And there's no doubt in my mind that I could be listed as questionable for 16 games next season, but after 13 years in the league, my choice to retire is final." Urlacher went on to thank the Bears organization and fans, claiming that he will "never forget" the time he spent on the team's sidelines last season.
