ATLANTA--TNT basketball analyst Charles Barkley took time during last night's broadcast of to lash out at the National Basketball Association's Hall of Fame selection committee for choosing to induct former Suns forward Charles Barkley. "He only averaged 22 points, 11 rebounds, and four assists for his career," Barkley said, shocking co-hosts Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith. "Anyone can do that. Hell, even I could do that." Barkley also noted that Barkley moved around to several teams, retired long after he should have, and is "most likely only getting inducted because of his personality." "I like a funny guy," Barkley said, "but I don't want to be a part of a league where somebody gets into the Hall of Fame just because he can crack a joke." Inductee Charles Barkley refused to address Charles Barkley's remarks, saying only that Barkley should focus more on the facts rather than blatant editorializing.
