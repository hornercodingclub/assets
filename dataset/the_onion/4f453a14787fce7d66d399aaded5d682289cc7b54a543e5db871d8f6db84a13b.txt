INDIANAPOLIS--Praising the veteran quarterback as "a man who changed the game of football forever," reporter Kyle Bowman reportedly poured his little heart out Monday in a column about the retirement of Peyton Manning. "I have long dreaded the day when I would finally have to say this goodbye, but let me begin by saying that covering Peyton has been the greatest privilege of my professional life," read an excerpt of Bowman's glowing 3,800-word tribute, in which he gushed that Lucas Oil Stadium is "The House That Peyton Built." "Peyton Manning has meant more to the fans and community here than anyone could ever put into words, and this city owes him a debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished during his 14 years in a Colts uniform. Number 18 will always be our quarterback." Bowman then finished baring his undying love for Manning by concluding the piece with a single line reading "Thank you, Peyton."
