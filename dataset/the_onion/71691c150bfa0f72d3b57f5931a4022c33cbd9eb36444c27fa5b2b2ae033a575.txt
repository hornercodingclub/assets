LAS VEGAS--Despite an impassioned 20-minute post-game speech by Eastern Conference coach Flip Saunders last Sunday about commitment to team ideals, playing with passion, and the need to get back to fundamentals, his All-Star team has decided to go its separate ways following the 153-132 blowout. "Guys, come on, we can't just give up," Saunders said while players packed up their bags and got ready for their separate flights back to their home cities. "There is more talent in this room than that scoreboard suggests. We can only improve with time, and I really think that if we learn to play together rather than as a group of individuals, there's every chance we could make a legitimate run at this thing." Eastern Conference All-Stars guard Dwayne Wade said he wouldn't rule out the chance of seeing his former teammates at some point in the future, but somehow doesn't think he will ever play with Caron Butler or Dwight Howard ever again.
