NORMAN, OK--Noting that similar outcomes were achieved under both approaches, a landmark decade-long study of mental health treatment options published Tuesday has found that talk therapy and antidepressant medications are equally effective at monetizing clinical depression. "Our data indicate that regular counseling sessions and prescription drugs have similarly high success rates in generating large sums of money from the clinically depressed," said Katherine Hutton of the University of Oklahoma, the study's lead author, noting that both methods demonstrated consistent positive earnings across chronic, episodic, and seasonal depression cases. "While some people make tremendous profits with drugs, others see substantial revenues from therapy. Together, these are two very powerful tools for improving the health care industry's bottom line." The study concluded that when both approaches are combined, financial results are likely to be reached far more quickly than with one method alone.
