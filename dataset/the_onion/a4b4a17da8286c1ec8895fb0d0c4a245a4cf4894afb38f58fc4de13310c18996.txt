SANDY SPRINGS, GA--In an effort to honor the widely admired first lady, fast-casual chain Arby's announced Wednesday that they're releasing special edition curly fries packaged in a carton with the late Barbara Bush's face alongside the words "In Remembrance" written tastefully in cursive. "We're excited today to pay tribute to America's beloved idol by adding Barbara Bush Memorial Curly Fries for a limited time only to our iconic 'Friends Of Meat' sides menu," spokesperson Lauren Davis said of the item, which will be seasoned with a special blend of smoked paprika, spicy BBQ, and Old Bay as an homage to the 92-year-old's zesty wit. "When we heard about her passing, we knew we had to fire up the grill and pay tribute. And that's just what we did, creating a delicious, crave-able add-on just as dynamic and fulfilling as the long, beautiful life led by our favorite presidential wife and mother." Davis added that customers of the fast-casual chain can look forward to pairing the fries with the upcoming George H.W. Bush Memorial Dipping Sauce, which will be hitting stores very soon.
