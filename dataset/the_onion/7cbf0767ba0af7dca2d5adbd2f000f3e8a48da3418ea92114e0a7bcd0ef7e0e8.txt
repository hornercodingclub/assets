CHESTERFIELD, MO--Steeling himself for the long journey ahead, local man and father of three John Cantrell reportedly bid a tearful farewell to his family Thursday, expressing good wishes to his loved ones prior to the commencement of the 2013 NFL season. "Deborah, kids, it looks like I'll be going away for a while," said Cantrell, adding that, following the kickoff of the season-opening matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and the Denver Broncos, his family wouldn't see or be able to contact him for the next five months. "I know it's going to be tough, but, hey, I'll be back before you know it. Now don't you cry, Josh. You're the man of the house now. I need you to watch out for your mom and sisters, okay? God, I love you all so much." As in past years, depending on the performance of the St. Louis Rams this season, sources noted that Cantrell might actually return to his family in as little as eight weeks.
