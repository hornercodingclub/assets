CINCINNATI--Saying that "oh, I just thought it was so powerful" and "Dad loved it too," local mom Deborah Ward informed family sources this week that she loved the film . "It was so sad, but so, you know, well-made, and the acting was just--I mean, I cried," said Ward of the film, which reenacts the final hours of 22-year-old Oscar Grant's life before he was tragically killed by a BART police officer, and which the 57-year-old mother of two confirmed is "based on a real story that happened." "And the main actor in it is just wonderful. He's almost sort of like a young Denzel Washington type. He's very handsome, too. You really feel bad for him and his daughter." Ward added that "I'm seeing it again with Audrey on Friday."
