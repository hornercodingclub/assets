CHICAGO--Explaining that he is breaking from his normal routine for Game 1 of the World Series, 32-year-old Chicago Cubs fan Frank Sanford confirmed Tuesday that he feels ready to get completely drunk again on only two days' rest. "I usually need at least four or five days off between getting blackout drunk, but it's the World Series, so I'll do whatever I have to do to get out there and get absolutely wasted tonight," said Sanford, adding that he used Sunday and Monday to rest and recover following his 12-beer outing during the Cubs' NLCS-clinching win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday. "I did some light drinking yesterday and felt okay, so I think I'll be good to go. I might not be able to drink as much as I normally could after a full week's rest, but I'll go hard and throw back as many beers as I can. There's no way I would miss an opportunity to get totally hammered when my team is in the World Series." Sanford added that he is hoping to avoid a repeat of Game 4 of the 2015 NLCS, when he was taken out of the bar by his friends after throwing up twice on just eight shots in the first four innings.
