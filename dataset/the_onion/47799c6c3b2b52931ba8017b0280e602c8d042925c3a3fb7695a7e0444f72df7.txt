WILLIAMSPORT, PA--Hamilton West Side's shortstop Tyson Baker, 11, was ejected in the fourth inning of Saturday's Little League World Series game after arguing with the umpire over a controversial call that Appa the flying bison was the best character on . "What are you blind? Aang is totally better," said Baker, who kicked dirt on home plate and threw his bat down the first-base line. "That's such bullcrap. Aang can make a ball of air and sit on it to fly around. Appa is just a flying cow. You're such an idiot that you probably liked it when Aang and Katara kissed." The umpire reportedly decided to toss Baker from the game after the 11-year-old accused him of wanting to be best friends with Fire Lord Ozai.
