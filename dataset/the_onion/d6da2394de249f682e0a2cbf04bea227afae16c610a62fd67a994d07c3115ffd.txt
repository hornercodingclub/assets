LOS ANGELES--Unexpectedly penning lyrics about colorful autumn foliage and summer cottages on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers accidentally wrote a song about New Hampshire, sources reported Friday. "We just got into the studio and started jamming, and for whatever reason, we just ended up with this track about the Granite State," said lead singer Anthony Kiedis, adding that he had no idea he and his bandmates had anything say about the pumpkin festival in Laconia "until we grooved on it a while." "It's definitely not the direction we intended to go in, but Flea started slapping this funky bass line that got everyone thinking about the pristine waters of the Piscataqua River. Before I knew it, I'd already freestyled two verses about how freaky it is that the state doesn't have a sales tax." At press time, the band had unintentionally recorded an entire double-length New England-themed concept album.
