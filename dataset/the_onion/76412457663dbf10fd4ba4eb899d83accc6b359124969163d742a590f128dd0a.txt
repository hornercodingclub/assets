LOS ANGELES--ESPN programming executives announced Wednesday the debut of a new show called that will air afternoons on ESPN and evenings on ESPN2 and which will consist of an attractive blonde host reading tweets and Facebook comments to the camera for a half hour. "This new show will tap into the real conversations taking place across social channels and then literally repeat those conversations back to people," said Jamie Horowitz, vice president of original programming. "We are confident that a beautiful, flaxen-haired young woman flirtatiously reading short, easy-to-digest messages aloud is exactly the kind of innovative programming that the discerning modern sports fan demands." After several rounds of test marketing, the collected data suggested that has the potential to become the most popular program on the entire ESPN family of networks despite frequently veering completely off the topic of sports.
