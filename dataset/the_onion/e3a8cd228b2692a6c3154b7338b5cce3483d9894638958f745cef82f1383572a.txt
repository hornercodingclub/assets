JUNEAU, AK--Saying it was clear the parents never intended to have such a large brood, sources confirmed Wednesday that the Greene family has way too many daughters for them not to have been trying for a son. "Obviously, after Jess and Katie, they started to get desperate for a boy, otherwise they wouldn't have had Ashley," said family friend Lisa Contreras, who noted that the Greenes showed no signs of stopping even though they were both nearing 40 and had daughters in daycare, elementary school, and middle school. "I thought for sure they'd be done once Sophia was born, but then a year and a half later, along came Charlie. For everyone's sake, I hope the fifth time's the charm." Sources later confirmed that the Greenes had posted a photo of pink balloons on Facebook to announce their latest pregnancy.
