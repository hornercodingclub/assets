NASHVILLE, TN--Motivating the masses to participate in the democratic process with her popular Instagram post, pop star Taylor Swift reportedly inspired 200 million fans from all over the country this week to register to vote in Tennessee. "Taylor hasn't really talked much about politics over the course of her career, but she's certainly making waves now," said Tennessee Democratic Party chairperson Mary Mancini, who applauded Swift for "getting her message out there," as well as helping to register the entire population of the state more than 30 times over. "We've never seen anything like this--definitely not in a 24-hour period at least. Ms. Swift has truly inspired young people from Maine to California to leave everything behind and head for a polling place in Tennessee this November. She's even galvanized young people living in other countries to vote in these important midterm elections as well." At press time, Tennessee officials announced that Election Day voting hours would be extended by one hour to accommodate 60 percent of the world's population now expected to cast a ballot.
