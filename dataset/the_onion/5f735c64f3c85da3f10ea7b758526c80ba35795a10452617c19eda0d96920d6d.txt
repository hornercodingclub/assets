FREMONT, CA--Claiming that he just wanted to do something malicious to her, committed abuser Matthew Strachan, 29, surprised his girlfriend at her office Thursday with an unexpected threat, workplace sources confirmed. "I figured I would stop by unannounced during my lunch break with a few promises of physical violence, just to let Mallory know how much I've been thinking about hurting her," said Strachan, adding that his girlfriend was completely surprised by his open display of antagonism at her desk in the middle of her workday. "Her face went completely red as soon as she saw me, so you could tell she totally didn't see it coming. And before I left I whispered a little something hostile in her ear just to make her feel really unsafe for the rest of the day." Strachan also confirmed that he was planning some "very special" abuse for his girlfriend when she returned home that evening.
