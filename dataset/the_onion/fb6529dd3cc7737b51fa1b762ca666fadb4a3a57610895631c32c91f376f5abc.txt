LA CROSSE, WI--Ambushing the party official in an empty parking garage as he exited his office, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly grabbed an unpledged Democratic superdelegate and threw him into the trunk of her car during the late night hours Monday. "Maybe this will help you make up your mind," said Clinton, who raised a tire iron above the head of the voting member of the Democratic National Convention as he lay cowering in the vehicle's storage compartment, his blubbering pleas for help muffled after she slammed the trunk lid. "Keep your fucking mouth shut and don't do anything stupid." At press time, Clinton was holding a phone up to the superdelegate's head and instructing him to inform an AP reporter that the former secretary of state would protect and build on the achievements of the last eight years.
