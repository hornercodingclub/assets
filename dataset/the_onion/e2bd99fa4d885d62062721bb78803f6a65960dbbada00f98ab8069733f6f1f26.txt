WASHINGTON--Saying he would "make a killing while catching rays," Vice President Joe Biden confirmed Friday he had lined up a "totally sweet" summer gig installing above-ground pools around the D.C. metro area. "It's gonna kick ass--three whole months of workin' on my tan, crankin' tunes on my boombox, and bird-doggin' bored housewives," said Biden, adding that his buddy Thomas "Lil' Loco" Perez hooked him up with the plum job in which "you can totally get away with smoking up while on the clock." "I don't know dick about pools, but make no mistake, Uncle Joe can figure out that shit. They've got me in charge of my own crew, so I don't really have to do jack. Plus, I can haul around all the pool junk in this rusty-ass, loud-as-fuck pickup truck I borrowed. It's gonna be a bitchin' summer." Biden told reporters that he pulled a few strings to get paid under the table until he cleared up "some tax bullshit," explaining that any wages on the books would be garnished by "those IRS fuckers."
