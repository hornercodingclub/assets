NEW YORK--Telling reporters that "we must prepare for the future," commissioner Roger Goodell announced Thursday that the league would begin collecting sperm samples from all players for the NFL's new breeding program. "Each player shall submit to mandatory weekly collection of genetic information, in accordance with new league protocol," said Goodell, who noted that resistance to the program "will not be tolerated." "Empty capsules shall be distributed on Tuesday. The player shall fill the capsule with semen and return it on Wednesday, at which point it shall become the sole property of the NFL. All of this is necessary. The league will survive." Goodell then cryptically added that two players from each of the NFL's 32 teams had already been selected "to serve as the vessels."
