PHILADELPHIA--According to team sources, members of the Philadelphia Eagles' staff were "incredibly troubled" Friday after new starting quarterback Nick Foles began asking about the most effective ways to tear an ACL. "I was a little confused when out of the blue Nick asks me about the best way to suffer a serious knee injury, but I became really concerned when he asked if there's a particular popping sound to listen for when the ACL snaps," said Eagles head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder, adding that the rookie quarterback asked him several times to physically demonstrate the precise twisting motion required to "totally rip the ligament to shreds." "The whole time he kept saying he was just curious to learn about the body, but then he asked if there was an easy way to also tear the PCL and MCL at the same time, and specifically whether that would sideline a football player for at least a couple months. It was all very worrying." At press time, a smiling Foles was reportedly being carted off the team's practice field.
