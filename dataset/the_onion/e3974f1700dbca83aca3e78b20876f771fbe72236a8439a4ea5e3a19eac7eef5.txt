BRISTOL, CT--Explaining that the premise was directly inspired by last night's presidential debate, ESPN executive vice president John Walsh told reporters Wednesday about his brand-new idea for a live TV show in which a black man and a white man furiously talk over each other while ignoring a countdown timer. "My idea is this: We give the black guy and the white guy a list of topics they'll need to discuss during the show, and just like last night's debate, they can just go off on each other with zero regard for the two-minute clock we'll put on the screen," said Walsh, explaining that the timer's only purpose will be to elevate the tension when the men continue speaking after it hits zero. "The vehement black man and the vehement white man will have such big personalities, and think their ideas are so important, that nobody will be able to stop them from speaking, not even this one guy who I'm imagining hangs off to the side and occasionally tells them what they got wrong." After watching some more election coverage, Walsh reportedly began sketching plans for a feature on ESPN.com that would allow people to cast meaningless votes on issues they know very little about.
