Head coach Mike Brown has been fired by the Los Angeles Lakers, who have started the season with a conference-low 1-4 record despite adding Steve Nash and Dwight Howard to a roster that already includes Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol. "Maybe another massive distraction that keeps their team under a microscope for another few weeks is exactly what this team needs?" "Teams that fire Mike Brown have not traditionally done well." "Five games in and not a single championship? I'd fire him too."
