Former astronaut Sally Ride, who in 1983 became the first American woman to travel into space, died in her San Diego home yesterday at age 61. What do think? "It's a shame. No astronaut should outlive their space program." Bonnie Osgood * Watch Assembler "Sally Ride taught me women can do anything and it's not a big deal at all." Matt Rauchut * Dry Cleaner "Well, I still think that female astronaut who drove 20 hours or something with diapers on ought to be ashamed of herself." Aaron Linnell * Soils Engineer
