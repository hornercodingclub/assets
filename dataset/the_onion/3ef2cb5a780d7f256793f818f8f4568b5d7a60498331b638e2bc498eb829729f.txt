NEW ULM, MN--Admitting that he could hardly even recognize her, local 12-year-old Ethan Harrelson was reportedly surprised Monday by how much bigger his aunt Judy Stohl had gotten since the previous year. "Oh, my, look at you--you were just about half this size when I last saw you. What's Uncle Peter feeding you over there?" said a visibly amazed Harrelson, adding that he could barely wrap his arms around his 56-year-old aunt to give her a hug. "Wow, looks like your old clothes are barely fitting you. At this rate, you'll probably be as big as Grandpa the next time I see you!" At press time, Harrelson could be overheard marveling at how it looked like Stohl even had a bit of a mustache coming in.
