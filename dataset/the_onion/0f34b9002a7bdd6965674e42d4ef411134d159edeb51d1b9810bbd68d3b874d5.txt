A jury awarded $7.2 million in damages to a man diagnosed with "Popcorn Lung," a respiratory disease he may have developed from inhaling a chemical in artificial butter flavoring during a decade in which he ate two bags of microwave popcorn a day. What do think? "Wow, that must have been some decade!" Miles Corkery * Edge Sander "Did he mention what brand it was? If he was eating that much, it must be pretty good popcorn." Randy McGlone * Phone Book Deliverer "He should have read the warning about keeping the product well away from one's nose and mouth." Marilyn Cheshire * Wharf Attendant
