WASHINGTON--A new report published Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board advises motorists that sending text messages while driving "is totally fine" and "not that big a deal" as long as you make sure to glance up from your phone every now and then. "If you're driving and have a really important text to send, that's okay; just try to keep one eye on the road as best you can," NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman said of the report, which advocates a new "50-50 rule" for texting drivers, suggesting they keep half their attention on the road and half on their handheld device. "After all, you can always steer with your knees or--if you really want to be extra careful--text with one hand and hold the wheel with the other. Better yet, just ask a passenger to give you a heads-up whenever there's a red light or another car up ahead." Hersman added that the report's findings apply not only to texting, but also to checking email, playing games, or watching movies while driving.
