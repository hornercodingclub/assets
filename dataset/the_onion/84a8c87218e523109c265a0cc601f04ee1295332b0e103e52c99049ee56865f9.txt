NEW YORK-- Despite the fact that the season is well over a month old and league standings are starting to take shape, Major League Baseball experts confirmed Monday that it is still way too early. "Lots of baseball to be played between now and October, folks," leading baseball analysts, commentators, and writers have repeatedly said this week, adding that the World Series isn't won in May. "At the All-Star break maybe we can talk a little more seriously." Professional analysts stated that while there is still plenty of time, it is too late for the Minnesota Twins.
