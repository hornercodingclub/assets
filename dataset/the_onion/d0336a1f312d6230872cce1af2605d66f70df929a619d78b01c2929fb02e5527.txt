APOPKA, FL--Local man Jeremy Land reportedly voiced his preference Thursday for comic books that don't insert politics into stories about people forced to undergo body- and mind-altering experiments that transform them into government agents of war. "I'm tired of simply trying to enjoy escapist stories in which people are tortured and experimented upon at black sites run by authoritarian governments, only to have the creators cram political messages down my throat," said Land, 31, who added that Marvel's recent additions of female, LGBTQ, and racially diverse characters to long-running story arcs about tyrannical regimes turning social outsiders into powerful killing machines felt like PC propaganda run amok. "Look, I get that politics is some people's thing, but I just want to read good stories about people whose position outside society makes them easy prey for tests run by amoral government scientists--without a heavy-handed allegory for the Tuskegee Study thrown in. Why can't comics be like they used to and just present worlds where superheroes and villains, who were clearly avatars for the values of capitalism, communism, or fascism, battle each other in narratives that explicitly mirrored the complex geopolitical dynamics of the Cold War?" At press time, Land was posting on a subreddit that he wished comics didn't force him to identify with gay or black superheroes when all he wanted was stories about oppressive governments rounding up mutants whose only crime was to be born different.
