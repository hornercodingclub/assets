HOUSTON--Texans placekicker Kris Brown used a three-hour practice Thursday to work on placekicking, sources reported. "Just did about 30 minutes of placekicking, so now I'm gonna take a break and then do a little more placekicking," Brown was overheard saying to no one in particular. "Placed the ball a bunch. Kicked it a bunch. Think I'm good with placekicking for the day." Brown reportedly startled his wife that night by wondering briefly if he had forgotten to practice placekicking that day.
