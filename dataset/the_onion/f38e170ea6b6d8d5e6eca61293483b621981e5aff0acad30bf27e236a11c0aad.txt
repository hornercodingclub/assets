Former Disney Channel star Zac Efron will reportedly play Ted Bundy in an upcoming film about the serial killer who murdered at least 30 women in the 1970s. What do think? "Say what you will about murder, but it's a good way to get a movie made about you." Derek Hamann * Darts Referee "Efron should know the way to be taken seriously as an actor isn't stunt casting; it's an untimely death." Steven Custer * Screw Threader "What a great way to connect with a whole new generation of Bundy fans!" Samantha McNulty * Unlicensed Veterinarian
