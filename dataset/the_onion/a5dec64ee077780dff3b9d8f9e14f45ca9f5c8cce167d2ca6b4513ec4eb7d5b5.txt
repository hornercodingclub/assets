NEW YORK--Following Major League Baseball's decision to suspend the Yankees third baseman for 211 games, 9-year-old Alex Rodriguez fan and utterly repellent little asshole David Polaski expressed his heartbreak Tuesday that he won't be able to see his favorite player in action until 2015. "I love A-Rod--he's the best, and now I don't get to watch him at all," said the insufferable and entitled little prick, who sources confirmed has absolutely no friends and is hated by virtually everyone who knows or has ever met him. "The MLB is stupid. A-Rod's the most awesome player ever. This sucks." The repulsive, self-absorbed brat added that he's just glad he can still watch his second-favorite player, Yankees relief pitcher Joba Chamberlain.
