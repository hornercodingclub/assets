DALLAS--Describing him as both "creepy" and "kind of a weirdo," Fox NFL color commentator Daryl Johnston admitted Wednesday that he does not feel comfortable being alone in the broadcast booth with play-by-play partner Kenny Albert. "Whenever there's a pause in the action, all I'm thinking about is how badly I want to get the hell out of there," said Johnston, adding that he was disconcerted by Albert slowly rocking back and forth while licking his lips and emitting small giggles at seemingly random intervals during every commercial break."There's something off about him. Occasionally, without warning, he'll move over close enough so that our thighs are just touching, and then he'll stare straight ahead with this big dumb grin on his face. It's really unsettling." Johnston added that he is equally disturbed by Albert's unwavering insistence that they book adjoining hotel rooms.
