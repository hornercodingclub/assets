SAN FRANCISCO--In a sparsely attended press conference Monday, veteran left-fielder Barry Bonds, son of former Giants great Bobby Bonds, announced his retirement from the game of baseball with his legacy and dignity intact. "I know I'm only 22 home runs shy of breaking the record, but to me it was never about the numbers, and always about coming to the ballpark each day and having fun," Bonds said. "Hopefully, I've made a small impact on this sport." Bonds went on to thank the players, fans, press, and all of Major League Baseball for "making this experience a truly memorable one."
