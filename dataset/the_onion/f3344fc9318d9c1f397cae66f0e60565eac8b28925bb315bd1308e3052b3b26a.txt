Performing after the band Big & Rich at a Romney rally last night, Meat Loaf offered the candidate an unusual, rambling endorsement in which the 65-year-old rocker mentioned that he had never been involved in politics before, that the Cold War is not over, and that "Paul Ryan has not pushed [him] off the cliff in a wheelchair." What do think? "Congratulations, Mitt, on your sweatiest endorsement yet." Lucas Groom * Marine Machinist "He makes a good point, but I think, in a lot of ways, the Cold War is over." Patricia Rosenthal * Vocational Adviser "Did Big & Rich by any chance mention who they were supporting for president?" Dennis Nykvist * Systems Analyst
