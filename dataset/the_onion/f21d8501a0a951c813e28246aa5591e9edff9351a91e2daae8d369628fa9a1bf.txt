PHILADELPHIA--Praising the product as an effective and convenient means of helping individuals quit smoking, pharmaceutical manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline announced Wednesday the release of its new NicoDerm eye patch. "These discreet and easy-to-use eye patches allow users to curb their cigarette cravings by delivering a steady flow of therapeutic nicotine directly into the bloodstream through the optic nerve," said company spokesperson Caitlin Timmons, adding that the user simply removes the backing from the patch and applies the adhesive layer directly on their exposed cornea. "Individuals can choose to place the patch on their left eye or right eye, and the extended-release technology will reduce withdrawal symptoms for up to 72 hours. We recommend, however, that users don't put on more than one at a time." Officials told reporters that the NicoDerm eye patch might cause side effects such as trouble sleeping, burning at the application site, and poor depth perception.
