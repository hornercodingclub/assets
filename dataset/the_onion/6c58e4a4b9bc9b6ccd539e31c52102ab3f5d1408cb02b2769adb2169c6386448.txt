After receiving widespread backlash, the NRA has pulled an installment of its NRA News segment in which a U.S. Navy Seal argues that blind people should be allowed to carry guns just like everyone else, asking, "Do you think you need to see where you're shooting if someone is on top of you, trying to kill or rape you?" What do think? "If the NRA wasn't known for its tireless work with the blind, this might make it seem like they were trying to exploit them." Marshall Gradwell * Systems Analyst "This is just like the NRA, backing down at the slightest hint of controversy." Beth Spriggs * Content Aggregator "Great. Now a bunch of blind people are going to get assaulted." Michael Sanders * Sandpaper Maker
