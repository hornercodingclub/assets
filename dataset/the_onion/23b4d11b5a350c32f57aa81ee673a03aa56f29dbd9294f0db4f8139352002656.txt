PHILADELPHIA--Readily admitting that everything you're saying makes a lot of sense, Greenwave Media accounts manager Bryan Mellis confirmed on Wednesday that he totally gets it. "Listen, I completely see where you're coming from--we're a hundred percent on the same page here," said Mellis, adding that, honestly, he's just as frustrated as you are--if not more so--and that you're not the only one on the team who feels this way. "Believe me, I'm hearing you loud and clear, and I know full well that something needs to be done, no question about it." Mellis went on to say that, while he totally understands your discouragement, his hands were tied at the moment, so you'll just have to tough it out for the time being.
