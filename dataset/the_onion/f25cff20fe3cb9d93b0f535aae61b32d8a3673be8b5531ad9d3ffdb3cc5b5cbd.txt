PHILADELPHIA--New Philadelphia 76ers executive vice president and former Knicks head coach Larry Brown announced yesterday that plans to trade secretary Eileen Gerard, 63, due to her inability to conform to his style of collating. "I'm a teacher first, and if she is unwilling to see that I am trying to ultimately make her a better secretary, then she has no place in this office," said Brown, adding that he is aware that trading away the office's most popular assistant could do more harm than good in the short term. "I was brought in to turn this place around, and even though it may take a couple of years, soon our secretaries we'll be faxing and taking dictation the right way." According to various office managers throughout the NBA, there is very little interest in Gerard, as many believe she is planning to retire so she can spend more time with her grandchildren.
