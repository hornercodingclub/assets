CLEVELAND--In a locker room interview prior to his game against the Sacramento Kings Sunday, Cavaliers center Zydrunas Ilgauskas ruminated on his home country, guessing he might be from Romania or Croatia before finally concluding that he is probably from Turkey or someplace like that. "I'm not 100 percent sure, but players like me are usually from around Turkey," said Ilgauskas, citing his oddly shaped head and the mishmash of consonants in his first name as evidence. "I can't place my accent for the life of me. It's kind of Russian-ish, I guess, but Turkey's relatively close to Russia. So, yeah, Turkey." When informed that he is from Lithuania, Ilgauskas said that sounded about right, as Lithuania is probably a city in Turkey.
