WASHINGTON--Saying his latest executive order was legal due to an "underutilized but totally feasible workaround," President Trump claimed Tuesday that he could overrule the U.S. Constitution by means of the relatively obscure "no one will stop me" loophole. "My critics say a constitutional amendment or at least an act of Congress is necessary to end birthright citizenship, but what they don't realize is that a seldom-evoked administrative guideline ensures I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, because zero people will stand in my way," said Trump, adding that the largely unheard-of clause allows him to circumvent normal legal proceedings because it's not like anyone in any branch of government remains effective enough to prevent him from doing so. "Though few modern presidents have made use of it, this loophole has always given the nation's chief executive unilateral power over the Constitution. Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore." Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims.
