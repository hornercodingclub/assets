Cecil the lion, a popular Zimbabwe tourist attraction, was killed this week by Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer during a lion hunt he allegedly spent upwards of $50,000 to join, though Palmer has said he regrets his role in the incident and didn't realize Cecil was a famous lion when he killed him. What do think? "Usually it's the lions you don't kill that you end up regretting." Zac Dyson * Tractor Curator "Sounds like an honest mistake. From a distance, that lion probably looked like a total nobody." Ruby Long * Contract Performer "An American dentist paying $50,000 to kill an animal in Africa on a guided tour is simply nature taking its course." Terrence LeShea * Aquarium Washer
