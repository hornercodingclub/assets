SAN FRANCISCO--Joyously celebrating after his hometown team defeated the Kansas City Royals to clinch the championship, local 2-year-old Daniel Balane admitted to reporters Wednesday night that he never thought he would actually see the San Francisco Giants win a World Series in his lifetime. "I've waited my whole life for the Giants to win the World Series, and it's just so surreal to actually see it finally happen," said the 2-year-old toddler, adding that as far back as he can remember, the Giants have only been a mediocre National League team that couldn't even make the playoffs. "Deep down, I always held out some hope that it could eventually happen, but after waiting for so long, you start to think they'll just never get over the hump. So, when they finally won tonight, all that pent-up emotion just came pouring out. I still don't think it's fully sunk in yet. I mean, we did it--we're world champs!" Balane went on to say that the Giants' playoff run was the most exciting he's witnessed since watching the San Francisco 49ers make it to the NFC Championship Game all the way back in 2013.
