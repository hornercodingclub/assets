BETHESDA, MD--In a diabolical omission of the utmost cruelty, stone-hearted ice witch Leslie Schiller sent her friend a callous thank-you email devoid of even a single exclamation point, sources confirmed Monday. "Hey, I had a great time last night," wrote the cold-blooded crone, invoking the chill of a thousand winters with her sparely punctuated missive--a message as empty of human warmth as the withered hag's own frozen soul. "Nice to get together. We should do it again sometime." In a final flourish of ruthless savagery, sources reported that the barbaric gorgon concluded the email with a conspicuously single "xo."
