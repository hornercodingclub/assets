Streaming app Spotify is testing a new feature in Australia that allows non-paying users to skip an unlimited number of ads, allowing them to better track information about which ads users do and do not skip. What do think? "Okay, but paid users should ge t to listen to as many ads as they want." Sarah Stone * Talisman Operator "It's cool that Spotify found a way to treat their sponsors as poorly as they treat their artists." Douglas Henderson * Unemployed "Good. Advertising has gotten too commercial."  Lars Mathews * Sandal Repairman
