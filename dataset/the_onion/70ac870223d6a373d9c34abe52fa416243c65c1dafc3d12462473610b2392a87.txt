CHARLESTON, SC--Declaring that opening the nation's doors to displaced Syrians posed a major security threat, GOP leaders warned Tuesday that any refugees who resettled in the U.S. would most likely be driven to terrorism by the way America treats them. "We absolutely cannot provide a safe haven to these Syrians due to the very real threat that the abusive and hateful conduct of Americans will push the refugees toward radicalization and recruitment by extremist militant groups," said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), echoing the sentiments of numerous other presidential candidates and state governors who have argued that Syrian asylum seekers would in all probability embrace a radical jihadist worldview after constantly enduring anti-Muslim hate speech, racial epithets, and threats of violence and persecution by both the American people and government officials. "The moment we let these Syrians in, I promise that our most ruthless and cruel tendencies will take over, and we won't relent until these refugees feel like they have no choice but to plan and execute a terror attack right inside our borders. It's better to be safe than sorry in this situation." Cruz claimed that the country did not face the same threat from Syria's Christian refugees, stressing his confidence that only a small percentage of U.S. citizens would regard them as Muslim extremists.
