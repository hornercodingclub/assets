SARATOGA SPRINGS, NY--Unable to help themselves from eavesdropping on the interaction going on in the romantic corner behind them, diners at the Boca Bistro told reporters Monday that the couple fucking at the next table was obviously on their third date. "From the number of excuse-me's and little exclamations of surprise, you can tell they clearly don't know each other all that well yet, but it's pretty obvious this isn't their first date," said restaurant patron Alan Geiger, adding that it seemed the fornicating pair was becoming comfortable enough to actually enjoy themselves without worrying so much about impressing the other. "They're having a good time despite being at least a little nervous. Of course, they're stammering and fumbling around a bit, sure, and you can tell they're both worried about their hair, but there's no denying that the two of them have chemistry." Sources close to the couple confirmed they had a really nice time and are making plans to do it again sometime.
