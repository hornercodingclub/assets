In a landmark victory for digital privacy rights, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously Wednesday that police need to get a warrant before searching the cell phone of a person they've arrested. What do think? "It's always so exciting when a ruling is unanimous!"

Clint Bernard * Campground Maintenance Worker "That's right. If police want to browse through my cell phone pictures they can go to DougsBirdPhotos.tumblr.com like everyone else."
