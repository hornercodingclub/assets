LOS ANGELES--After a tumultuous and disappointing first half of their season, Kobe Bryant reportedly called a Kobe-Bryant-only meeting Thursday to air out the many issues still plaguing the Lakers. "There are 29 games to go and we're still under .500, so everybody needs to step their game up right now," Bryant reportedly said during the closed-door talks, which did not include coaches, upper management, or any of the other 13 players on the Lakers' roster. "I'm sick of hearing excuses about shoulder injuries or trade speculation. We should be contending for the title, but I feel like I'm the only one out there who even gives a damn. And frankly, that's pathetic." Reached for comment, Bryant told reporters the meeting was "very positive," as it was unanimously agreed that the 15-time All-Star should get more of the ball during games.
