A Democratic state senator and Republican city councilman were arrested today on charges they planned to rig the upcoming mayoral election in New York by bribing the city's top GOP leaders to allow the Democrat to run as the Republican nominee. What do think? "For punishment, I think they should elect him mayor of New York." Tate Diehl * Unemployed "It's refreshing to see a politician willing to reach across party lines to get things done." Linda Sebek * Feather Trimmer "This just goes to show that you can't buy political office. Unless of course they hadn't been caught, in which case they would have done exactly that."
