NEW YORK--Recent Wesleyan University graduate Zach Wallace confided to reporters Thursday that he has no clue how his parents are supposed to earn enough money to settle his $40,000 in student loan debt. "My God, they'll be lucky if they're able to pay this off while they're still in their 70s," said the 23-year-old film studies major and unpaid intern, noting the minimum monthly payments his father and mother will need to make just to keep their heads above water. "The student loan system takes advantage of a lot of parents who simply don't realize what they're getting into. Then four years later it's like, 'Welcome to the real world, Mom and Dad!'" Citing the present trend of tuition hikes and stagnant wages, Wallace added that his parents might well be forced into bankruptcy by the time he has completed a decent Ph.D. program.
