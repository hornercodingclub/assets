CHICAGO--Just days before the Blackhawks' first-round playoff loss to the Vancouver Canucks Wednesday, star right winger Patrick Kane announced to a stunned locker room that his father had taken a new job in Boise, ID and that he was moving away with his family. "I'm really sorry to do this to you guys right before the playoffs. I tried to tell my dad that this is where all my friends are and everything, but he just wouldn't listen," said Kane, confirming he would not be allowed to stay behind in Chicago and live with either his grandmother or Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz. "Maybe they have a hockey team in Boise and we can play each other someday." Before Kane left, each member of the team gave him a tearful hug, took down his family's new telephone number, and made a point of glaring angrily at Kane's father as he drove his family out of the United Center parking lot.
