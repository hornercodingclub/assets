NEW YORK--Citing the overwhelming success of the Jacksonville Jaguars, NFL officials unveiled plans Tuesday to add a second franchise in Jacksonville by the 2017 season. "Over the last 20 years, we've seen that Jacksonville, Florida is a city passionately devoted to professional football," said league commissioner Roger Goodell, adding that he believes the market in Jacksonville can easily sustain one, if not two or three additional NFL teams. "Obviously, the Jaguars have set a very high bar that would be difficult for a second team to surpass, but if the Jacksonville Pythons were to enjoy even a small fraction of the Jaguars' popularity, this would be a worthwhile investment." Officials revealed that to maintain inter-conference balance, the league would also add a team in San Diego, St. Louis, or Tampa Bay.
