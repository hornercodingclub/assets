Though urban myth dictates that spilled food is safe to eat if retrieved within five seconds, scientists have recently disproven this "five-second rule," explaining that contamination isn't determined by the length of time food spends on the ground, but rather the amount of bacteria present on the floor.

Dolores Rooney * Tombstone Polisher "Am I supposed to throw away this perfectly good soup just because it spilled all over the floor?" Vince Dudger * Lipstick Namer "Well sure, maybe a rich scientist can afford to drop $2.99 on a second trip to Speedway." Rick Sacks * Iguana Groomer
