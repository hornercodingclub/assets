CHICAGO--Saying she is now desperately searching for any options that will prevent her from being evicted, Chicago Sky forward and 2015 WNBA MVP Elena Delle Donne was reportedly left scrambling Thursday after her roommate moved out of their apartment without any warning whatsoever. "I really don't know what I'm going to do, because rent is due in two weeks and there's no way I can cover her $700," said Delle Donne, adding that, with her team commitments and offseason workout schedule, she barely has the time to interview anyone who may respond to the sublet listing she posted on Craigslist. "Not only am I out on her rent, but also her half of the internet and electricity bills. I might just have to move to a studio or someplace on the South Side, because there's no way I'm asking my parents for money again." At press time, a despondent Delle Donne was reportedly dragging a couple kitchen chairs into the living room to replace the futon that her roommate had taken with her.
