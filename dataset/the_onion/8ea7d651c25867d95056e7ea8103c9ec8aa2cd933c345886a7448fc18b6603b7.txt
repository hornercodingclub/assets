CHICAGO--Wearing a cardigan and a thin scarf, freezing woman Melissa Cady, 34, reportedly walked to work in frigid temperatures today following her decision that it is spring now. "The date is April 8 and it is now springtime and it is beautiful out," said the shivering, coatless woman as a gust of cold air blasted into her face. "Winter is over. The seasons have changed. I am happy and warm now." Sources said the woman spent her lunch hour walking along Lake Michigan, vigorously rubbing her hands together and blowing into them.
