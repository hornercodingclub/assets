PITTSBURGH--After noticing a newspaper article about the implementation of the upcoming Affordable Care Act, local father Andrew Panetta, 53, made an effort Monday to explain the intricacies of Obamacare to his son, sources confirmed. "It's bullshit," Panetta reportedly said, clarifying how insurance companies will comply with federal law in order to properly set up state-sponsored health care exchanges. "All of it. Complete and total bullshit." Panetta went on to conclude his seven-second explanation of the expansive new health care law by saying, "I'm telling you, it's bullshit."
