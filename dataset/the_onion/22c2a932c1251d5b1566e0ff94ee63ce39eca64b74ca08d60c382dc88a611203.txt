BOTTMINGEN, SWITZERLAND--Roger Federer, the world's second-ranked men's tennis player, expressed consternation Monday that he was unable to file his taxes on income earned in the U.S. due to a late 1099 form for the $1.5 million he was awarded for winning the 2008 U.S. Open. "I've already gotten the paperwork for every other U.S. tournament I was in last year: my semifinal finish in the Pac Life Open, quarterfinals in the Sony Ericsson Open," Federer said while pounding away at an adding machine from his home in Bottmingen. "It's not the money; I just want to get it over with, but I swear they do this to me every year. In 2005, I didn't get the thing until Apr. 10. The U.S. Open needs to get its shit together." Federer then began to panic over whether or not he had sent the Grand Slam tennis tournament a properly filled out 1042-S form.
