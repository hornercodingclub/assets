SALISBURY, MD--Repeating identical comments he had made in June, July, August, September, and twice in November, increasingly nervous local man Aaron Howe responded to Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Monday by once again stating this would be the end of the Republican frontrunner's campaign, sources confirmed. "Well, that's it--you just can't say those kinds of things and expect to be taken seriously any longer," said an anxious Howe, his voice quavering slightly as he spoke aloud the very same words he had previously uttered in reaction to remarks about Mexicans, women, the disabled, former POW John McCain, and a number of other targeted parties. "That's the final nail in the coffin right there. There's no way he's coming back from this one." At press time, a visibly tense Howe was steadily amassing the angst and exasperation that would be unleashed in his seventh expletive-filled exclamation of the year when he catches sight of the newest set of GOP poll numbers.
