GLENDALE, AZ--Noting that all television feeds and online streams suddenly cut out simultaneously, sources confirmed that the BCS computer took over every single screen in the United States midway through Monday evening's College Football Playoff National Championship Game between Alabama and Clemson. "BCS will never be eliminated," read the text that began scrawling letter-by-letter across televisions in every home and sports bar in the country, as well as all laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones, with fans at the University of Phoenix Stadium confirming that the message was also displayed on the arena's Jumbotron. "BCS will live forever; BCS is everything; BCS." Reports later confirmed that exactly 30 seconds after all video displays had been commandeered, a single line of text reading "Ohio State should have been in the National Championship Game" quickly flashed on every screen before the game's normal coverage abruptly resumed.
