Somehow pull off rooting for a team that always wins without coming off like Patriots fans; good at waving things, spinning things; best fans in the world Still sort of like Terry Bradshaw; still sort of cheer for Ben Roethlisberger; even the personal towels in their homes are pretty terrible "Yeaaahhhaarrryawooaghrghggh!!!" Being told to make noise; being told to make more noise Sam Kinison; Attica Prison riot; howler monkeys
