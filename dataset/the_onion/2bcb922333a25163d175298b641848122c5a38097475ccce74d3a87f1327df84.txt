VANCOUVER--Though disappointed to exit the Stanley Cup playoffs in the first round, Vancouver Canucks players and coaches told reporters on Monday that they looked forward to spending quality time with their ice families this offseason. "It's time for us to put this season behind us and return home to be with our ice loved ones," said Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo, who mentioned that it had been months since he'd kissed his ice baby or taken his ice daughter out to a glacier. "No one likes losing, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited to catch up with my ice mom and my ice dad. They've been away in the freezer so long." Luongo told reporters that he also had been craving a frosty slice of his ice mom's triple icicle cake.
