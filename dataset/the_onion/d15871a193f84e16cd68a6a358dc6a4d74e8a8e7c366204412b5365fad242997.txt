LOS ANGELES--Explaining that their goal has always been to hold a mirror to society, whether focusing on the power of friendship or a racially motivated killing, the writers behind the hit children's television series defended a recent episode of the show Friday in which a German shepherd "police pup" shoots an unarmed black lab 17 times in the back. "What we tried to do in 'Paw-lice Bru-tail-ity' was use Chase's gunning down of a weaponless Zuma to start a dialogue," staffer Louise Moon said of the storyline in which a bigoted Cap'n Turbot reports a "thuggish black dog" for loitering in his gated community moments before Chase arrives, mistakes Zuma's bone for a gun, and shoots indiscriminately at the fleeing canine while shouting his signature catchphrase, "These paws uphold the laws!" "The fact is that whether they're 2- or 11-years-old, our viewers are smart enough to decide for themselves whether Chase's family and career should be ripped apart just because of a split-second decision. Our job is just to represent the political moment--from the violent Antifa protests to Chase's PTSD-fraught leave of absence--using the only medium we have, and I believe we did that." At press time, the writers remained silent about the episode involving the deportation of thousands of Chihuahuas accused of stealing jobs and crippling Adventure Bay's economy.
