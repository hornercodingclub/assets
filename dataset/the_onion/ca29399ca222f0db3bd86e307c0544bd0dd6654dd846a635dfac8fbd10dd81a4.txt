CHARLOTTE, NC--Despite having just met the middle-aged couple earlier that afternoon, local wedding photographer Bob Dennison kept referring to the bride's parents as "Mom" and "Dad" throughout the Lambert-Carrillo wedding Saturday, sources reported. "All right, I need Mom and Dad standing right here in front of the rosebush. Perfect, Mom--Dad, I'm going to need you a few steps over this way," said the man who was hired over the internet and had no biological relationship to the family whatsoever. "Great, now let's get one with Mom and the boys, and then one with just Dad and the boys. By the way, can someone go grab me Grandma?" The photographer--who had no preexisting connection, either personal or professional, to any member of the wedding party--was later observed calling the groomsmen and bridesmaids by nicknames he had assigned them and, without asking, leaning in and lightly adjusting the groom's hair.
