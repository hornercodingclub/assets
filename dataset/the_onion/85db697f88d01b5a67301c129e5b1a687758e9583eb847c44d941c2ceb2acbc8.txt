WASHINGTON--Emphasizing that the commander-in-chief might want to get a head start on such a project soon, architect Owen Levin presented President Obama with generic options for a national memorial Tuesday that could feasibly honor an American war in Syria, Libya, or Yemen. "Our idea centers around a polished 30-foot Vermont marble panel that can either be inscribed with an image of servicemen trudging through a desert landscape, various military units' coats of arms, stirring quotes about giving one's life in defense of freedom, or any combination thereof," said Levin, describing how his idea for a chain of bronze wreaths wrapping around a rectangular limestone base could work for each one of these conflicts, or all three. "We've also included a reflecting pool in the design that is ringed with placeholder names of battle sites, but these can easily be swapped out for Tripoli, Tikrit, Sana'a, Mosul--whichever ones you need." Levin added that the flexibility of the memorial's height allows it to hold anywhere from 2,000 to 200,000 soldiers' names.
