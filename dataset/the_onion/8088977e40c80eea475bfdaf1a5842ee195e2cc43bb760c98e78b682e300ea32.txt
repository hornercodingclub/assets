KANSAS CITY, MO--Providing a brief warning before the footage began playing, several lines of text that preceded a three-minute video clip from a police officer's body camera reportedly informed viewers Monday they were about to see pretty much exactly what they'd expect. "Warning: This video contains precisely what you think," read the text that appeared against a black background for several seconds at the start of the video, cautioning those watching that they could not, by this point, claim to be surprised by what they were about to witness. "You've all seen enough of these, so you know the drill by now. Okay, here it comes." The message concluded by warning viewers that this, sadly, would not be the last video like this they'd ever see.
