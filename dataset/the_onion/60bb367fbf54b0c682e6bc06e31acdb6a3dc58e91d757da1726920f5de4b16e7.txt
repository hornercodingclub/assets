"Ah, college basketball season. The best three weeks of the year." "You can't put 65 closely ranked teams in a tournament together! Just think of all the outcomes! It's mad I tell you! Mad!" "Hopefully there are no upsets and all the favorites win by no less than 20 points. My heart simply can't take it."
