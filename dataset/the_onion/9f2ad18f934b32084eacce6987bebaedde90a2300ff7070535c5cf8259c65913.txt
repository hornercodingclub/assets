SEATTLE--Citing "subtle notes of ethambutol and clindamycin," longtime McDonald's customer Chris Hingle reported Thursday that he could discern from the taste of his McChicken sandwich a definite change in the antibiotics the fast food giant uses in its poultry. "This tastes way less ciprofloxacin-y than the McChicken did a year ago," Hingle stated after two bites of the crispy dollar-menu item. "It's good and all, but I really wish they'd bring back the old macrolide blend with the dirithromycin and troleandomycin. That's the taste I grew up with." Hingle later added that the Wendy's restaurant chain "seriously needs to find a better thickening and gelling agent" if it hopes to sell him another Frosty.
