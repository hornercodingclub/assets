RICHMOND, VA--Putting the fears of coaches, fans, and the organization to rest, Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III reportedly assured team doctors Thursday that he can barely even feel his reconstructed right knee. "Really, guys, my knee is totally fine; honestly, it's been completely numb for weeks," the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year told Redskins medical staff inquiring into the status of his surgically repaired ACL and LCL ligaments, emphasizing that he "can't feel a thing from [his] hip on down." "As far as I can tell, it's almost like there's nothing there at all. Maybe a tiny, shooting phantom pain every so often, but, really, I'm feeling great. Can't wait for the season to start." According to clubhouse personnel, in order to further assuage team doctors' concerns, Griffin then demonstrated the improved flexibility of his knee by bending the joint backwards and touching his toes to his chest.
