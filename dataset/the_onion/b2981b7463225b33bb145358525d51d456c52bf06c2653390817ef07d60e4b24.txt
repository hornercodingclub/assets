Donald Trump has stated publicly multiple times that he may not accept the results of the presidential election if Hillary Clinton is named the victor. Here's what would happen if Trump refuses to concede. A: As per the Constitution, each candidate is allowed to take their supporters and start a new country. A: While experts are divided, a lifetime spent never hearing the word "no" from anyone is probably a good guess.

A: Not technically, since the individuals causing property damage and starting fires will most likely be white. A: If you haven't already been horrified for the last 16 months, there's probably no point in starting now. A: Candidates wishing to dispute the outcome of a national election must file a motion with the District of Columbia Small Claims Court between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., weekdays.
