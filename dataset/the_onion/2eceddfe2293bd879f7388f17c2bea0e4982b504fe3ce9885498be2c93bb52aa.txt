NEW YORK--Saying the company has received hundreds of resumes since posting the job opening to its website earlier this week, Goldman Sachs human resources manager David Browning reported Thursday that a high-level position with the investment bank had attracted applications from every official in the United States Treasury Department. "Within just minutes of listing the open position on our jobs page, the flood of applications from treasury.gov email addresses started rolling in, and it hasn't slowed down since," said Browning, adding that most of the Treasury regulators who applied for the job highlighted their previous experience working closely with Wall Street financial firms and included a letter of recommendation from former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. "All these applicants must realize what tough competition they're up against, but at the same time, I remember how it was back when I was just another government official who was ready to make the move to the private sector. We'll definitely keep the information of those candidates who don't get the job on file for future openings." Browning added that the new hire was needed to take over the responsibilities of a former Goldman Sachs executive who had recently left for a high-ranking position in the Securities and Exchange Commission.
