BALTIMORE--Despite well over a decade of futility before their hot start this season, the Baltimore Orioles, currently tied for first in the AL East, told reporters Thursday they trust in one another and believe they have enough talent this year to win five more games. "This is a special Orioles team," said manager Buck Showalter, confirming he believes fans can pencil in the Orioles to carry a .045 winning percentage the rest of the season. "With a few more fluke home runs from Adam [Jones], some bad umpiring calls going our way, and the kind of random chance we've come to depend on, I have no problem at all saying we can take five of our next 111 games." Team members however were quick to caution that their chances of winning five games could be jeopardized by unforeseen circumstances, such as injuries or the franchise getting demoted to AAA.
