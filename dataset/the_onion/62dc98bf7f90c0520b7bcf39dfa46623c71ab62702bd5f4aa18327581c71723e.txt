OKLAHOMA CITY--Despite the team having brought itself to the Western Conference finals on the strength of weeks of brutally productive and disciplined play, visitors were reportedly startled to find there was a mood in the Spurs locker room following their elimination from the playoffs Wednesday night. "Yes, definitely, there is a mood in here tonight, and I'd have to say it's a predominant mood," Spurs guard Tony Parker told reporters, the general tone of the room reflected in his expressionless face. "But tomorrow is a new day, and we're not going to let that mood affect us going forward." Spurs coach Gregg Popovich later asked reporters to leave, admitting there was a certain tone present in the locker room, but claiming the team would not allow it to develop into an atmosphere or, worse yet, a feeling.
