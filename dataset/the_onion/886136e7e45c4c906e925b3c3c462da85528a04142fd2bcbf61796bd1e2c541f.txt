ORLANDO--Although many NBA analysts are saying the more talented and defensively dominant Cavs are certain to win the Orlando-Cleveland series, Magic players and coaches are confident that LeBron James and his supporting cast can be out-basketballed. "I really think we can basketball better than they can over the course of a long series. We already basketballed better than they basketballed in two games this year," Magic head coach Stan Van Gundy said. "We have to concentrate on basketballing patiently on offense and not over-basketballing it when we're under our own net, meanwhile taking advantage of their tendency to under-basketball on transitions. So, if we're smart and stay composed, then, yes, these guys can certainly be out-basketballed." Van Gundy would not comment on whether or not his team would be outscored.
