APPLETON, WI--Perplexed local man Russell Chambliss has no idea if the coworkers seated with him at Malone's Irish Tavern are attempting to forge a male bond with him or cruelly harassing him, the 26-year-old shipping clerk told reporters Wednesday evening. "When Bill called me 'limp dick' and punched my shoulder, I wasn't sure if he was insulting me or just being friendly, but everyone else was smiling and laughing, so I smiled back," said Chambliss, adding that he has also been called "fucker" several times, which feels like bullying even though the whole group seems to be referring to one another as "fucker." "I wish I could figure out whether I'm being included or excluded. When Jeff burped loudly in my ear while I was playing pinball, I was torn between storming off angrily and buying the next round. And when they asked how my 'piece of ass' was doing, I couldn't tell if they were trying to compliment my wife or were just being degrading." At press time, the group was reportedly exiting the bar as one of Chambliss' coworkers said, "See you next time, pussy," leaving him to wonder whether they actually wanted to hang out with him again or were just being sarcastic.
