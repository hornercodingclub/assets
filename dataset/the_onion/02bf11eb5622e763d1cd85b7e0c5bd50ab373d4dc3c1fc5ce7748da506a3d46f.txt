SARASOTA, FL--After more than 30 years in the broadcast booth, Fox Sports MLB commentator Tim McCarver announced his retirement last week in an incoherent, largely unintelligible speech. "Well, when you, uh, get to my age, there are two options: retire or keep going. And so that's what I'm gonna do," said McCarver in his rambling, muddled farewell, in which reporters suspect the veteran sportscaster expressed gratitude for his fellow broadcasters, "the sport of baseball," and "the great man of Bob Selig" [sic]. "The thing about Tim McCarver--that's me--is you've gotta appreciate a guy going out like that. And respect the game. Which is what I think I'm doing here, and that's what I think people will, uh, believe he's doing. And do it the correct way. Right, Joe?" Though McCarver ranks as one of baseball's most recognizable media personalities, early reports indicate that most fans remain unaware of his retirement, as they have become accustomed to subconsciously tuning out everything the analyst says.
