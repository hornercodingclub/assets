GLENDALE, AZ--Having defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday night to win Super Bowl XLIX, the New England Patriots reportedly provided an incredible storybook ending to the NFL's credibility. "Honestly, you couldn't have scripted it any better in a movie," said ESPN analyst Adam Schefter, adding that after a year rife with scandal--including high-profile domestic violence cases involving Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, the league's ongoing concussion epidemic, and fresh allegations of cheating against New England--seeing the Patriots celebrate a fourth Super Bowl title was a fitting end to the NFL's integrity. "Given what we've seen over the past six months, this is the perfect way--really the only way--for it to finish. Unbelievable." Sources also confirmed that witnessing a smiling Roger Goodell hand the Lombardi Trophy to Patriots owner Robert Kraft was just the cherry on top after watching the final few seconds of the NFL's dignity and self-respect tick away.
