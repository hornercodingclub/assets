WASHINGTON--Expressing concern over his increasingly combative behavior and refusal to cooperate with others, sources confirmed this week that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who comes from a troubled home state, has been frequently acting out in Congress. "His home state must be a very unhealthy environment, given all the unsettling and sometimes outright hostile things he says," said Senate Sergeant at Arms Frank J. Larkin, suggesting that perhaps a lack of financial stability or positive mental stimulation in his home state had left him with considerable cognitive and emotional deficits. "He can be all right for a while, but then he'll attack other members of Congress with little provocation. Sometimes he doesn't even show up at all. And it seems like every time he goes back to his home state, he just returns here in a worse state of mind and then takes it out by trying to ruin legislation. I feel sorry for him, sure, but at the same time, he's extremely disruptive." Several Senate sources said they hoped the conditions in Sessions' home state improved, admitting that they were worried the troubled 69-year-old would end up in prison.
