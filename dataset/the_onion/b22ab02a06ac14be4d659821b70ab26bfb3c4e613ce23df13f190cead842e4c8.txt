Presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sparred over subjects including foreign policy, the economy, and their fitness to hold the nation's highest office in the final debate Wednesday. The Onion examines the validity of their assertions: There are, in fact, bad people living in the United States. Although specifically directed at Trump's view on the validity of national election results, this remark could reasonably describe any event over the past 16 months. It's unclear whether Trump was referring to Clinton, one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, or one of the millions of other American women he has serially insulted and disrespected, but in any case, it is false. Look, we've definitely fact-checked this one already. We're not doing it again. The American people have already decided this country will be a bitterly divided one. Undoubtedly true. National pride ceased existing sometime around the fourth month of this election. Actually, jobs in the field of fact-checking have skyrocketed. This is true, although Trump failed to mention that the prairie falcon has also been known to feed on lizards and is the only large falcon species found exclusively in North America. False. He'll keep everyone in abject terror.
