NEW YORK--Multiple reports from within the New York Yankees clubhouse confirmed Saturday that team officials have warned shortstop Eduardo Nunez to stop showing up injured team captain Derek Jeter by making routine plays in the field and at the plate. "Every cleanly fielded ground ball sends a pretty strong message that Eduardo is trying to upstage Derek," said Yankees manager Joe Girardi, who blasted Nunez for having the audacity to turn a double play without a throwing error, claiming the commonplace display of physical capabilities clearly reminds fans of Jeter's advancing age and declining skills. "He needs to just cut it out; he's making Derek look bad. Last week, when Eduardo legged out an infield single, that was like a direct slap in the face to our team captain." Girardi, however, lauded third baseman Kevin Youkilis for helping everybody forget that Alex Rodriguez is still on the team.
