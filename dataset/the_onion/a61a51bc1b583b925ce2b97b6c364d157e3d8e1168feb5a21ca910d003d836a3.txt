INDIANAPOLIS--Scandal rocked the college football community Monday as allegations surfaced that the head coach of a major Division I program may have accepted monetary compensation for his involvement with the team. "We are currently investigating claims that a college coach received semi-monthly payments totaling in excess of $1 million from his school's athletic department last year," the NCAA said in a statement, noting that the coach was also alleged to have accepted performance-based bonuses including housing, health care, a free parking spot, and other impermissible benefits. "Such actions run directly against the NCAA's principle of amateurism and--if the charges prove true--will be met with swift punishment ranging from fines to forfeiture of wins and a two-year postseason ban." NCAA officials confirmed that the school's athletic director is also under investigation.
