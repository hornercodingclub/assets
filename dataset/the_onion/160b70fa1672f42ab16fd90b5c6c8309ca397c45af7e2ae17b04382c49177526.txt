CLEVELAND--Rookie quarterback Brady Quinn agreed to a five-year deal worth $20.2 million, including $7.75 million in guaranteed money, with the reluctant Cleveland Browns Tuesday, despite the team's hopes that Quinn would hold out through the first part of the season. "Last week, negotiations seemed stalled at about a half-million apart, and we were very comfortable with that amount," Browns GM Phil Savage said. "It's unfortunate that it got done so soon, but at least Brady wasn't here for the crucial first few days of camp." Head coach Romeo Crennel said that, while the almost certainly overrated Quinn's signing was unfortunate, there is still ample time for Quinn to suffer a season-ending injury during an exhibition game.
