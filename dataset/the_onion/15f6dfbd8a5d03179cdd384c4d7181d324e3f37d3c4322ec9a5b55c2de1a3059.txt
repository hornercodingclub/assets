BOSTON--Saying the film exposes director Kenneth Strable's total lack of pacing, editing, and cinematography skills, critics and viewers alike have called the newly released documentary a "scathing indictment of the filmmaker's creative abilities," reports confirmed this week. "Right from the outset, this film explores the dark underbelly of this so-called auteur, unearthing the ugly truth about his grasp on everything from sound design to storytelling," said film reviewer Ella McNareth, who noted that after sitting through the damning expose's silent five-minute opening shot of an abandoned factory, she would "never look at this director the same way again." "Certain scenes are extremely hard to watch, and you're left feeling awful for anyone who played a part in its making. But as disturbing as it is, this documentary is required viewing for anyone who wants to fully understand how unqualified this director is." McNareth added that perhaps if enough people were to see the documentary, Strable might never be able to make another film again.
