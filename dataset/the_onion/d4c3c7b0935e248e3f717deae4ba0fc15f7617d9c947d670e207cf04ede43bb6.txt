After several recent cases of air traffic controllers falling asleep on the job--including one incident that delayed the landing of a medical flight--the Federal Aviation Administration announced it was adding more overnight controllers at 27 towers. What do think? "An air traffic controller fell asleep at Ronald Reagan National Airport? I thought he fired all those lazy union bums." Diane May * Systems Analyst "It's a real Catch-22. If their job were more exciting, then they wouldn't fall asleep. But if they didn't fall asleep, then they wouldn't misdirect planes and make them crash. Catch-22." David Taylor * Unemployed "Lucky them. I can never sleep through a flight." Ward Deacon * Salesman
