Martin Purvis * Baccarat Dealer "Nothing good ever came out of Massachusetts in a vial. Except that genuine Michael Dukakis sweat on eBay. Man, I wish I could afford that." Bunny Cottrell * Decontaminator "Wow, I didn't know steroids were a form of vaccines or that meningitis was a form of autism!" Jean-Pierre Soto * Carnival Attendant
