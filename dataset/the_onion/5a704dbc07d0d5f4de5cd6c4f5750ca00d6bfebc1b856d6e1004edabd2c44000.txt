"Our sweet and savory Marshmallows 'N' Gravy Pizza is the only meal that can satisfy the hunger of the nation's highest office," said a spokesperson in a new Little Caesars television spot, which aired several times during Thursday morning's episode of and featured multiple slow-motion close-up shots of thick brown gravy cascading onto a marshmallow-covered pizza while "Hail To The Chief" played in the background. "With dozens of perfectly toasted Jet-Puffed marshmallows bathed in rich sausage gravy and finished with crispy Cool Ranch Doritos crumbles all atop a large Classic Pepperoni pizza, our newest taste sensation is the perfect choice for a diplomatic lunch, state dinner, or when you get that late-night 3 a.m. hankering while checking social media. And with Little Caesars restaurants conveniently located throughout the D.C. and Palm Beach metro areas, you can have a slice of Marshmallows 'N' Gravy Pizza whenever you like."
