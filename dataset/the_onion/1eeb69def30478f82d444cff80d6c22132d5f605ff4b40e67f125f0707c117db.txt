NEW YORK--Calling the 16-year-old international free agent "the next great general manager," the New York Yankees announced the signing of the Dominican Republic's Eduardo Morales Monday. "We've had our eye on [Morales] since he was a vice president of baseball operations for his youth league team," said Yankees' scouting director Damon Oppenheimer, who appointed the prospect as general manager of the Single-A Staten Island club. "This is a five-tool general manger we've got here: free agent contract negotiation, trading, drafting, Rule 5 drafting, and ballpark administration. And he's certainly not afraid to shake up a roster. As they say in the Dominican, you don't stand pat at the trading deadline to get off the island." As for the disappointing performance of current general manager Brian Cashman, Oppenheimer announced he would be put in a strict platoon with assistant GM Jean Afterman and may soon be relegated to pinch-general-managing duties.
