DUBLIN, OH--Responding to consumer demands for healthier offerings, Wendy's announced this week the addition of its new Fit 'N' Fast menu, which features food that customers bring in from home to eat at the restaurant. "People still love Wendy's classic old-fashioned hamburgers and Frosty desserts, but they also want to have fresh, low-calorie options, so we've decided to incorporate a variety of wholesome items that our diners prepare themselves," said Wendy's deputy marketing director Ralph Jones, telling reporters the fast food chain was proud to be including a wide assortment of heart-healthy, vegetarian, and nutritious homestyle choices for the very first time. "At each of our more than 6,500 locations, we'll be making room for everything from lentil soup to mixed greens to baked salmon, all hand-selected by customers from their own refrigerators and brought directly to a table at Wendy's." Jones went on to state that with any Fit 'N' Fast meal customers could add fries and a 24-ounce soda, if they're being honest with themselves.
