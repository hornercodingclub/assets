KANSAS CITY--Calling it their chance to finally hit the big time, booking agent Freddie Holt announced this morning that he had landed the Kansas City Royals a major gig in New York City this August. "This is it, fellas: the big leagues!" said Holt, who promised that instead of the "crappy" Midwest venues they've been doing for months, the team would be "playing in front of thousands of screaming fans in The Big Apple." "Everyone's gonna be watching you. There'll be big lights, TV cameras--maybe even a reporter for ! So, don't blow it, or you'll be back here in Kauffman Stadium before you know it." Players were reportedly disappointed to learn the gig was actually in Queens and not Manhattan, but agreed that playing on the East Coast at all was "still a huge deal."
