WASHINGTON--Confirming that the probe successfully entered orbit around Mars late Sunday night, NASA officials reported today that the Maven spacecraft was now set to begin its mission of taking thousands of high-resolution computer backgrounds. "In its first year alone, the Maven probe will capture several hundred crisp desktop wallpapers of the Martian landscape in previously unattainable detail," said NASA scientist Bruce Jakosky, noting that the space probe's sophisticated instruments would ensure the backgrounds were in resolutions up to 1920x1200 and large enough to span two side-by-side monitors. "Maven has already taken preliminary images of the Bonneville crater, and we can confirm they look absolutely beautiful under a grid of desktop icons or protruding from the edges of a browser window." According to Jakosky, after collecting enough computer backgrounds, researchers hoped to extend Maven's mission and begin capturing images for a comprehensive Mars screensaver before the probe exhausts its fuel and crashes into the Martian surface.
