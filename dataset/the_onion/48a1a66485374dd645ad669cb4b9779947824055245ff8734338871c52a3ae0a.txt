ATLANTA--In an unprompted act of generosity from one coworker to another, Spryte Logistics employee Ben Graham reportedly took the initiative to share one of Emily Fehrman's ideas with their boss on Friday, saving her the time and effort of doing it herself. "When I offhandedly mentioned to Ben a new way the company might save on shipping, I in no way expected him to shoulder the burden of telling it to our supervisor--but that's just the helpful kind of guy he is, stepping up to take all the credit without me even having to lift a finger," said Fehrman, 34, adding she was beyond grateful to have been spared the 10-foot trip to her boss's office to explain the idea and receive praise in person. "Thanks to Ben, I won't have to worry about any performance bonus that might result from my creative thinking, and I can just continue to focus on the same day-to-day work." Fehrman, who has not been promoted in eight years, went on to say that she was particularly fortunate that her department was staffed with plenty of men just as helpful as Graham.
