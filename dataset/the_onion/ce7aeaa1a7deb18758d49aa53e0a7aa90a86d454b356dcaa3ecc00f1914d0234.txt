WASHINGTON--A U.S. Department of Agriculture report published Monday revealed the average American consumes 156 pounds of sugar a year but would, ideally, prefer to ingest a far greater amount. "To be honest, 156 sounds pretty low," said Milwaukee-area consumer Curt Jenkins, 35, whose feelings are shared by an overwhelming 87 percent of U.S. citizens who participated in the five-year, $200 million study. "That's not even a pound a day. I think if we worked at it, we could double that number. I know I personally could eat a whole lot more, and I'm sure others could, too. I mean, sugar's the best! Have you tasted it? It's really good." The report follows last month's finding that Americans take an average of 5,117 steps per day, a distance 96 percent of survey respondents agreed was "way farther than anyone should be walking."
