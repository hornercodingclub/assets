SAINT ALBANS, VT--Describing it as a terrible tragedy that has sent shockwaves throughout the region, sources confirmed Thursday that a hit-and-run driver struck and killed a prominent member of the local deer community. Reports indicate that the respected and popular white-tailed doe, who was widely regarded as a generous, loving mother of two fawns, was returning home at dusk when she was hit by a driver in an SUV who immediately fled the scene after the fatal accident. "This is a difficult day for everyone in the thicket; seeing such a model deer cut down in her prime is heartbreaking," said a local buck, adding that the upstanding doe had been a pillar of the deer community who was known to show genuine altruism and provide support to the herd during times of hardship and scarce foraging opportunities. "Just yesterday, I saw her rooting around for acorns. And now she's gone. I'm still struggling to believe this is real." "She was just so full of life," the buck continued. "It's hard to imagine the forest clearing without her." "I don't know how anyone could run her down in their car and then just leave her lying there on the side of the road. We're never going to forget her." Sources confirmed that the close-knit deer community is currently reeling from the painful loss, with many saying that the recently passed doe touched numerous lives with her warmth and gentle nuzzles. According to local woodland residents, the doe will be remembered as a friendly deer who enjoyed tender buds, loved streams, bounded through the forest with great energy, and was always willing to share a soft patch of grass with fellow deer looking for a place to rest. Sources stated that the hit-and-run incident that prematurely claimed the doe's life was particularly devastating, as the beloved and loyal doe had reportedly helped keep up morale during last year's harsh winter, especially on one memorable occasion when she led the group to a grove with edible cedar bark. "She was a tremendous leader with a big heart. I keep thinking I'll see her come trotting through the dense underbrush like she used to, but I have to accept that she's really gone," said a local deer, explaining that the notable doe had spent her whole life in the same stretch of woods, surviving two forest fires. "Even though I was just a yearling, I can still remember the time she prevented a major catastrophe by warning all of us about an approaching coyote with a series of loud grunts." "I don't know how anyone could run her down in their car and then just leave her lying there on the side of the road," continued the deer, pausing to compose himself. "We're never going to forget her." Though she was roundly celebrated for her strength and leadership in the deer community, sources confirmed that many of the area's younger deer also looked up to the doe for grooming tips, citing her healthy coat and the fact that she rarely had ticks. In addition, numerous local deer noted that the circumstances of her passing were especially tragic given that the doe had maintained her loving devotion to her mate throughout his battle with bluetongue virus, which he succumbed to just last fall. At press time, a small group of deer had gathered near a copse of conifer trees to pay their last respects to the deceased doe, with many bleating uncontrollably.
