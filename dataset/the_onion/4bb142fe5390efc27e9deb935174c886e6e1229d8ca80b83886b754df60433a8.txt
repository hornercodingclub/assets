LAS VEGAS--The World Boxing Organization, International Boxing Federation, and World Boxing Association held separate press conferences Monday resulting in the eventual announcement that Manny "Pride of the Philippines" Pacquiao, a seven-time world champion, would fight Manny "The Mexicutioner" Pacquiao, considered the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, in a title bout on New Year's Eve. "We are proud to have the world's top welterweight fighting the world's best lightweight for the light-middleweight title of the world," an amalgam of press releases from the three bodies read in part. "This New Year's, the eyes of the boxing world will be on Atlantic City, Memphis, and San Juan. Also Las Vegas, if Pacquiao gains the weight to move up to the light-heavyweight division so he can finally fight Pacquiao." Meanwhile, representatives of the World Boxing Council have continued to struggle with staging their own world-title bout, which was marred when Floyd Mayweather, Jr. suffered a shattered cheekbone during his weigh-in, having struck himself repeatedly in the face before handlers could separate him.
