PHOENIX--In preparation for the fast approaching 2013 MLB preseason, the league's pitchers and catchers reported to spring training for their annual delousing, sources confirmed Friday. "Every spring, we make sure to give these guys a lice shampoo treatment, a rigorous once-over with a steel comb to get at any nits, and destroy their infected uniforms and caps," Milwaukee Brewers head athletic trainer Dan Wright told reporters while applying a thick, full-body lather to reliever John Axford and battery-mate Jonathan Lucroy. "It's a long offseason, and sometimes our pitchers and catchers pick up a little something that you don't want them bringing into the clubhouse. This procedure ensures that they start spring training clean, happy, and healthy." According to league sources, the MLB has required all ball clubs to thoroughly delouse their pitchers and catchers since 2006, when Oakland A's backstop Jason Kendall was responsible for an outbreak of pubic lice that spread like wildfire throughout the American League.
