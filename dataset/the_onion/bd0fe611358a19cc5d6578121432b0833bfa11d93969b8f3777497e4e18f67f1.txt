LOS ANGELES--Following a recent spate of fan campaigns to revive canceled television series through the crowd-funding website Kickstarter, the cast of the short-lived NBC sitcom told reporters Monday they live in constant fear that fans of the show will raise enough money to turn it into a movie. "To all the viewers who supported our show on NBC and would love to see the next chapter of played out on the big screen, I can only say from the bottom of my heart: Please don't ever do this," lead actor Justin Kirk said in a direct plea to fans, noting that the nine-episode sitcom about a misanthropic veterinarian was terrible and that any campaign to revive it would make him and other cast members deeply upset. "I'll say it right here: Being a part of this show was a pretty bad career move and one that I'm trying to move past. Honestly, I would have to say that anyone who is a fan of the show has bad taste and I don't really have any respect for them. Sorry, but I don't." At press time, sources confirmed that Microsoft founder Bill Gates had donated $20 million to the new Kickstarter campaign " Movie Project" with the accompanying note, "Mark my words, this movie will be made."
