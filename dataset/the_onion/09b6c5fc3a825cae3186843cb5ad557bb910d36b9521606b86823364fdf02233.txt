HOUSTON--Looking around anxiously from her place in the NRG Stadium concourse, Lady Gaga reportedly panicked Sunday after hearing her name introduced to the crowd for the Super Bowl LI halftime show while she was still waiting in line for the bathroom. "Oh shit, that's me!" said the pop star, anxiously craning her neck to count the number of people ahead of her in line as the opening strains of her first song echoed from the stadium's PA system. "C'mon, hurry up! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!" At press time, Lady Gaga was reportedly seen haphazardly readjusting her transparent bodysuit while sprinting out of the bathroom.
