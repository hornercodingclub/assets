EUGENE, OR--The members of local rock band Desert Ashes expect their careers to really take off following a rave write-up in music blog soundandfury.wordpress.com, the musicians said Thursday. "I don't think you can ask for a more positive review than that; I mean, this is just the kind of positive exposure we've been craving," said Desert Ashes guitarist Shane Flaherty of the WordPress-hosted website's laudatory 200-word review of his group's debut EP , which describes the group as "a wiry post-punk ensemble" with "manic guitar lines awash in atmospheric reverb" and "tart lyrics that also betray a certain world-weary melancholy." "I think we'll look back on this as sort of like the demarcation point where we went from being a struggling new group to being something much, much bigger. It's an amazing feeling, and we have the soundandfury guys to thank for that." At press time, Flaherty was refreshing his internet browser to see if anyone had posted a comment.
