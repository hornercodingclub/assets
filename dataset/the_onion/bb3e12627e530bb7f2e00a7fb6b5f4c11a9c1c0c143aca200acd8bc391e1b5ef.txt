PARIS--In an effort to modernize the principles and empirical procedures of examining phenomena and advancing humanity's collective knowledge, the International Council for Science announced Thursday the addition of a "Seek Funding" step to the scientific method. "After making an observation and forming a hypothesis as usual, the new third step of the scientific method will now require researchers to embark upon an exhaustive search for corporate or government financing," said the group's president, Gordon McBean, adding that the new stage of the process, which will be implemented across every scientific discipline, also entails compiling and forwarding grant proposals to hundreds of highly competitive funding sources. "Next, scientists simply modify their study's goals to align with the vision of potential funders and wait for several months to hear back. At this point--should this step be successful, of course--they can move on to the experimental stage, and then to analysis." McBean confirmed that the council was also developing a new initial step for the scientific process, "Assess Profitability of Research," which would help determine if systematic investigation is even worth pursuing in the first place.
