NEW YORK--Following recent reports linking him to a Miami-based clinic supplying performance-enhancing drugs, Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez reportedly warned accusers Tuesday that if they testified against him in court, it would come down to their "worthless" word against his. "Your reputation versus my reputation, bud. Good fucking luck," the 37-year-old veteran was overheard whispering to a source cited in a article alleging that Rodriguez doped. "Face it: No one's even going to listen to you. Put yourself in the jury's shoes. Who are you gonna believe? A couple of punk doctors or me, Alex Rodriguez? Gotta say, I don't like your chances." Rodriguez then reportedly gave the man a menacing look and said that if all else failed, he had an entire city of loyal fans willing to do anything for him.
