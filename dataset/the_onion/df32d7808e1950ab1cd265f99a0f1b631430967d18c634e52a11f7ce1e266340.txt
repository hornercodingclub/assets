NEW YORK--Once the euphoria accompanying his remarkable eight Olympic gold medals subsides later this month, Michael Phelps will be mentioned by name only half a dozen more times throughout human history, experts confirmed Tuesday. "Oh, there will be some endorsements, and he'll be brought up a couple times during the London games, and naturally we can't rule out trivia questions," said Marita Sturken, a media and culture expert at New York University. "But in the end, Mike Phillips will be just another footnote in history." An informal survey of prominent newspapers, websites, and magazines found that mentions of the once-prominent swimmer's name are already becoming scarce, especially towards the conclusion of shorter articles.
