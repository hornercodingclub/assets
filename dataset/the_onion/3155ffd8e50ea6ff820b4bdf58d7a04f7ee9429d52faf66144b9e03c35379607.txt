Guillermo Del Toro's supernatural romance The Shape of Water has received 13 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, placing it ahead of war drama Dunkirk and dark comedy Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri. What do think? "Well, I wasn't a huge fan until this outcome apparently indicated I should be." Shannon Donahue * Slander Disperser "Shame on us for indulging Guillermo Del Toro in another one of his sick fantasy worlds." Carter Grant * Barrister "Well, I'm glad to see the Oscars finally reversing its egregious trend of repeatedly snubbing aquatic erotica films." Greyson Pfeiffer * Orchard Hand
