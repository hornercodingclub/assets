dear readers do not be alarmed but since i became a giant cock roach i ve found it easier to type write in lower case i have a hard time moving the shift key i used to dictate my column to nurse pin head but I can no longer speak because slime drools from my mandibles and garbles my words so i have under taken the type writing my self pardon the choppy vers libre but my hairy fore legs are more apt to miss than hit the keys there fore i must be succinct to day i scared my my grand daughter violet carstairs zweibel and her society friends by dropping from the ceiling onto her lap you never heard so much shrieking in your life before any one could catch me i skittered up the wall and into a small hole in the plaster i had chewed i love being a cock roach but that angered my grand daughter so much she demanded my will be rewritten since i was now a lowly insect what rights did i have she reasoned my turn coat sons and shyster solicitor beavers agreed so they are going to court to have my will nullified the rat bastards i suppose i should not be surprised last week beavers tried to poison me with a stickum compound intended to slay vermin standish yanked away the stuff before I could finish it the idiot beavers could not tell his own boss apart from a regular house hold pest any way the stuff did not affect me my cock roach physique has blessed me with strength i feel like i could with stand any thing fire plague even devastating global war the apocalypse it self and i savored my status as the world s only insect columnist until recently that is now i get the news that my writings are not unique standish says that a cock roach named archy had found considerable success writing a vers libre column for the new york sun some years back god damn it some body always beats you to the punch
