LAS VEGAS--After winking and giving a thumbs-up to several female attendees seated in the front row as he crossed the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino stage, Vice President Joe Biden presented the trophy for Best New Starlet alongside pornographic actress Shyla Stylez at Saturday's 2015 AVN Awards. "This is my favorite category every year--it always gets me hard as a rock," said the vice president before listing off the names of the nominees and offering an open invitation to each of the erotic film actresses to stop by his room at the Golden Nugget. "While Uncle Joe's personally squeezed one off to each of the talented and hot-to-trot nominees, we can only have one Best New Starlet. And the winner is." The vice president then feigned difficulty opening the envelope, claiming that whoever sealed it must have forgotten to wipe their hands.
