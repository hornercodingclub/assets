Barcelona's trade unions are contesting one media company's plan to open a Woody Allen museum at the site of Pablo Picasso's former art school, a structure built in 1775 but unused since 2009, a proposal that the unions say caters much more to tourists than residents of the city. What do think? "This is a terrible idea. The construction costs on the Existential Dread wing alone would be staggering." Rita Bailey * Freezer Scraper "Wouldn't it make more sense to open it in New York where it could be enjoyed by Woody Allen?" Chuck Thornhill * Systems Analyst "Hey, when a family comes to Barcelona, they want to see Sagrada Familia, Montjuic castle, and the giant chicken costume from 'Sleeper.'"
