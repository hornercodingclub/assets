MEDFIELD, MA--Insisting that his prevailing injury could be serious, family members of retired baseball pitcher Curt Schilling reportedly urged the former Red Sox starter Wednesday to finally visit a doctor about his wounded right ankle, which continues to bleed 10 years after Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS. "[Wife] Shonda and the kids keep telling me I need to get this thing checked out, but I don't really see what the big deal is," Schilling said of his perpetually hemorrhaging ankle, which sources confirmed has trickled an uninterrupted stream of blood without clotting since the legendary playoff game a full decade ago. "I do wake up every morning to find the bottom of my bedsheets stained with blood, but look, I can still walk on my right foot all right. It's just one of those old baseball injuries, you know? Nothing to worry about." Schilling went on to say that unless it's an absolute emergency, he has generally been reluctant to see any doctor ever since he lost his health insurance upon retiring from baseball in 2009.
