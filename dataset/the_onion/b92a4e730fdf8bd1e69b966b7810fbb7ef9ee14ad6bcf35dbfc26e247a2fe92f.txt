OMAHA, NE--Local man Luke Dotson, 34, told reporters this morning that, regardless of who wins today's presidential election, he plans to take off all his clothes and run screaming through town as soon as a winner is announced. "Obama, Romney, whoever--honestly, it really doesn't matter," Dotson said of the ritual he engages in once every four years, rain or shine, no matter what the electoral outcome. "Don't you see? This is about more than any one candidate. It's about celebrating the democratic process." At press time, local authorities were reportedly already dreading having to wrestle Dotson to the ground in a public park, as they did in 2004 and 2008.
