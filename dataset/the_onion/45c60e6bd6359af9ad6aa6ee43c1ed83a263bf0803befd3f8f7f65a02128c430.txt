DAYTON, OH--In a dramatic three-point play with 7.2 seconds left in their first-round game, the No. 9 seed Tennessee Men's Lady Vols fell 77-75 to Oklahoma State last Friday. "With their heart and aggressiveness, these young guys really represent what it means to be a Men's Lady Vol," said coach Bruce Pearl, adding that the team really gelled after a talk on teamwork from Tennessee head basketball coach Pat Summitt. "With so many talented athletes on the court, we all knew it was going to come down to the wire. Hopefully, next time Mr. Lady Luck will be on our side." Rounding out a disappointing weekend for Tennessee, its heavily favored Women's Lady Vols title defense ended much sooner than expected.
