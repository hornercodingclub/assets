John Hamson * Precast Molder "The prophecy says that whoever wields Lincoln's sword, Grant's revolver, and Reagan's Levi's will lead the Republican nation to a prosperous 1,000-year reign." Kimberly Wills * Junction Maker "Thanks for letting me know. I'll spread the word to all my secessionist scrap metal buddies." Chris Endeacott * Window Washer
