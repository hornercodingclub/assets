The highest honor of the 88th Academy Awards went to Spotlight, a film based on the true story of Boston reporters who uncover the Catholic Church's systemic child abuse. What do think? "I hope 'Bridge of Spies' wins next year!" Larry Dumphy * Tea Steeper "Great. Now a whole generation of kids will grow up with the quixotic dream of becoming Boston Globe reporters." Grace Pidwolt * Manners Consultant "Everyone who worked on those other movies must feel so dumb for wasting their time." Norm Selig * Obstacle Eliminator
