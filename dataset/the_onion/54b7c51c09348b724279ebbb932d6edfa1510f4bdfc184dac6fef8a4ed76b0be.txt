AUGUSTA, ME--Nervously refreshing his inbox every five to 10 seconds, local man Gabe Hines was rapidly losing hope that his confirmation email from an online retailer would ever arrive, sources confirmed Monday. "Jeez, where is it?" said Hines, mentally berating himself for having closed the tab that contained his order confirmation number as he futilely checked his spam folder for the fifth time. "It came through instantly last time. Come on, what's the holdup?" At press time, Hines' spirits were elevated and then immediately crushed when a new message that appeared in his inbox turned out to merely be an email from his mother.
