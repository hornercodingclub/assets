While on an Antarctic search for evidence of small mammal bones, researchers inadvertently discovered the oldest animal sperm on record, a 50-million-year-old worm sperm inside a fossilized cocoon, though the sperm was broken into fragments and will be unable to shed light on the anatomy of the worm species. What do think? "It's stories like these that inspire me to keep digging for small mammal bones." Paul Sherides * Altar Repairman "Imagine all the sperm they could have discovered with more funding." Penelope Dorsey * Poultry Purchaser "So they found the oldest sperm, but it was broken? Great, thanks for nothing." Liam Thomas * PR Coordinator
