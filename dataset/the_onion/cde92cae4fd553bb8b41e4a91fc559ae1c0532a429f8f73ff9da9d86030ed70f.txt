The Supreme Court voted Monday to allow public meetings at all levels of government to begin with an opening prayer, a decision many have criticized as violating the First Amendment clause forbidding the government from favoring certain religions or favoring believers over non-believers. What do think? "Okay, but only Christian prayer. No need to go overboard." Casey Helms * Phone Line Inspector "That's fine. I'm sure beginning public meetings with a reminder that all who do not accept the blood of Christ are consigned to eternal damnation will not have a chilling effect on anyone who doesn't share those beliefs." Jennifer Keeling * Private Investigator "Whatever it takes to pack in those crowds." Bill Waterstone * Cutlery Sharpener
