NEW YORK--The identity of Deep Fruit, the source that brought down a studio audience in the Waterblank scandal in 1973, was revealed to be actor and panelist Charles Nelson Reilly, in an article published in today. "More than any other American game-show event of the '70s, the mystery of Deep Fruit held the nation captive," said Lynn Rayburn, the daughter of deceased host Gene Rayburn. "Through his repartee with my father and fellow panelist Brett Somers, Charles was the one responsible for filling in the blanks and doing justice to one-liners which would have otherwise gotten away without double-entendres. Very few men can claim the title of hero like he did." The announcement came as a surprise to the game-show-conspiracy community, which had theorized for years that Deep Fruit was Paul Lynde.
