WOODBOURNE, NY--Reportedly left dumbfounded by the news that recent parolee Terry Raney had been reincarcerated on charges of assault and battery, officials at Woodbourne Correctional Facility struggled Tuesday to make sense of how the prisoner had not been rehabilitated by 15 years of constant threats, physical abuse, and periodic isolation. "It just doesn't seem possible that an inmate could live for a decade and a half in a completely dehumanizing environment in which violent felons were constantly on the verge of attacking or even killing him and not emerge an emotionally stable, productive member of society," said chief warden Albert Gunderson, who noted that, as hard as it was to believe, Raney's recidivism proved that his criminal impulses had not in fact been corrected by the sense of grave distrust he felt toward every other person in the facility, including both fellow inmates and prison authorities, every day since 1999. "We surrounded him with a combustible mix of rival gangs and made sure that he was consumed by a round-the-clock sense of terror that the slightest misstep on his part could result in a sharpened piece of scrap metal being shoved into his neck, and yet he leaves this facility with the same criminal thoughts and violent mindset as before? I'm truly at a loss for how this could have happened." Gunderson then noted his additional confusion at how the man's criminal record and the social stigma of his prison sentence had somehow failed to land him a steady job immediately upon his release.
