CHICAGO--Gathering as much information on the residence as she could during the fleeting window of opportunity, local woman Kerry Egan was offered a brief, beguiling glimpse of the inside of the next-door apartment Monday upon arriving home at the same time as her neighbor. "Whoa, so that's what her place looks like," said Egan, discreetly peeking in through the tantalizing 2-foot-wide gap in the doorway as she unlocked her own door. "It kind of resembles my apartment--same general L shape, I think--but I can't tell if it's a little smaller or if it just seems that way because they have more furniture than I do. Man, that is a huge TV. That rug's really nice, too. I wonder where she got it?" At press time, Egan's own open door momentarily offered her neighbor an enticing glance at the dog that keeps her up all fucking night.
