MENLO PARK, CA--Warning that users who call for the suspension of bigoted accounts might just be afraid of a real debate, Facebook representatives told reporters Tuesday that classifying hate speech can be difficult because some posts actually make very interesting points. "At Facebook, we are committed to combating violence and hate speech on our platform, but can you really call these posts hate speech when a lot of them are based on science and logic?" said Monika Bickert, head of global policy management at Facebook, claiming that unless you're a sheep who just swallows everything the mainstream media sells you, a number of these posts had a lot to consider, and even if you don't completely agree with the attacks on race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation, it should not be a crime to make people think. "If you're as open-minded as you claim, you will see that while some of these posts cross the line, many of them are really nuanced and make good points. Of course, everyone should feel safe on Facebook, but it's hard to determine what's threatening because the more you watch these videos, the more you realize that Islam might be incompatible with west. Maybe people are just scared of hearing the truth." Bickert added that if people were such big fans of policing speech, she had some eye-opening videos on globalism she could share on Facebook.
