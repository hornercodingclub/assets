ARLINGTON, TX--Despite the overwhelming media hype, countless interviews with players and coaches, and considerable speculation about the big game since the conference champions earned Super Bowl berths nearly two weeks ago, Super Bowl XLV still hasn't happened yet. "It feels like it should have happened last Sunday, but it didn't," Ohio-area football fan Jared Britton told reporters Friday, adding that instead of the Super Bowl, the Pro Bowl happened. "So I guess there's still two more days. Well, three if you count today. Doesn't it feel like it should have happened already?" As of press time, the Super Bowl still hasn't happened.
