PHILADELPHIA--Explaining that the persistent feelings of fatigue, dizziness, and nausea in Michael Vick's non-throwing hand indicate the appendage is concussed, Eagles team physicians announced the quarterback will miss the next four weeks of football. "Until tests show Mr. Vick's right hand is reacting normally to stimuli, we cannot allow him to play or practice," a statement from the team read in part. "As of today, it has not responded correctly to our questions and seems sluggish and unfocused." Vick criticized the decision, saying that although his hand has no memory of the hit in which it was injured, it only has a mild headache.
