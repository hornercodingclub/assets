CAMDEN, NJ--Touting the device's ability to open nasal passages and fill the air with warm, red mist, Campbell's officials unveiled Wednesday a new line of ultrasonic tomato soup humidifiers. "The winter months can be hard, but Campbell's new tomato soup humidifier can dispense more than four gallons of hearty, homestyle relief throughout the night, leaving you both full and refreshed in the morning," said company spokesperson Jenna Fredrikson, adding that the device came with a custom filter that removes impurities and helps relieve cough and congestion symptoms with a delicious fog that's low in saturated fat and cholesterol and available in a variety of flavors, including sweet basil, chunky organic, and creamy tomato bisque. "Just place it on your nightstand, adjust the tomato vapor output, and wait as your room fills with thick, delicious, soothing steam for up to 12 hours at a time. Plus, its dual mist function allows you to dispense hot or cold soup, in case you'd prefer the air to taste more like gazpacho." At press time, Campbell's announced plans to also release a new "low sodium" tomato soup vaporizer after several customers woke up bloated and swollen.
