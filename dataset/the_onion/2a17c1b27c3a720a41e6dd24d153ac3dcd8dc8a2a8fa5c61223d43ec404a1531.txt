APPLETON, WI--Saying that the unfamiliar brand was different from what he was used to, local preteen Nicholas Fischer told reporters Monday that eating a strange new breakfast cereal had really set the tone for the first weekend at his recently divorced father's apartment. "The Raisin Bran Crunch wasn't bad, but it's just not what I normally have," said Fischer, 12, adding that the presence of whole milk instead of 2 percent milk was another indication of how unusual the next 48 hours would be. "Dad has a different cable package now too, so all the channels were weird. And he had a bar of Irish Spring instead of the liquid stuff we have at home. I mean, it's okay. It's just that everything's a little bit off." At press time, Fischer was back at his father's apartment and looking for a dishwasher out of habit.
