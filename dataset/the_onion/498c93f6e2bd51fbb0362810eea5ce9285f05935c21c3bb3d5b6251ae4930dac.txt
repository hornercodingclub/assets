AUSTIN, TX--Admitting that her attempts to fantasize about the victorious Senate candidate "just haven't been the same," noticeably flustered Beto O'Rourke voter Carissa Halpern told reporters Wednesday she was having difficulty refocusing her sexual yearnings onto Ted Cruz. "I was really hoping Beto would be my senator, but Ted Cruz won, so I guess I have to find a way to make this work," said Halpern, adding that no matter how long she stared at photos of Cruz, she kept getting tripped up whenever she tried to imagine him in any of the steamy, intensely erotic scenarios his opponent had occupied in her desires over the past six months. "He doesn't work out, he isn't handsome, and he certainly doesn't have an appealing personality or sense of humor. But he did manage to beat Beto at the polls, so maybe that's kind of hot? I don't know. Maybe if I picture him as being kind of like a sexy vampire? Oh God, no--no, that's definitely not going to help. This is really going take a lot of work." At press time, Halpern said that while she was still struggling to get off to Cruz, refocusing her sexual desires into fantasies involving torture and pain play was certainly helping.
