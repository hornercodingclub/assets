MOST MAJOR AMERICAN CITIES--Coaches, managers, team owners, quarterbacks, pitchers, drivers, hockey and basketball centers, league MVPs, Chevy Trucks Players of the Game, and others took time over the last few days to inform sports fans that they were the greatest fans ever. "I'd like to take a moment and thank the fans for all their support," sports figures at every position except wide receiver and in every city except Chicago announced at some time between Saturday's post-game press conferences and Wednesday night interviews. "I [am employed in a sports-related capacity] for the greatest fans in the world." Barry Bonds, Brian Billick, and Phil Mickelson could not be reached for comment.
