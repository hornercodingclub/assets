PITTSBURGH--Renewing her intention to cut back a little and only log onto the social network a few times a week at most, area woman Kathy Ward reportedly celebrated her fourth anniversary Tuesday of weaning herself off Facebook. "I realized that I just waste so much time on Facebook every single day, so from now on I'm going to really start limiting myself," the 31-year-old told reporters, restating a declaration she first made in early 2011 and has reiterated roughly every two weeks since. "If I can hold myself to only checking it on the weekends for a while, then eventually I can get down to one session a week, and at that point it'll be easy to just quit altogether. I don't even know who half my friends are anyway." At press time, Ward was on Facebook.
