STILLWATER, OK--A shocking investigation published in this week's shed light on Oklahoma State University's alleged practice of plying its football players with sex, drugs, academic assistance, and cash payments in violation of NCAA rules, revealing that the college is an absolutely awesome place to play football. "We found by enabling recreational drug use, encouraging recruits to sign by offering free sex, and paying some players over $10,000 annually that OSU is a totally kickass place to play football," said writer Thayer Evans, adding that the "amazing" Division I football program from 2000 to 2011 routinely provided "lucky-as-hell" athletes with "incredibly cool" illegal perks. "After discovering the typical OSU football player gets access to an unending supply of sex, drugs, and free money, all while the school provides a tutor to do your homework for you, only one thought came to my mind: 'Ride 'em Cowboys!'" At press time, every single one of the nation's top 300 high school football recruits had committed to OSU.
