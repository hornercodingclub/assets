CINCINNATI--Trailing the first-place Cardinals by only 15 games with less than a week to go in the regular season, the Cincinnati Reds cut their magic number down to 17 with a win over St. Louis Tuesday. "I think we've got the momentum now to wrap up the NL Central and go on to win the pennant," manager Dusty Baker said at a press conference following the game. "And though it's certainly not our strategy, we could always pick up the wild card spot, just as long as the Rockies and Braves lose to each other seven times tomorrow." Baker added that the tight NL Central race is "great for baseball."
