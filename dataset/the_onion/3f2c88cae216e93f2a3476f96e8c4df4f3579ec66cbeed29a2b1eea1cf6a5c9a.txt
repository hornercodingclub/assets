PHILADELPHIA--The first-round NCAA tournament game between 2nd-seeded Duke and 15th-seeded Albany ended in sensational fashion Friday after a buzzer sounded at the very last possible moment. "And there's the buzzer! Wow, what a finish!" said CBS announcer Kevin Harlan, who noted that the decisive buzzer seemed to go off at the exact moment time expired. "Did it go off before the clock ran down? They're looking at the replay now, but it looked to me like that buzzer went off just in time. Yes, the referees are confirming it went off with zero seconds on the clock." With the result in the books, the all-time combined winning percentage of 2 and 15 seeds in the first round now stands at .500.
