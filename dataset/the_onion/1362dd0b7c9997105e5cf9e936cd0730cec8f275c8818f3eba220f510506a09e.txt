NEW YORK--That right there, that play in which the team's main offseason acquisition outshone everyone else on the playing field for that brief period of time, is exactly why this team brought that player to this organization for a large sum of money, sources reported Friday. "Sometimes you're a little weak in that area of play and you need to go out and bring in a high-energy guy like that who can help take you to the next level," said a former coach in the broadcast booth whose general manager did the exact same thing before the one championship season he experienced. "That's why he's here. To be the final piece of the puzzle this team has been seeking for so long." Later in the game, the veteran player made an indefensible and costly mistake, causing fans in attendance to boo, angrily ask why team management wasted so much money on him, and question whether or not he should just retire.
