PHILADELPHIA--Seizing the opportunity given them when a United Airlines 737 passed over Citizens Bank Park during the opening festivities of Monday's Winter Classic, NHL officials attempted to convince the 46,967 fans in attendance that flight 2734 to Fort Lauderdale was in fact the game's ceremonial flyover. "Ladies and gentlemen, please rise and remove your hats for the men and women of American flying," the announcer told fans, who squinted up at the passenger jet as it began banking south--the first of several dozen that flew the exact same path over the course of the game. "Truly a sight to be seen. Now, let's play some hockey!" The NHL has refused comment on the performance of the national anthem, which many in attendance claimed was lip-synced by a wildly gesturing woman in a Patti LaBelle mask.
