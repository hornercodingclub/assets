OAKLAND, CA--Calling on his team to use the forces of tension and compression to their advantage, Golden State Warriors head coach Mark Jackson reportedly implored his players Wednesday to play like a suspension bridge. "We need to go out there tonight and play like we're connecting Yerba Buena Island and Emeryville for 48 straight minutes," said Jackson, asking his players to show their opponent they are capable of bearing dead, live, and dynamic loads by shifting them from the woven wires through the towers and onto the anchors where they can dissipate into the earth. "I want to see you hustling like you've got two decks of traffic running along you, and I want you manning up on defense like you're more adept at maintaining structural integrity during earthquakes. Remember, as a team you're all eyebars holding up cables individually, so if just one of you quits for a play this entire thing is going to collapse." Following a disappointing first half, Jackson reportedly told his team they looked more like a tubular bridge.
