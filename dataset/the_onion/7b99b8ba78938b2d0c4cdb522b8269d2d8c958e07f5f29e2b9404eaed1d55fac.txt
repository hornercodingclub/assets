ATLANTA--Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, whose passing improved dramatically over the past two weeks as he completed 66 percent of his passes and threw for seven touchdowns, claims his newfound accuracy came from his decision to throw the ball right-handed. "I just sort of got in the habit of carrying the ball in my left hand, and I just used my right hand for stiff-arming people," said Vick, who completed a remarkable 20 of 28 passes to his pleasantly stunned receivers in the October 29 game against the Bengals. "Do you know, a lot of people mistakenly thought I was left-handed? I guess that's my fault." Vick added that his fumble against Cincinnati was due to his not knowing that it was, in fact, legal to carry the ball in both hands.
