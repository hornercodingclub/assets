Select movie theaters in China are testing a new model of film-watching called "bullet screens," in which the theater projects audience text messages, or "bullets," onto the screen during showings, with texts sometimes becoming so numerous that they obscure the entire movie playing. What do think? "Good. There's nothing more annoying than someone texting during a movie and not being able to see what they're writing." Jeff O'Shea * Systems Analyst "That's ridiculous. Nonstop, anonymous rolling text that distracts from what's going on is for television only." Barbara Norton * Mic Stand Adjuster "I know we've fallen behind China in a lot of things, but I really thought we were still in the lead as far as making movies intolerable."
