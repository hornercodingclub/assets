SAN DIEGO--Fired up after a fun night of having the St. Louis Cardinals over to play baseball, the San Diego Padres asked manager Bud Black if the visiting team could stay at their stadium for the night, sources confirmed Monday. "I know you usually don't let us have friends sleep over on a baseball night, but it doesn't make sense to make them go all the way back to their hotel when they could just stay here with us," Padres pitcher Mat Latos was overheard telling his manager while standing next to St. Louis Cardinals pitcher and "new best friend" Kyle Lohse. "Plus, their manager already said it was okay." Black reportedly allowed the sleepover, but he made his team promise not to stay up too late or get so loud that they wake the umpires.
