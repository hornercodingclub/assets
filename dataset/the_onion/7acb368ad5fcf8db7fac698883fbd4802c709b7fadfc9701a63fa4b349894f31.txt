SACRAMENTO, CA--Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins was frantic before the team's home game Monday, fearing that he might have locker room cancer. "Feel under my shoulder blade, tell me if you feel a lump," Cousins said to teammate Luther Head, adding that he'd heard locker room cancer spreads faster than any other type of cancer and that once you contract it "that's pretty much it." "I'm pretty sure my grandmother died of locker room cancer. Her high school field hockey team used a locker room like every day. So it runs in the family is what I'm saying." As of 2010, locker room cancer remained the leading cause of death among the nation's professional and amateur athletes, claiming 582 lives in the month of December alone.
