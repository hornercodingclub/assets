INDIANA--Indiana Pacers guard Eddie Gill was presented Wednesday with the NBA's "12th Man" award by NBA commissioner David Stern's assistant. "Whether he was unhealthy and cheering on his team from the bench, or he was healthy and cheering on his team from the bench, Eddie showed up every day," Stern's assistant said in a ceremony attended by him and Gill. "Very few people can say they are a part of a professional basketball team." When a teary-eyed Gill took the podium to accept his award, he was quick to point out that, when he did play this season, he once scored seven points against Dallas and tallied two assists against the Lakers.
