WASHINGTON--After months of deliberation, the U.S. Supreme Court opted today to leave the ultimate decision on whether homosexuals should be allowed to marry in the more than capable hands of states such as Texas, Alabama, and Georgia. "As to the issue of gay marriage itself, we will not interfere with the individual commonwealth's authority to fairly and competently dictate its own laws in these matters, seeing as states such as, for instance, Georgia have time and again proven themselves eminently adept at making the fairest and most reasoned of decisions," said Chief Justice John Roberts of the state where sodomy laws were fiercely enforced until federally overturned in 2003. "Though the court's ruling will delay the recognition of gay marriage on a state-by-state basis, the nation's homosexuals should rest easy knowing that their freedoms and right to the pursuit of happiness lie within the famously rational and egalitarian legislatures of states such as Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Florida, Montana, Utah, and West Virginia." Roberts added that "who better" to have final authority on signing equal rights legislation into law than the likes of Jan Brewer, Rick Perry, and Scott Walker.
