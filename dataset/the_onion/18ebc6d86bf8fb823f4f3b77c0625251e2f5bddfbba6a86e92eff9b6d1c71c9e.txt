ATLANTA--Zeroing in with laser focus on the far side of the apartment, area woman Jess Macindoe placed the wall behind her boyfriend's couch squarely in her crosshairs, sources confirmed Friday. Macindoe, whose pupils reportedly dilated at the unadorned white space as she prepared to act, sized up the wall's entire 8 by 12 feet and began automatically cycling through a tactical suite of paint colors, mirrors, framed photos, and floating wooden shelves. According to apartment sources, Macindoe then locked on and navigated toward her target, recalibrating the precise heights of possible modern art prints with each step. At press time, Macindoe had reportedly opened her phone and begun scanning WestElm.com with extreme precision.
