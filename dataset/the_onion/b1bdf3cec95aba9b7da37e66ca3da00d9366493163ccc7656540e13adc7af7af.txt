SEATTLE--In spite of her efforts to sit down with friend Alicia Wright and help her navigate recent romantic and professional problems, sources confirmed Wednesday that 27-year-old Jessica Dennett has absolutely no fucking idea whatsoever as to what she's talking about. "I know it seems tough right now, but trust me, this is just a little bump in the road; things will be better before you know it," said Dennett, whose earnest but completely inept attempts to provide comfort and support only served to reveal how unqualified she was to address her friend's complex situation. "Believe me, I've been here before myself and it sucks. But it's painful experiences like these that make us stronger in the end. And when you look back on this later, you'll see that it's not even as bad as you think it is now." At press time, Wright was telling Dennett that her completely meaningless advice had been very helpful.
