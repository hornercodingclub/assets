NEW YORK--Assuring reporters that the team will soon be "back on a level playing field," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced Tuesday that the currently undefeated Kansas City Chiefs will not be permitted to create their own schedule again next season. "Though we allowed them to make these decisions this time around, the Kansas City Chiefs will not be able to handpick which NFC and AFC divisions they're matched up against next year," said Goodell, adding that in order to maintain parity across both conferences, the Chiefs will not be authorized to once again dictate which games they play at home or the timing of their bye week. "We felt it wasn't in the best interests of the league to invite Kansas City's upper management back to the NFL front office next April to choose their opponents, the order in which they play those opponents, each week's kickoff time, and the location of every game. Letting the Chiefs select the absolute easiest schedule possible ultimately reflects poorly on the NFL as a whole, and was clearly an abuse of the privilege." Goodell also noted that the league may allow the Jacksonville Jaguars to choose their schedule next season, but admitted to reporters "it probably won't make a difference anyway."
