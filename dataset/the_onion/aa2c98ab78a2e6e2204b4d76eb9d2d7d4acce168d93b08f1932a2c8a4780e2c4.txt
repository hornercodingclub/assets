BEDFORD, VA--Admitting she had not had any real alone time in years, local mother Terri Pope told reporters Tuesday that she could have used a few more days to herself before being reunited with her missing daughter, Allison. "I can't express in words just how relieved I am that Allison's back, but if I'm being honest, a part of me really appreciated having a quieter house for a couple of days," Pope said, explaining that while she could finally rest easy knowing her daughter was safe, she wouldn't have complained about an extra night or two without having to make the 9-year-old dinner and drive her to and from dance class. "Don't get me wrong, this last week has been a living nightmare, but it also gave me a chance to sleep in, and I was able to get a haircut I'd been putting off for weeks. Another few days and I would have been all caught up on ." Pope went on to say that at the very least she could count on having a little more downtime in the near future, as it was clear that Allison's little brother, Jeremy, would never be returning home.
