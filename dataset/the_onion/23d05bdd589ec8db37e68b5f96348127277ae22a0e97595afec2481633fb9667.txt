GRANVILLE, OH--Convening at their hometown bar to grab a drink and catch up on things, a group of old high school friends reportedly met up on Thursday as per their yearly tradition of saying the names of their former classmates. "Hey, remember that guy Dave Getler?" asked 32-year-old Kim Blackburn to a group of nodding Granville High alumni, each of whom took their turn listing a series of mutual acquaintances from the specific four-year period in their lives. "How's Marcy Levesque doing? Anyone hear from her? Oh, who was Shane Cook and Trevor O'Malley's buddy who used to date Karen Hest? Tanner Smith? I remember he would always sit with Devon and Sean in algebra--okay, now 'Sean Houlihan' is a name I haven't heard in a million years." At press time, those friends who still lived near each other agreed that there was no reason to wait another year to get together and say the names of former classmates as a smaller group.
