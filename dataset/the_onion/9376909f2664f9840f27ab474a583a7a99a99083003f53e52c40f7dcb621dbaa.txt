NORFOLK, VA--Though she hasn't spoken with him since they were both employees of American Mutual Insurance back in 2008, local woman Rebecca Pittman, 30, said Thursday that her former coworker Jeff Wallach, 35, still frequently "likes" her photos on Facebook. "At least once or twice a week I can count on getting a notification that says he likes one of my pictures," Pittman told reporters, adding that she and Wallach were never at any point close friends, though they occasionally made small talk in their office's break room. "Even if someone tags me in a photo of a large group of people he's never met, there's still a pretty good chance he'll like it. And weirdest of all, sometimes he'll click 'like' when I accept a friend request from someone he couldn't possibly know. Why the hell would anyone do that?" Pittman went on to admit that on the rare occasions when Wallach fails to like one of her Facebook photos, she actually gets a little bit offended and wonders if maybe there's something wrong with it.
