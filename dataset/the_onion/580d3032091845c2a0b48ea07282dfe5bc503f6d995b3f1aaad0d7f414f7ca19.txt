Several of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's top campaign aides resigned Thursday, putting the future of his presidential bid in doubt. What do think? "Interesting. Maybe I'll vote for him now that he's under new management." Morgan Fraser * Rotary-Driller Feeder "He was being advised that whole time? Oh, boy." Jill Baldursson * Back Tufter "It's just awful. I heard these people, whom Newt adored and trusted with all his heart, walked out on him for Tim Pawlenty, a younger, sexier candidate. I can't think of anything that Newt Gingrich did in his life to deserve a punishment like this." Lawrence Gomel * Systems Analyst
