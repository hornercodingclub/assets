LAS VEGAS--Having walked away following nine heart-pounding rounds, sources confirmed Tuesday night that former Chicago Bulls guard Michael Jordan is considering a return to the craps table at the Bellagio casino. "Sometimes a guy like that needs to step away for a while and refresh, but craps has always been such a big part of him that it was hard to believe he was leaving for good," frequent Bellagio guest Anthony Miano said of Jordan, whose trip to the bar also reportedly included a brief but unremarkable stint playing blackjack. "He's up $5,000, so he's still in pretty good shape. I hope he comes back, because everybody at the table agrees the game just hasn't been the same without him." Miano then wistfully recalled watching Jordan bravely refuse to leave the casino's daylong poker tournament despite battling a 102-degree fever.
