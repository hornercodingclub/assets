HARRINGTON, DE--Proceeding slowly while limping down the hallway of Lake Forest High School on crutches, 16-year-old basketball player Jeremy Moore was reportedly walking around Friday like a fallen war hero. "I went up for a rebound and just felt a sharp pain," said the junior shooting guard of the mild ankle sprain sustained in an away game, gripping his crutches tightly and bravely soldiering on as though he were the last surviving member of his battalion in the Korean War. "It's been really tough coming back here like this, but I did what I had to do for my team. Those guys are like my family." At press time, Moore was reportedly overcome with emotion when the basketball team dedicated their season to him.
