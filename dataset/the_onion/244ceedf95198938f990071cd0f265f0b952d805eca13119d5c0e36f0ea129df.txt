BEIJING--Noting that he can no longer walk up a flight of stairs without wheezing or suffering a debilitating coughing fit, Beijing resident Wei Feng admitted to reporters Thursday that his decades of regular breathing have really started to catch up with him. "Growing up, nobody thought breathing was that big a deal, but nowadays everyone knows how bad it is for you," said Feng, adding that his daily habit of respiration over the past 46 years has caused irreparable damage to his airways and lungs. "I've tried to cut back a couple of times, but it never lasted too long. At this point, I figure there's no sense in quitting since the damage is already done, and it hasn't killed me yet." Feng expressed optimism that the visible and devastating physical toll that prolonged breathing had inflicted on him would at least deter his children from taking up the unhealthy practice.
