TALLAHASSEE, FL--Despite over 10 minutes passing since either player had successfully made a basket, sources at a local public basketball court confirmed Monday that the missed shots of two young men playing H.O.R.S.E. are growing increasingly bold and ambitious. Early reports indicated that even after missing multiple three-pointers from shorter distances, the players continued stepping further back on the court, and spent four consecutive turns launching half-court shots that all bounced off the backboard without even touching the rim. The two individuals have also reportedly called out "Swish!" prior to a number of their shots, including one instance when trying to hit a one-handed turnaround fadeaway from the baseline and another before a behind-the-back shot at the top of the key, both of which resulted in air balls. At press time, one of the players had confidently walked behind the basket for an utterly futile attempt at shooting the ball over the backboard.
