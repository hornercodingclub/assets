Department stores in London are testing out new high-tech mannequins capable of telling shoppers what merchandise they're wearing by sending pictures of the clothing and prices to nearby cell phones, allowing people to shop without talking to actual salespeople. What do think? "I could've used that mannequin the other day when I couldn't decide if I should buy that Angry Birds shirt." Joe Deason * Building Imploder "That's great! Ordinarily, you'd have to learn about what clothing a mannequin is wearing by looking at the sales rack right next to the mannequin." Lynn Palladino * Art Historian "I prefer the human interaction of disappointing a flesh-and-blood salesperson who was counting on a commission." Chris Feld * Laptop Screen Repairer
