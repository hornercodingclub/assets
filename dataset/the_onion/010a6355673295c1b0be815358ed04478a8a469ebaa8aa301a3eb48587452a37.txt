BELLEFONTE, PA--Jerry Sandusky's lawyers told reporters Tuesday that the former Penn State assistant football coach is desperately hoping the judge "has a heart" and will take it easy on him while delivering his sentence for 45 counts of child sexual abuse. "This is a first-time offender who has always been active in the community and has shown great behavior during this whole trial," said defense attorney Joe Amendola, adding that Sandusky hopes to be released after serving a couple years so he can get back to his wife, his children, and "all his young friends whom he misses very much." "We're talking about a man who founded an entire foundation for at-risk youths out of the goodness of his heart. This is a good man, and I don't think anybody would argue that he doesn't deserve a little mercy." Regardless of the outcome, the defense reportedly intends to file an appeal after sentencing on the grounds that it was far too difficult to prove Sandusky's innocence given the timing of the trial and their client admitting to being attracted to children on national television.
