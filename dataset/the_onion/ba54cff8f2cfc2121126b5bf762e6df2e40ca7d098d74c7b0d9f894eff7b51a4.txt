WASHINGTON--In a display of weakness unbecoming a head of state, President Barack Obama concluded remarks to his nation Tuesday by asking a pretend man who lives in the clouds to watch over and guide the United States. "Thank you, and may God bless America," said the clearly insecure president, who, by seeking the aid of an imaginary being who is neither his ancestor nor someone with whom he shares a tangible harmonious relationship, freely admitted that he has little faith in himself and his inept team of jester advisers. Even more incomprehensible, sources said, is that hundreds of millions of Americans openly worship the all-knowing invisible man--who apparently observes the world's events from atop his perch in outer space--without fear of mockery, shame, or violent government reprisal. According to sources, citizens of the U.S. depend on the fanciful grandfather of magic to take care of everything for them, from aiding their tiny overseas army, to curing their illnesses, to helping their sports teams achieve victory, to providing little Jimmy McDonalds with his silly toys. Mindless spirituality reportedly inhibits progress and remains a bulwark against government rule. Yu
