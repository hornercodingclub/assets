LONDON--After Prime Minister Theresa May initiated official proceedings for Great Britain's exit from the European Union, sources confirmed Thursday that Queen Elizabeth II has been frantically trying to preserve the nation's European alliances by arranging the marriages of her great-grandchildren. "With Britain departing the EU, our greatest chance at maintaining strong diplomatic and economic relations with other countries in the region is for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to marry the children of one of Europe's other ruling families," said the queen, who had reportedly just gotten off the phone with King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands to discuss a possible match between 3-year-old Prince George and one of his three daughters. "I was hoping to cement Britain's trade partnership with Luxembourg by betrothing Charlotte to Prince Sebastien, but the grand duke wouldn't agree to the arrangement, and unfortunately, the King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden refused my offer of a spring wedding at Westminster Abbey between Princess Leonore and Prince George. If I offer control of Gibraltar and an earldom to the groom, I'm sure I can arrange for young Charlotte to marry one of Angela Merkel's stepsons when she reaches marriageable age." At press time, the queen was relieved to have at least secured a strong alliance with one European ally after she herself agreed to wed 14-year-old Prince Felix of Denmark.
