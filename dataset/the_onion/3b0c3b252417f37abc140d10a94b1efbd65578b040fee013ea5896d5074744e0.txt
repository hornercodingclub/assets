NEW YORK--The American people announced plans Monday to put on the Olympics, turn the volume down to a barely audible level, and leave the broadcast on in the background as they attend to washing dishes, sorting recycling, paying bills, preparing and eating meals, napping, and other quotidian activities in various areas of the house. "I'll support our athletes just as long as their events don't interrupt the flow of my daily life," said Allentown, PA resident Joann Kirkland, who recently declined a plastic Olympic cup from her local McDonald's. "I do intend to stand in front of the television for a few minutes on my way to the computer when the diving competition comes on, clicking my tongue and saying 'too bad' when the U.S. competitor fails to win the gold." Many Americans also stated that, if their televisions had a picture-in-picture feature, the Olympics would be the perfect thing to put in the smaller window.
