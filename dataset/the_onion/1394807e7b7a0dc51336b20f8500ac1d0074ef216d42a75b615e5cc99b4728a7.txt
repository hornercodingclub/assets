Educational nonprofit Raspberry Pi has released a computer motherboard called the Zero that retails for just five dollars, selling out of the product in a single day and giving away an additional 10,000 free units with each copy of their print magazine's December issue. What do think? "Once I give up on trying to put it together, it's nice to know I've only wasted five bucks." Gordy Loughman * Pamphlet Editor "They should have a little more confidence in their product. I'm sure it's worth at least eight dollars." Erin Reid * Calendar Manager "We've come so far since the 1976 Cray-1 supercomputer came free with a magazine." Beau Hitchens * Promotional Wholesaler
