KANSAS CITY, MO--His mouth watering as he described the elusive blend of herbs, salts, and spices, Chiefs coach Andy Reid told reporters Wednesday that he was still determinedly pursuing a perfect seasoning. "A lot of things have to come together for a perfect seasoning," said Reid, adding that his lifelong dream of tasting perfection led to countless hours of obsessive preparation and many late nights in the team's kitchen facilities. "It needs to have a little grit, it needs to get hot at the right time, and it will only happen for a truly special meat. I've been close to the recipe for a perfect seasoning before--it's actually why I moved to Kansas City." Reid admitted that while the cook-offs were the most important goal, the Chiefs' winning steak was "always in the back of [his] mind."
