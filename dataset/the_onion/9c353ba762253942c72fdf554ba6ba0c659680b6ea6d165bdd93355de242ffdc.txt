WARMINSTER, PA--Claiming he simply didn't connect with any of the people running for office this year, voter Carson Smith voiced his desire Tuesday for some kind of pre-midterm election race where voters could choose from better candidates. "I would have loved a chance, say, four or five months before the midterms, to see a wide selection of office-seekers, look at their positions on the issues, and figure out who belongs on the ballot," said Smith, explaining that he would feel far more invested in the electoral process if he could better weigh his options from a larger pool rather than just one candidate per party. "I guess it should probably be organized by the Republican and Democratic parties. Like, we see a bunch of different people, but then pick our primary guy." Smith also wished for some manner of public forum in which candidates could discuss their ideals and goals in the presence of a moderator.
