After a full year in office, President Barack Obama delivered his first State of the Union address. What do think? "With all his talk about putting people back to work, I really wish the president had announced an initiative to prevent layoffs at local Pizza Huts." Cathy Morris * Unemployed "I'm not really sure how good the speech was. Unlike other presidents, Obama said that the state of our union was strong right at the beginning, so I felt relieved and turned the TV off." Chris Hook * Administrative Assistant "I listened closely, but I'm still not sure if my dream of opening a small insurance company is good or bad for America." Luke Sumner * Insurance Agent
