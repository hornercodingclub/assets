HOUSTON--President George H.W. Bush realized Tuesday it had been several years since he had seen any members of the Secret Service detail that was assigned to protect him for the rest of his life. "I remember Barbara and I were eating at a diner when [Secret Service agent] Carl [Palmer] came up to the table and told me he had to duck out for a second, but I should call if anything came up," said the visibly saddened 41st president, adding that he could recall a "bright" and "lively" time when he was shuttled from location to location and there were Secret Service agents around him constantly. "Well, I haven't seen Carl since. I guess you eventually just get to an age where no one sees you as a target anymore." Later that evening, President Bush died quietly in his sleep.
