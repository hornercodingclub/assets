GREEN BAY, WI--Seeking to quicken the game's pace by not cuddling up before every snap, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers confirmed that his team plans to run a no-cuddle offense on Sunday against the Detroit Lions. "It's true the cuddle gets everyone on the same page and makes them feel safe and warm, but it takes quite a long time," said Rodgers, explaining that cuddling is more useful in hostile away stadiums where players often become scared or upset. "You also have to remember that when we cuddle, the defense gets a cuddle of its own where they get to snuggle up, catch their breath, and give each other affectionate kisses on the neck. Going no-cuddle puts them on their heels instead." Rodgers then added that he would still make an effort to give his running backs and receivers plenty of reassuring touches throughout the game.
