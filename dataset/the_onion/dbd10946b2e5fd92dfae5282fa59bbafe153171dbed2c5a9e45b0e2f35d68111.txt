ATLANTA--Displaying the virtually unlimited raw potential of a once-in-a-generation franchise center, multiple league sources confirmed Saturday that former Portland Trail Blazers player Greg Oden has looked absolutely incredible in a video from 2007. "He's just such an amazing physical specimen--the guy could destroy every center in the league," analyst Steve Kerr said of the video that surfaced five years ago, showcasing Oden's tremendous natural talents as a center for Ohio State University. "He totally dominates in the paint and around the rim. Guys with 7-foot, 250-pound frames who have that level of quickness and agility don't come around too often. How do you stop that?" Kerr went on to say that while Oklahoma City Thunder small forward Kevin Durant demonstrates a pretty high ceiling in a recently unearthed clip from 2006, Oden appears to "ultimately be the guy you can build a team around for the next decade."
