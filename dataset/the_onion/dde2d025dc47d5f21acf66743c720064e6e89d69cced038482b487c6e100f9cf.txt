NEW YORK--After Jets quarterback Geno Smith finished last week's game against the Giants with a 45.7 passer rating, head coach Rex Ryan told reporters Thursday that the team is very encouraged by the rookie's mastery of their offensive system. "All camp we've watched to see if Geno understands what we're trying to do here, and by completing barely half of his passes and throwing three interceptions against the Giants, he proved to everyone that he does," said Ryan, adding that Smith demonstrated a firm grasp of key schematic elements such as staring down reads, throwing balls behind receivers, and rarely leading a drive of more than 20 yards. "When Geno carelessly scrambled out of the back of our end zone for a safety, I knew he was ready to lead the Jets in the regular season. He gets it." Ryan confirmed that Smith's greatest areas for improvement are boosting his relatively low sack and fumble totals.
