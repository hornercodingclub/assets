MINNEAPOLIS--Mere moments after Brett Favre threw his record-setting 421st touchdown pass, a slant to receiver Greg Jennings in the first quarter of a 23-16 victory against the Minnesota Vikings, the touchdown ball was placed in a locked box, archivists began taking measurements of Jennings, and an architectural firm began planning the dismantling of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, all in an effort to move the objects and people in question to the NFL Hall of Fame in Canton, OH. "This is one of the all-time greatest moments in NFL history, and we must preserve as much of it as possible for future generations of fans," said NFL vice president Joe Horrigan while supervising the careful packing of the Vikings secondary against which Favre threw the momentous pass. "I am honored to have been here to see it, especially since that means I'm destined for the Hall of Fame myself." The ball, Jennings, the Metrodome, Horrigan, most of the crowd, and Favre's wife, Deanna and daughter, Brittany will be installed next to Kitrick Taylor, who caught Favre's first NFL touchdown pass in 1992 and has been enshrined in Canton ever since.
