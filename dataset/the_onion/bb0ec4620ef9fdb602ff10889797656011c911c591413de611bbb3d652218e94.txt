WASHINGTON--Explaining the rationale behind a two-year government budget deal crafted by members of both parties hours ahead of a potential shutdown, congressional leaders told reporters Thursday that they had put aside their partisan differences for the good of the nation's military contractors. "It's time that we stop bickering with each other over minor political disputes and start standing up for the brave defense contractors who keep us safe," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), echoing the sentiments of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other congressional leaders as they championed the bipartisan spending increases that would provide billions of much-needed government subsidies to U.S. military companies. "We may not always see eye to eye, but both Democrats and Republicans recognize how important it is to put politics aside when we're talking about the men and women in our private military sector." Senate leaders also expressed their satisfaction that the two parties could set aside their partisan disagreements to ensure that the bill did absolutely nothing to push for immigration reform.
