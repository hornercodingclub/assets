FRANKLIN, WI--2005 NASCAR Truck Series points champion Ted Musgrave said Monday that driving a Dodge Ram pickup truck also plays an important role in his life off the racetrack. "A lot of guys, they finish the series and they don't want to even look at a truck until next February," Musgrave said. "Not me, though. Just because I make a pretty good living nine months a year driving a truck doesn't mean I lose my passion for driving trucks for stretches of 150 to 250 miles--sometimes much shorter--come the end of the season." Musgrave added that he puts the same amount of effort and intensity into a January trip to his in-laws' house in Milwaukee as he does the Paramount Health Insurance 200 at the Texas Motor Speedway each June.
