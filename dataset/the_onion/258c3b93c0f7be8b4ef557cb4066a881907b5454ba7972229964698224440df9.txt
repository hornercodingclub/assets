Samsung debuted its much-anticipated Galaxy Gear smartwatch yesterday, which allows the wearer to make calls or read texts and emails from their wrist and use any of 70 apps, though the device has to be synced with a nearby Galaxy Note tablet to operate.

Dirk Redd * Snake Catcher "Great, a new place for phantom vibrations on my body." David Rosenthal * Broadcaster
