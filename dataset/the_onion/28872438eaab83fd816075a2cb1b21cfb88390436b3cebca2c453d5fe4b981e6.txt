NEW ORLEANS--Explaining that casually dropping the little-known fact into conversations "never gets old," local man Derek Matheson told reporters Monday he always gets a bit of a rush from informing others that John Lennon physically abused his first wife, Cynthia Powell. "Seeing the looks of shock, disbelief, and sadness on people's faces after I mention that John Lennon couldn't control his rage and regularly hit women is just such a treat," said Matheson, who reportedly derives a measure of satisfaction from planting discomfort in the minds of his acquaintances, coworkers, and even strangers at social gatherings by bringing up the biographical detail about the widely beloved musician and peace activist. "I'm always listening for someone to make a comment about the Beatles, and when it happens, I'm ready to jump in and say that not only did John Lennon beat his wife, but he beat his son, too, and that he even admitted to it on multiple occasions. It's always a nice little thrill." Matheson added that if people were already aware of the songwriter's violent side, he also delights in stating that Matthew Broderick killed two women with his car.
