MILAN, ITALY--Hours after being sentenced to seven years in prison for having sex with an underage prostitute and abusing his power, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was transferred today to the Genoan Women's Correctional Facility, a steamy, sultry all-female penitentiary on the Italian Riviera. "We believe our prison will be the ideal environment for Mr. Berlusconi to serve his sentence and pay for the crimes he committed while in power," said the prison's warden, Isabella Santaro, 18, who added that Berlusconi would have to regularly contend with the prison's thousands of scantily clad prisoners and guards, sweltering hot temperatures, and daily cell-block group showers. "This is a maximum-security facility, and while he is here, Mr. Berlusconi will spend the vast majority of his day locked down in a cage-like cell with two of our most notorious prisoners, the Sicilian lesbian robbery duo Sophia and Alexxxandra." Santaro added that Berlusconi will be strongly and repeatedly punished by the prison's staff at the first sign of "naughtiness."
