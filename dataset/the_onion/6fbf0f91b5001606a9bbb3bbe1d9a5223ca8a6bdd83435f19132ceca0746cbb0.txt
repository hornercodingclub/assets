BLOOMINGTON, IN--Having found himself without others to interact with at a house party Wednesday, guest Ben Weaver reportedly attempted to enter a conversation by spending a few minutes just smiling and nodding at the edge of a circle of people. "Uh-huh," said Weaver after gently nudging himself into a small gap between two members of the group and patiently making eye contact with each person who spoke in hopes of being drawn into the discussion. "Yeah, yeah." After he went largely ignored, sources confirmed Weaver quietly backed away from the group and repeated the process with three other clusters of partygoers before going home.
