DES MOINES, IA--Saying he planned to hold off for another 20 or 30 years and then assess where things stand, local man Trevor Russell was reportedly waiting to see how a few more decades of racial violence played out before taking any action, sources confirmed Monday. "I think I'll just sit back and take a long look at how institutionalized attacks against disenfranchised minority populations fall into place over the next couple generations before I really get involved," said Russell, 34, adding that he would have a much fuller picture of how people of color were being systematically abused by then and thus be better prepared to take a stand. "Let's see how all the violations of human rights unfold by 2040 or 2050 before I publicly commit to resisting bigotry and hatred. I don't want to rush into anything without really having all the facts first." Russell added that a few decades wasn't a hard deadline and that he'd defer action further if he felt he still needed more information.
