MIDDLETOWN, KY--Noting that his new look had really turned heads among friends and family, local man Steven Jensen told reporters Wednesday that he had recently stopped dieting and had already started to see results. "It's only been a month since I made the switch, but you can tell how much my body's changed," said Jensen, adding that he found himself purchasing a new wardrobe last week after discovering most of his clothes no longer fit him. "I don't just look different, I feel different. I mean, who knows where I'll be if I keep this up all year long?" Jensen went on to say that dropping his diet at the same time his wife dropped hers has made it easier on both of them.
