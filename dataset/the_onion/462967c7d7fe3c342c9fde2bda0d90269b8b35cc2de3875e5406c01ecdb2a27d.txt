A Japanese marketing firm is giving non-smoking employees six extra vacation days each year to compensate them for not taking cigarette breaks. What do think? "It's only fair if they're forced to spend those extra vacation days in a dingy, designated corner of the office parking lot." Ken Chadwick * Census Walker "Small compensation for never knowing the joy of looking out on a neon Tokyo cityscape through a cinematically perfect haze of blue-gray cigarette smoke." Teresa Townsend * Patient Transporter "Japan's smoking habit is the reason the country's average life expectancy is mired at a miserable 116." Alan Kantor * Eel Breeder
