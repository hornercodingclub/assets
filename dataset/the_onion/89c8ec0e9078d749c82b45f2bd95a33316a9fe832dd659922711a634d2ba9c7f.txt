LIBERTY HILL, TX--Making the call five and a half days into her normal cycle, local woman Erica Lauzon, 26, reportedly decided Monday that her period was over. "Yep, that'll do it. I haven't really checked, but it feels like we're about done here," said Lauzon, who took the lone tampon out of her purse and put it back in the box, figuring she wouldn't need it. "It had its chance. I need to move on and resume business as usual." At press time, Lauzon realized she had made a massive mistake.
