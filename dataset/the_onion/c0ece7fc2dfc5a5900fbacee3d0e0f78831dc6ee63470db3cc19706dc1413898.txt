Overwhelmed by the huge number of Amazon Prime subscribers who are choosing the site's speedy shipping service, Amazon is offering $1 in credit toward video downloads to anyone who chooses "No-Rush" shipping, which delivers products in five to seven days instead of two. What do think? "How much are they offering if I don't order at all?" Greg Kanalley * Muffin Slicer "Getting paid a dollar for accepting poor service is just one of the perks of a $99-per-year Amazon Prime membership." Matthew Sumpter * Livestock Counter "No way.  I want my DVD of in two days, and I don't care how many millions it costs Amazon." Patricia Hinzman * Salon Assistant
