Facing a $445 fine, a South Carolina woman will go to trial to let a jury determine whether the fake oversized testicles hanging off the back of her truck are obscene. What do think? "This ruling will have broad implications for the entire automotive genital-accessory industry." Ted Scuffleton * Systems Analyst "I'm not sure using the 'contemporary community standards' test to determine indecency will help the state's case. At this point, the whole country pretty much associates fake-testicle car ornaments with South Carolina." Lacey Cadeau * Lacing-String Cutter "I really hope they make this into a major motion picture. We haven't given Kathy Bates something to sink her teeth into for a while." Jarred Gordon * Pulp Bleacher
