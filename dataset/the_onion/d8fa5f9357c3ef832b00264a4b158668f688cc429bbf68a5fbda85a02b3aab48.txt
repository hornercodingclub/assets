NEW YORK--Hall of Fame Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor responded to allegations that he raped a minor by asking reporters at a press conference Monday to clarify which particular 16-year-old prostitute they were referring to, suggesting they provide her name and at least one physical characteristic. "I'm just not sure if you mean Brandy, Sherry, Susie, Angel, Carla, or Karla with a 'K'," Taylor said. "Is she blonde? That could possibly be Jen, Jennifer, or Andrea. You can't be talking about Candy, Lexie, or Jen, because they'd be at least in their 20s by now, or Sarah, because she's only 14." Taylor admitted that determining the identity of the underage girl would be difficult because most of the 16-year-old prostitutes he knew were dead.
