An internal memo from from a Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign staffer urged her not to run in the Iowa caucus, stating that she would probably lose. What do think? "If Clinton isn't willing to spend tons of time pretending to give a shit about Iowa, it just shows she's not ready to be president." Sara Frawley * Systems Analyst "Smart move. She needs to spend that time more judiciously continuing to reach out to her entrenched support base." Neil Callahan * Leather Tanner "Why not just announce to all of America that you don't care about flipping pancakes?" Orin Marshall * Carpet Salesman
