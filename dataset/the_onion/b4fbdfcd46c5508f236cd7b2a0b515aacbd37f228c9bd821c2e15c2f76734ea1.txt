Fans of the show were up in arms when it was announced that President Obama's State of the Union address might preempt the show's season premiere. What do think? "Hopefully, the speech will be just as suspenseful and tantalizingly inconclusive." Chance Stefanovich * Bar Manager "I don't give a shit. I stopped watching after the second season and quit paying attention to the State of the Union address during Reagan's second term." Pauline Shallcross * Greeter "That's cool with me. I'll still invite everyone over, but instead of drinking each time Des says 'brotha' or the smoke monster appears, we'll drink each time Obama says 'responsibility' or they cut to Lieberman." Chuck Trice * Systems Analyst
