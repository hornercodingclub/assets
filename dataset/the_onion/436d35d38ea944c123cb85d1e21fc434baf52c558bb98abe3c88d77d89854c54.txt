YOUR LOCATION--Based on the posture and facial expressions of those around you, incoming reports indicate that this is apparently the point in the conversation where you should be smiling and letting out a friendly chuckle. Sources with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed that, given all available evidence, now would also be an appropriate time for you to make eye contact with the person speaking, grin slightly, and say either the word "yeah" or "mm-hmm." Furthermore, because visual accounts suggest that the other people in the room seem to be in agreement about what's being discussed, it would reportedly benefit you to nod your head once or twice so as not to stand out from the rest of the group and draw attention to yourself. As of press time, late-breaking developments in group members' demeanor had confirmed that it was safe to resume not paying any attention at all.
