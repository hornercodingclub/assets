CHATHAM, MO--Concluding their investigation into the cop who fatally shot an unarmed black man during a September 2017 traffic stop, the Chatham Police Department announced Tuesday that Officer William Feldman would be let off with a promotion. "After a thorough examination of all the evidence, we've concluded that the officer in question should immediately receive a $10,000 raise and his own office," said CPD chief Greg Morley, who added that the force had a zero-tolerance policy for permitting any officer involved in the shooting death of an unarmed African American to remain in a non-leadership role. "It's clear to us from the body camera footage and from his own testimony that Officer--excuse me, Sergeant--Feldman acted out of fear for his own life, and his ability to quickly and deliberately decide that the suspect was armed serves as a shining example of good police work to the patrol officers who will now be his subordinates. His promotion sends a message that actions have consequences, and that this kind of behavior will not go unrewarded." CPD officials added that they were impressed by how Sgt. Feldman handled himself during the investigation, and estimated that he was likely only three to five shootings of unarmed black men away from a promotion to lieutenant.
