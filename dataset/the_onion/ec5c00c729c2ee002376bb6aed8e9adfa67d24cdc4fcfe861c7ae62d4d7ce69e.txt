NEW YORK--Hall of Famer Yogi Berra expressed frustration and disappointment during a press conference Monday, asking why the Yankees organization had made no effort to mourn his death in 2006. "I've given a lot to this team and yet they haven't done a single thing to honor me or show their grief," said the visibly distressed 85-year-old, adding that the team could have at least worn a uniform patch featuring Berra's initials. "I died over three years ago and didn't even get a stinking moment of silence. Well, you know what they say about dying: They don't say it." Berra added that at the very minimum the Yankees should let him address the crowd to say goodbye one last time.
