WASHINGTON--Questioning the former vice president's preparedness for the nation's highest office, CNN reporter Jim Acosta pressed presidential candidate Joe Biden Friday on his lack of a plan to trigger widespread violence across the U.S. "Sir, we are weeks away from the election and yet you still haven't offered your own comprehensive policies to ensure that Americans continue to be killed and brutalized in the streets," said Acosta, urging the Democratic nominee to highlight the concrete steps he would take as president to provoke bloodshed on a massive scale. "What message does it send to voters when you criticize President Trump's actions without offering a contrasting vision for terrorizing vulnerable citizens to the point that fear of bodily harm becomes a fact of daily life?" Acosta went on to critique Biden for never publicly disavowing the hordes of immigrants illegally casting ballots for him.
