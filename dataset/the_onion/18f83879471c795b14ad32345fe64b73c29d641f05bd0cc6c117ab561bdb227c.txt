MINNEAPOLIS--Having just signed the former Buccaneers quarterback at the beginning of October, Vikings head coach Leslie Frazier told reporters Thursday that Josh Freeman has already stepped up as a prominent leader in the team's search for a franchise quarterback. "Josh has really impressed us with his hard work scouting quarterbacks who could be the face of the franchise for the foreseeable future," said Frazier, adding that the 25-year-old is always the first to arrive at the team's practice facility every morning to interview overlooked free agents and often watches game tape of college prospects into the late hours of the night. "We don't even have to tell him what to do--Josh just instinctively knows where to find all the stats on up-and-coming college quarterbacks around the country and takes it upon himself to identify guys who could potentially lead our offense. He already found a couple of very promising players whom we're definitely going to pursue in this year's draft." An anonymous team source later told reporters that Freeman is also doing "an excellent job" helping the Vikings find a suitable new head coach.
