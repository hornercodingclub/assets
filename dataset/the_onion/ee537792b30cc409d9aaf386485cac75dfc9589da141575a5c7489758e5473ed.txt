After years of lagging sales, retail chain Abercrombie & Fitch is reportedly trying to ditch its stores' "nightclub vibe" by installing brighter lights, minimizing loud music and the smell of cologne, and featuring fewer pictures of half-clothed models on the walls. What do think? "Big mistake. Today's teens still like things loud and smelly." Martin Hass * Marine Mammal Trainer "You know what? It wasn't easy for me to put down the cologne, loud music, and half-naked pictures to get the teens to come back, but I did, and they have." Dennis Hutmacher * Payroll Examiner "All I look for in a clothing store is good prices and a sword swallower." Merrill Jollenbeck * Press Writer
