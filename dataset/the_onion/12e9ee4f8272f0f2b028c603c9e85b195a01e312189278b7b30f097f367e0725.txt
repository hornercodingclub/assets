Monsignor William J. Lynn of the Philadelphia Archdiocese received a prison sentence of three to six years after becoming the first Roman Catholic Church official in the United States convicted of covering up the sexual abuse of children by priests. What do think? "It's hard to believe this one guy was solely responsible for every single cover-up associated with the church's abuse scandals, but you saw their press release." Chrissy Laurenitis * Optometric Assistant "In addition, the court stripped the Philadelphia Archdiocese of all baptisms performed during Lynn's tenure, meaning it is no longer the baptizingest parish in history." Matthew Bakalar * Makeup Artist "All's well that ends well." Brian Moss * Mortgage Loan Processor
