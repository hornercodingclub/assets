Scholastic has pulled their title , a picture book about Washington's slaves proudly preparing for his birthday party, due to many parents' complaints that it misinforms children by romanticizing the relationship house slaves historically had with their masters. What do think? "Well, most children's literature requires a suspension of disbelief." Retha Hopper * Commercial Clairvoyant "This is a huge disservice to kids who want to learn the history of George Washington's birthday cake." Gerald Funke * Systems Analyst "Looks like the value of my copy just skyrocketed." Nic Anderton * Bridge Suspender
