CHARLOTTE, NC--CBS color commentator Dan Dierdorf provided detailed analysis of a player's shoe falling off during the Jets-Panthers game Sunday, speaking on the subject for several minutes as he determined the factors that caused the cleat to become detached from the foot. "A shoe just popped off, right at the 25-yard line, and it's still on the ground, lying motionless," said Dierdorf, who methodically scrutinized several angles of the broadcast footage in slow motion, establishing "that guy's shoe fell off during the play." "Wow, unbelievable. If you look closely, it appears that a teammate stepped on his left heel and it comes loose. And the guy keeps going without a shoe." At press time, Dierdorf was sharing an anecdote about a shoe falling off during his playing days with the St. Louis Cardinals as the Panthers scored a touchdown.
