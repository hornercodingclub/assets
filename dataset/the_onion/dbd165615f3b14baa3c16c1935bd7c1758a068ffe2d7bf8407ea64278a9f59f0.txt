WASHINGTON--According to a poll released Monday by Teen Zogby!, both Barack Obama's approval and dreaminess ratings among slumber party-attending tweens have risen to 82 percent following last week's publication of the cover pictorial "Hangin' With Barack!" "Barack is sooooo hot!" said 12-year-old subscriber Beth Majors upon reading the issue, which included a "supercute" poster of Obama leaning against the Lincoln Memorial and an interview in which he revealed that his most inspirational hero is "you." "He so totally has my support. Obama in '08!" Obama is expected to remain a solid favorite with the giggling-and-talking-until-4 a.m. voting bloc, as hunky war hero John McCain, his closest contender, is widely considered by the slumber party demographic to be a gross dork.
