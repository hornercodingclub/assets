CHARLOTTE, NC--Stressing that there is "probably no need to get involved," Charlotte Bobcats head coach Steve Clifford expressed confidence Thursday that a fierce ongoing dispute over unpaid gambling debts between two of his players will just work itself out. "They seem pretty upset right now, but I'm sure that if I give them some time and space, they'll settle it amongst themselves before anything boils over," said Clifford, adding that seeing the players physically restrained by teammates while one furiously demands that the other "pay the fuck up right now" is almost certainly just normal banter between guys in the locker room. "Given that they were only talking about a few thousand dollars from a card game, I'm sure they'll resolve the whole thing pretty quickly--after all, these guys are professionals, so they know how to conduct themselves. It's probably best for me to totally steer clear of this one and just let them handle it. Nothing much to worry about." Clifford also confirmed that rumors circulating about both players keeping unregistered firearms in their lockers are "likely just a joke."
