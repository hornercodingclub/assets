ALTOONA, PA--Following a contested pass on the sideline, living room sources just confirmed that local father James Kulick is convinced the receiver on his team controlled the football and managed to get both feet inbounds for a fair catch. "Just look, you can see it right there on the replay--he gets possession and both feet touch the ground before he goes out," said Kulick, adding that the receiver's successful toe tap next to the sideline is "100 percent clear when they zoom in all the way." "He dragged his left foot to the right as he got the ball, and he maintains control all the way to the ground. That's a catch, no question. Clear as day. He caught it." At press time, Kulick was reportedly furious after the opposing team had challenged the call.
