SANFORD, FL--As the trial of former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman entered its second day this morning, defense attorney Don West reportedly opened his team's remarks with an extended comic impression of Trayvon Martin, the deceased teen whom his client is accused of murdering in a fatal shooting altercation last year. "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'd like you to imagine for a moment that it's a dark night in Sanford, and my client sees an imposing stranger in an oversized hooded sweatshirt coming towards him--it might go a little something like this," West said before turning his back to the jury, pulling on a hoodie, grabbing a bag of Skittles and spinning back around to face the court. "Yo, my name's Trayvon, and I'm here to say/Suckers mess with me, I will make them pay." West reportedly concluded his impression with a nearly 10-minute-long freestyle rap, which sources said received no visible reaction from the jury.
