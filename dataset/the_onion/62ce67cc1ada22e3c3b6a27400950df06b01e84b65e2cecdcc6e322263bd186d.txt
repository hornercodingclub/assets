BALTIMORE--Exploiting a legal technicality that allowed him to regain full ownership of the Cleveland Browns organization in death, former team owner Art Modell specified his wish to permanently dismantle the 66-year-old franchise in his last will and testament, family sources reported Tuesday. "It is my dying wish that the Cleveland Browns team and associated assets be liquidated and distributed amongst the benefactors listed herein," read part of the document, in which Modell also stripped the franchise of its right to the team's colors, which the Baltimore Ravens will adopt for their second alternate uniforms beginning next season. "Furthermore, I hereby set aside funds in the amount of $50 million for the creation of a nonprofit foundation dedicated to ensuring that no professional football team moves to or is ever established in the city of Cleveland, from now until the end of time." At press time, sources confirmed Modell had bequeathed the Browns' 1964 NFL championship to LeBron James and ordered the immediate demolition of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
