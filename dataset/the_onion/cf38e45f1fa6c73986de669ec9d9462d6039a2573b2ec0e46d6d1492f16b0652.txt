In the days leading up to the Nov. 6 General Election, the Onion political team will answer your common questions about voting. Check back daily for two more responses to voters' most pressing questions. Yes. That's called a tie, dipshit. Find a piece of paper, write down who you want to vote for, and place the piece of paper in a nearby tree.

It's good to get out of the house once every four years. You're a real mess, aren't you? Don't you understand? Your ballot was inside you the whole time. Nah. How do you make your bed? How do you tie your shoes? What are we, your babysitters? Should you change your mind after voting, you may file a formal grievance with your county clerk. If you voted for the winning presidential candidate and now support the loser, your grievance will likely result in the removal of the current president or, depending on the circumstance, will at the very least exempt you from all the laws of the country for the remainder of the sitting president's term. Third-party candidates are not included in debates because they won't fucking win the election. Happy now? It depends on who's asking. Who is this? There is a man who counts the votes. His name is Brian Durgess. We continue to use the electoral college because no one has been able to come up with a simpler or more straightforward way to choose the president of the United States. Think about it: Is there anything more logical or intuitive? Nope. Open your window. If you hear gunshots and the wails of starving babies, the other guy won. Or, if you are Native American, you can smell most state and federal election returns on the wind.
