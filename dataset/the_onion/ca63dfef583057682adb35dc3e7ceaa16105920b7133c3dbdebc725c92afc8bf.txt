Select McDonald's restaurants in South Florida are testing out a new promotion that guarantees drive-thru customers a 60-seconds-or-less wait period for food or else they'll get a free sandwich on a future visit, which has drawn criticism from worker advocates, though McDonald's says it believes it will "energize the crew" and "entertain guests." What do think? "I'm not sure it's possible for me to be more entertained at the McDonald's drive-thru, but hey, go for it!"

Richard Sztaba * Cord Untangler "A free sandwich is the least they can offer for keeping me from eating something for a whole 60 seconds." Susan Littenberg * Unemployed
