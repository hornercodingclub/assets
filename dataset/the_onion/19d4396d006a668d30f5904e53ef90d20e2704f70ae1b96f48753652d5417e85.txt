SHULLSBURG, WI--Illuminating a previously unknown chapter of the man's past, an incoming call with a 617 area code provided an exciting glimpse into the life of 29-year-old Derek Eanesworth, acquaintances reported Tuesday. "Ooh, he must have lived in Boston for a while, but when and where, exactly?" said the call's recipient, Anne McDermott, her mind reportedly racing with possibilities about Eanesworth's suddenly revealed connection to eastern Massachusetts. "Did he grow up there? Work there? Go to school there? Now, I'm curious what strange chain of events could have led him all the way here." When reached for comment, Eanesworth told reporters he had no idea where McDermott's own 225 area code came from, but figured it must be where she got that weird accent.
