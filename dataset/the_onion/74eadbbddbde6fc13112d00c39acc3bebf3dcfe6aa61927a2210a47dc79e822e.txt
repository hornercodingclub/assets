GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA--Saying the expansion would ensure the facility is adequately prepared for upcoming challenges, officials at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp announced Wednesday that they had broken ground on a new geriatric care wing. "Our senior care center will be located immediately adjacent to Camp Delta and will contain all of the essentials our detainee population will need in the years ahead, including easy-access ramps from the confinement block to the exercise yard as well as wall-mounted grab bars and no-slip mats in the shower area," said Brigadier General Marion Garcia, who added that the facility's 116 beds and each of its various enhanced interrogation rooms would be located on the ground floor so that inmates will not have to go up or down any stairs when moving about, thereby avoiding unnecessary strains on their joints and helping to prevent falls. "We also plan to mount defibrillators throughout the corridors and in every solitary confinement cell, and make sure that our on-site clinic is stocked with ample stores of hypertension medicines and BPH treatments. As our detainees' needs change, so will our facility." Garcia added that the new space would be able to make use of a number of supplies already in the detention camp's possession, including its stock of feeding tubes and Ensure.
