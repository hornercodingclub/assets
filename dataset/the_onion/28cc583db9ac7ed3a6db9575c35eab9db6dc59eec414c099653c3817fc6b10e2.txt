NEW YORK--Osama bin Laden, 54-year-old leader of the international terrorist group al-Qaeda and mastermind of the 9/11 attacks that took nearly 3,000 American lives in 2001, was killed early Monday morning in Pakistan while sitting on the toilet, the U.S. populace took great pleasure in imagining today. "Just thinking about the stupid look on that evil bastard's face when those Navy SEALs kicked in the bathroom door and started blasting away--it's so totally priceless," said Queens, NY resident Rachel Sumner, one of 311 million Americans who reveled in a fictional scenario in which bin Laden met his gruesome and humiliating end while sitting on the commode, humming to himself, and reading a newspaper. "And him frantically trying to pull up his boxer shorts seconds before some badass Special Forces guy blows his head off--ha, ha! What a fucking moron." Some Americans have disputed this fabricated version of bin Laden's death, explaining they prefer to imagine the terrorist leader being surprised by Navy SEALs while wearing bright red lipstick, trying on ladies' clothing, sashaying in front of a full-length mirror, and saying, "Who's the prettiest little girl? Osama's the prettiest little girl!"
