DANVILLE, KY--Looking to boost his energy before entering the second half of Thursday night's vice presidential debate, Republican nominee Paul Ryan took a quick breather around the 40-minute mark to chug a rhino horn and bull semen shake. "Aaaaaahhhh," Ryan said after throwing back his head and swigging the 20-ounce mixture of shaved black rhinoceros horn, kale, pine nuts, and bovine ejaculate, part of his strict personal diet-and-exercise regimen. "You know, a lot of people never really learn how to feed themselves properly, and that's a shame. A smoothie like this one helps maximize endurance, shred fat, and fuel your body through an intense workout. It's a no-brainer, really." At press time, Ryan was faulting Obama for the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi while performing three quick jumping-jacks, a one-handed push-up, five yoga poses, and numerous kick-boxing moves.
