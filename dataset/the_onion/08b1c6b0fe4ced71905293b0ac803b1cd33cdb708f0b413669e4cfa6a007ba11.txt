DAYTON, OH--Throwing the generally positive customer review section into a state of disarray, a contrarian Amazon user reportedly upended the critical consensus Monday by giving a set of three Sunland-brand $18.99 microfiber bath towels a one-star rating. "I don't know what product everyone else here is talking about, because the towels I received are awful," wrote Amazon customer and irate iconoclast TobyPotts74, shattering a string of 19 consecutive glowing reviews that unanimously agreed the towels were a good value compared to others in the same price range. "They absorb water OK, but just OK; no better than terry cloth. Also the listing says the color is beige, which is WRONG. These are much closer to tan. Very disappointing. Don't waste your money on these." Citing principle, the radical dissenter confirmed that, despite the $7.99 return shipping fee, he would be sending the towels back to Amazon.
