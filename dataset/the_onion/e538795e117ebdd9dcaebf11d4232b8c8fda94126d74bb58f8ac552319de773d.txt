--Shocked and disillusioned sources across the nation reported feeling a "loss of innocence" last week when, for the first time in the country's history, increased negative campaigning began to reveal a long-hidden ugly side of American politics. "Like all of us, I believed our elected representatives considered themselves honor-bound to present public policy matters to the American people in as clear and truthful a manner as possible," said Omaha resident and mother of four Melanie Jenkins, describing "the dark, secret underbelly" suddenly exposed for the first time this past week in the misrepresentations and outright lies of political ads and speeches. "But now it appears something sinister is afoot in our civic discourse. How long has this deliberate manipulation of voters been going on right under our noses?" At press time, Americans reportedly became even more distressed after realizing that money may actually play a large and detrimental role in our political process.
