NEW YORK--Late-breaking reports from several major broadcasting outlets confirmed moments ago that recently cut quarterback Tim Tebow is currently drawing a significant amount of interest from American media. "There has certainly been a lot of chatter on Tim Tebow, linking him to several high-profile news stories," an anonymous source told reporters, adding that Tebow was presently attracting attention from ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, and ESPN as well as print media, radio, and the internet. "Obviously the frenzy of moves made by the media clearly shows that Tebow is a very intriguing prospect who has so much potential to truly shine in headlines, articles, or even as the topic of a short broadcast segment." Despite the overwhelming enthusiasm from the media, NFL fans have reportedly expressed zero interest in Tim Tebow.
