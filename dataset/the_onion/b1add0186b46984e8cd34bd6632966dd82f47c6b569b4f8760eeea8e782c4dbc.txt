THE HEAVENS--As he entered the Pearly Gates and walked the gold-paved streets of God's Eternal Kingdom, the late Rev. Billy Graham was reportedly so overwhelmed Wednesday by the great majesty before him that he did not at first notice he had taken a turn leading him down the main thoroughfare of heaven's largest gay enclave. "Oh no, oh--Where am I, exactly?" said the celebrated evangelist, who witnessed numerous same-sex couples making out upon Heaven's lush green pastures and became disoriented when a crowd of shirtless, muscular homosexual men poured out of a nearby nightclub and streamed past him on every side. "This can't possibly be right. I am in Heaven, aren't I?" According to heavenly sources, Graham, who during his life referred to homosexuality as "a sinister form of perversion," shrugged, smiled, and continued walking straight into the neighborhood's largest bath house.
