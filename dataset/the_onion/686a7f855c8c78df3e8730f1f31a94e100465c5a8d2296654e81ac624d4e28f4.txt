FAIRFAX, VA--Growing increasingly exasperated at his inability to make himself heard, local man Alex Turner told reporters Wednesday that he was frustrated by the fact that he is unable to leave a hateful message for a local synagogue because the line is always tied up with other threats. "I make it a point to call every morning, but why bother when you can never get through?" said Turner, 38, adding that the line is so swamped by menacing calls that he often has to wait on hold half an hour to tell a synagogue staff member that Jews did not belong in his neighborhood, sometimes having to call back numerous times because he just receives a busy signal. "I've left a couple of messages on their voicemail, but I'm not sure if they even listen to those, and it's usually full anyway. I'm sorry, but they should know by now to expect this kind of high call volume." At press time, an angry Turner decided he would just hang up the phone and deliver his message to the synagogue in person.
