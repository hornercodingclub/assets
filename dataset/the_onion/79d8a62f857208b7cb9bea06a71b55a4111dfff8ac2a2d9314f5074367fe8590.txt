FORT LAUDERDALE, FL--PGA players and officials took advantage of Tiger Woods' decision to spend the weekend out of town by promptly organizing a tournament on the back nine of the Coral Ridge Country Club Saturday after securing an 8 a.m. tee time. "We thought we'd get a quick niner in," tourney organizer Reginald Morrow said, adding that the $650,000-purse tournament was the best-attended PGA event of the season. "The weather was beautiful. We really had to take advantage of this small window of opportunity so everybody else could play some truly competitive golf for a change." Although Morrow claimed the nine-hole tournament ran smoothly, he said it was disconcerting when Tiger Woods called his cell phone several times, although he naturally let it go straight to voicemail.
