Parents of children who attend two elementary schools in Connecticut are angry after officials canceled all Halloween activities out of concerns that they exclude kids who don't celebrate the holiday. What do think? "That's ridiculous. America is a country founded on traditional spooky values." Dan Riddle * Private Detective "At least kids whose parents canceled Halloween for everyone will finally feel welcome at school." Rich McNeely * Granite Countertop Photographer "My daughter is going to wear a box covered in tinfoil to school on Friday whether parents like it or not." Lynn Allen * Souvenir Appraiser
