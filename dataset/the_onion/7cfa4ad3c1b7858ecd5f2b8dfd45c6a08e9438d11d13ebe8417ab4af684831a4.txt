BRISTOL, CT--Expressing their deepest most heartfelt sympathy, the American public announced Thursday that they feel really fucking terrible for the poor woman who sits between Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith on the ESPN program . "What could she have possibly done to deserve something so fucking horrible?" said despondent ESPN viewer Mark Humphrey, adding that enduring the arguments of Bayless and Smith was nothing short of cruel and inhumane punishment. "That poor, poor woman. Why are they making her do this? I can't imagine being in that appalling position. Those two are just repulsive monsters." At press time, Bayless and Smith were screaming about whether Tim Tebow would fit into the Patriots offense along with Tom Brady while the woman was silently cutting herself.
