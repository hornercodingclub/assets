PHILADELPHIA--Newly acquired Eagles quarterback Michael Vick was "humiliated" Tuesday after an iron he had left unattended inside the team's locker room sparked a blaze that eventually burned Lincoln Financial Field to the ground. "I just wanted to press some shirts so I could look nice and make a good impression on the team, but now everybody is going to hate me," said Vick, choking back tears as he surveyed the still smoldering remains of the $518 million stadium. "I didn't mean to do it. I tried really hard to put out the fire, but when I smothered the flames they just got bigger and everything started burning. I'm super sorry. I promise it won't happen again." Vick, who said he did not notify police or the fire department because it would violate the conditions of his reinstatement, added that the stadium might be fine once it cools down.
