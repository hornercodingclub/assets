PHOENIX--Finally closing a sordid chapter in team history, representatives for the Arizona Diamondbacks announced Friday that the franchise had settled a civil lawsuit with the offspring of a mourning dove who died after being hit by a Randy Johnson fastball during a 2001 spring training game. "We know this was an unspeakably traumatic moment for this family of doves," said attorney Doug Muhlenberg in a statement on behalf of the Diamondbacks, who went on to lament how long the case had been stuck in litigation and referenced a contentious period which saw a large flock of bird protestors demonstrating outside the courtroom. "While no amount of money can bring back their father, we hope they can move on from this ordeal knowing that justice has been served." At press time, the Diamondbacks announced plans to prevent similar incidents by installing a mesh netting over the infield.
