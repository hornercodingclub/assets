NEW YORK--Claiming that it "somehow totally slipped [his] mind," NBC CEO Steve Burke suddenly remembered Monday that he had meant to cancel the weekly news magazine program eight weeks ago, sources confirmed. "Wait, that thing is still on the air?" Burke reportedly said upon realizing he hadn't yet removed the underperforming show from the network's lineup of programming. "What night is it on again? Oh, man. Sorry about that. You know, I had it marked down in my calendar to cancel it and I just totally spaced. My fault." Burke added that it was ultimately not a big deal that he forgot to cancel the show, as "it's not like anyone would have noticed either way."
