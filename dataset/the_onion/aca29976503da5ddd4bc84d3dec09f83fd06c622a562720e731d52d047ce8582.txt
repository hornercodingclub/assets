RUMFORD, ME--Tasked with writing the 's annual preview of the Mountain Valley High girls' volleyball season, local sports reporter Patrick Carver again reused, verbatim, the article that has run at the start of every season since 1995, sources at the paper confirmed Friday. "Mountain Valley has a talented team this year," read the feature that, as always, praised the team's "strong group of returning seniors" but also predicted the squad "will be looking for some younger players to step up." "[Cross-state rivals] Wells is going to be tough to beat--they always are--but if the Falcons can fill their roles and play solid defense, they have a great chance at the championship." For the 18th consecutive year, the preview listed a Megan Johnson as a "key player to watch."
