Oskar Groening, a 94-year-old man known as the Accountant of Auschwitz due to his role in making the concentration camp profitable, was sentenced to four years in prison this week for his role in the deaths of 300,000 Hungarian Jews, a crime for which Groening apologized in court in a manner many felt to be insincere. What do think? "It's a good thing he lived long enough not to get away with it." Clara Hendricks * Bus Attendant "Whenever someone apologizes for killing 300,000 people, there's always that sliver of doubt about their sincerity." Maxwell Royce * Digital Foreman "Whether or not the apology was genuine, I think it's safe to say he won't try anything like this again." Brennan Hughes * Pavement Smoother
