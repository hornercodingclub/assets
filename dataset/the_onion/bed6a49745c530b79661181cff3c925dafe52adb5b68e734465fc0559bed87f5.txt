DALLAS--Bringing spectators to their feet with a stunning display of showmanship, Dallas Mavericks power forward Dirk Nowitzki shattered the glass of a backboard Wednesday night with his powerful soprano singing voice. "It was mind blowing--I didn't think he could still get that high at his age," said Mavericks teammate Tim Hardaway Jr., who recounted his disbelief upon watching thousands of pieces of splintered glass cascade across the hardwood court after the 14-time NBA All Star hit the jaw-dropping crescendo of his refrain. "And to think he was able to nail that note with [Houston Rockets center] Nene right in his face. No way that guy ever lives it down. I don't think I've ever seen a player finish an aria with such force." Hardaway added that it was amazing to see the stunned Mavericks fans explode in applause for Nowitzki while showering the court with red roses.
