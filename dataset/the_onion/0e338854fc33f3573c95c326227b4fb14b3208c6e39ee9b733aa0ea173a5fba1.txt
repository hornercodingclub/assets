WASHINGTON--Revealing that newly discovered ads and online articles could have been part of a coordinated campaign, a startling new report released Friday found evidence that Democrats may have attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election. "Although it's unclear if the efforts had any impact, it seems plausible that a loosely connected series of social media posts and grassroots word-of-mouth campaigns about the 2016 election could have originated in the Democratic Party," said report author Michelle Lipkin, citing several clandestine pro-Clinton ad buys on Facebook and a small-scale, mostly ineffectual anti-Trump research endeavor that was indirectly traced back to several DNC donors. "It's shocking in the least to discover the DNC dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars to shape the American democratic process; however, we are confident this hidden attempt at influencing the election had little to no effect on the final vote totals." Lipkin also warned it was entirely possible that the Democrats might attempt to interfere in the 2020 election as well.
