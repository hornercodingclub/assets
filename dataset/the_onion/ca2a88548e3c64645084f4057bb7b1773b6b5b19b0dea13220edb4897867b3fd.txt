VATICAN CITY--Bringing the tragic story of his righteous sacrifice to life, recently canonized martyr Salomone Leclercq on Friday was added to the Vatican Museum's Animatronic Hall of Saints. "This newest addition allows visitors to experience the courage of the godly man who was murdered for refusing to swear an oath to the secular government following the French Revolution, as told through our astonishingly realistic robots," said the museum's curator Bishop Marcello Sandri, explaining that Leclercq, canonized by Pope Francis in October 2016, would be showcased alongside animatronic recreations of Thomas Becket being hacked to pieces and Joan of Arc writhing in pain as she is burned at the stake. "As with all the saints in the attraction, guests will be able to press a button and learn about Leclercq's life and the miracles credited to him, all while watching him being run through with a sword over and over." At press time, the exhibit was closed while the museum upgraded the lions devouring St. Ignatius of Antioch.
