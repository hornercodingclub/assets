BOSTON--Hoping to minimize his downtime on set between contractions, expectant father Dan Hartfield spent a few hours Friday filming B-roll of his wife's vagina while waiting for the baby to crown. "Perfect, this is looking fantastic. Honey, could you scoot down a smidge so I can get better light?" said Hartfield, slowly panning the camera for an establishing shot of the midwife he believed would "really help place the scene" before his first close-up on the birth canal. "And, if you can, try not to move around so much in the stirrups. I'm having a real tough time keeping your labia in focus." Hartfield added that getting too much raw material wasn't a problem, because the footage of his wife's vagina that went unused for the birth movie could easily be repurposed for other videos.
