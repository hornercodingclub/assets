During last night's Video Music Awards, MTV aired a public service announcement addressing issues surrounding the crisis in Ferguson, MO, featuring young people describing the stereotypes they face, which executives say they hope will start important conversations about racism. What do think? "It's always nice to hear what Viacom has to say about racism." David McComb * Garage Door Installer "Good on MTV for doing its part to reduce the negative stereotypes it promotes." Kelly Wilson * Pet Specialist "This is a worthwhile conversation to have during the commercial break." Justin Gerhardt * Taffy Maker
