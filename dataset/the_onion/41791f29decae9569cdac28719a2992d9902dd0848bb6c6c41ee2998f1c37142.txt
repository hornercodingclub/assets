DES MOINES, IA--Declaring that all voting-age citizens who took the measures would be spared, Hillary Clinton ominously instructed her supporters throughout Iowa to mark their front doors with her campaign logo before sundown, sources confirmed Sunday. "All those residing in Iowa take heed: Your home shall bear the mark of my campaign this eve, or may God help you," said the Democratic candidate after dispatching a phalanx of campaign staffers to all four corners of the state to spread the message of her directive. "Be within your dwellings with the doors closed and locked before nightfall, and do not cross the threshold before the sun rises again in the sky. The emblem of the red-and-blue H will protect my true voters." At press time, Clinton issued a statement ordering all Iowan supporters who remain on Monday morning to bring forth their progeny between 18 and 34 years of age to the polls.
