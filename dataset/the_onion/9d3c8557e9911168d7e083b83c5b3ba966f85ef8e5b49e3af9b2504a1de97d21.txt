PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA--Over a week after Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius' arrest for the of his girlfriend, the burglar hiding inside the sprinter's shower decided that now was probably his best chance to make his getaway from the residence. "Well, I guess the coast is finally clear," said the 35-year-old robber, who broke into Pistorius' home on Valentine's Day, hid behind the shower curtain as the double-amputee shot his girlfriend, and evaded apprehension during the extensive investigation of the crime scene by quietly standing inside the bathroom tub for seven straight days. "Looks like they're finally done poking around. I thought for sure Pistorius would think to look back here after his girlfriend died, or at least one of those detectives, but nope." While slinking away from the residence, the burglar admitted he was especially lucky that the one detective who saw him hiding in the shower was too drunk to do anything about it.
