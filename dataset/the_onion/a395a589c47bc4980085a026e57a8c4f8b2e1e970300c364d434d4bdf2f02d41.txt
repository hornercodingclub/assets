BOSTON--Sources are confirming that the moments leading up to Mitt Romney's concession speech last night--from the expression on his face the second he realized he was going to lose, to the brief sigh he probably let out before walking onstage--were all more than likely pretty hilarious. "I'm not trying to be mean or anything, but it's kind of funny to imagine a 65-year-old man watching television, desperately hoping for something to go his way, learning it's not going to happen, and then just sitting there face forward while the rest of the room goes silent around him," Ohio resident Bret Foss told reporters, adding that the thought of a campaign aide putting his hand on Romney's shoulder and solemnly telling the former governor that it was all over just makes him laugh for some reason. "Maybe it's because the stakes were so high, but something about Mitt Romney hurriedly cobbling together a concession speech with one of his writers and then standing backstage all by himself as he waits for his cue to go on really cracks me up." Foss added that while it may make him sick in the head, he chuckles every time he thinks about the intense private moment Romney and his wife probably shared before he officially called the president to concede.
