While Barack Obama officially took the presidential oath of office yesterday in a private ceremony, a public swearing in will occur on the Capitol steps today, followed by two inaugural balls and performances by the likes of Beyonce and James Taylor. What do think? "It's good they keep the real ceremony private. I don't think the general public could handle seeing the president drinking all that blood from George Washington's skull." Ruth Hitchcock * Acoustics Physicist "It's absolutely ridiculous that there's even one inaugural ball given that the Benghazi matter is still very much under investigation." Leslie Ferrara * Gusset Maker "Nothing says presidential like some 'Fire and Rain.'" Art Orloff * Bodyguard
