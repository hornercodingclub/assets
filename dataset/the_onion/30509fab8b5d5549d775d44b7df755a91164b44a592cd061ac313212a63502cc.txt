A Washington Post poll asked Native Americans whether the name of the Washington NFL team, the Redskins, bothered or offended them, with 7 in 10 responding that they did not find the term offensive. What do think? "The Washington Post clearly didn't poll people who get offended on Native Americans' behalf." Dale Strauss * Beer Ager "Interesting. Did they say which other slurs they were okay with?" Candy Lipkin * Chord Builder "This is an important first step in asking Native Americans what they think." Boris Yount * Kite Designer
