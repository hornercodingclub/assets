NEW BEDFORD, MA--Waiting until her daughter and son-in-law were occupied getting drinks in the kitchen following a family dinner at her home Sunday, local grandmother Ellen Sullivan, 72, is said to have palmed her 11-year-old grandson Jason Tucci $10 like she was fixing a heavyweight boxing match. "Here," Sullivan said in a whisper, looking side to side as she slyly reached out her hand and slipped Tucci the neatly folded, concealed bill as though she were a Mafia bagman in a dimly lit dressing room paying off a prizefighter to go down in the fourth round. "Now don't tell your parents--this is just between you and me. Good boy." Later that evening, Sullivan reportedly stopped her son-in-law from unloading the dishwasher as if she were an angry pimp chasing some two-bit hustler out of her territory.
