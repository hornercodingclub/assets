PITTSBURGH--Finding themselves six games over .500 and vying for first place in the National League Central Division, members of the Pittsburgh Pirates organization are beginning to take notice of the surprisingly competitive Pittsburgh Pirates. "With us in contention this late in the season, I think we've proven that we can't look past ourselves anymore,"Pirates outfielder Andrew McCutchen said Friday, adding that he's become increasingly aware of himself as a force in the middle of the Pirates lineup. "Now when I look on our schedule and see the Pittsburgh Pirates, I know that we'll really need to show up for that game." According to sources, the Pirates are not the only ones beginning to pay attention, as the team's first winning season in 18 years has become a welcome distraction to locals who would otherwise be worrying about their own existence in Pittsburgh.
