NEW YORK--Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o admitted Thursday that he was one of several people duped by an elaborate hoax involving the death of his nonexistent girlfriend in a revealing interview with a scarecrow dressed as Katie Couric. "It wasn't just me--a lot of people got tricked," said Te'o, who reportedly reached for the scarecrow's straw hand and gazed longingly into the eyes drawn on the burlap sack face. "You know, Katie, your beautiful face reminds me a lot of Lennay's. You make me so comfortable, I feel like I've known you forever. I love how you're always smiling." At press time, sources confirmed that a panicked Te'o was frantically attempting to resuscitate the unresponsive Katie Couric scarecrow.
