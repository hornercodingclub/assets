NASHVILLE, TN--The first 500 visitors to see the Nashville Predators play hockey in their custom-built reinforced glass enclosure at Bridgestone Arena Saturday will actually be allowed to feed the team, Predators officials announced today. "For a few dollars, children and adults will be given a handful of player feed they can drop over the glass--like this--and watch the Predators eat," said general manager David Poile, tossing food on the ice as hungry players glided by, slapping their sticks and drooling. "Don't try to feed them from your hand, though. They may not have many teeth, but the ones they do have are needle-sharp. Also, don't tap on the glass. They'll fight." Poile further cautioned fans not to give the players food purchased at concession stands, because that food is not good for them and can make them very sick.
