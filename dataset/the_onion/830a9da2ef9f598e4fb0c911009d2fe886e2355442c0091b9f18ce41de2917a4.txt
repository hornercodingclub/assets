LOS ANGELES--All 12 Major League Soccer teams pooled their money together last Friday in an effort to sign European superstar David Beckham to a five-year, $250 million deal--the richest and most all-inclusive contract in league history. "Mr. Beckham will be a wonderful addition to the Galaxy, the Dynamo, the Red Bulls, the Fire, the Crew, and many other teams," said MLS commissioner Don Garber, who is also in charge of arranging which teams get custody of Beckham during certain weeks, games, and halves throughout the season. "We're very confident that David will lead one of these teams to the championship." Beckham, who recently claimed that he's always wanted to play in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Washington, Columbus, and Kansas City, will spend the next several months training, meeting with representatives, and being formally introduced at press conferences.
