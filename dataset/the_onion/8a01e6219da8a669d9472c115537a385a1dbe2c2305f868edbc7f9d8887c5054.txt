LOS ANGELES-- Promising that the memories and new friendships made at this year's pay-per-view event would stay with them forever, the professional wrestlers of the WWE exchanged tearful goodbyes Sunday as SummerSlam 2014 drew to a close. "Oh my God, I'm gonna miss you so much, Randy," said former heavyweight champion John Cena to Randy "The Viper" Orton as the two hugged outside the Staples Center. "I wish it was next summer already. You'll email me, right? Maybe you can come visit over Christmas if you want." WWE sources confirmed that this was the best SummerSlam ever and that SummerSlam friends are friends for life.
