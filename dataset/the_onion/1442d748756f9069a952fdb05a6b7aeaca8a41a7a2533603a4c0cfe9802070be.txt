NEW YORK--In a farewell ceremony before the team's Tuesday night game against the Rays, the New York Yankees paid tribute to longtime shortstop Derek Jeter by officially retiring his number and then forcibly escorting him out of the stadium, sources confirmed. "Over 18 incredible seasons, Derek was one of the best players baseball has ever seen, and his amazing career speaks for itself," Yankees GM Brian Cashman said to the crowd as he walked Jeter--who repeatedly looked around in confusion--to center field while former teammates Jorge Posada, Paul O'Neill, and Bernie Williams unveiled the number 2 jersey in Monument Park. "While we're all sad that this is his last appearance at Yankee Stadium, none of us will ever forget his amazing contributions to this ball club. It'll be strange not seeing you out there anymore, Derek, but you'll always be remembered as an all-time Yankee great. So let's hear it one last time for our captain, Derek Jeter!" The ceremony reportedly concluded as security guards took Jeter's hand and waved it to the crowd, dragged him inside the stadium against his will, and then shoved him out into the parking lot.
