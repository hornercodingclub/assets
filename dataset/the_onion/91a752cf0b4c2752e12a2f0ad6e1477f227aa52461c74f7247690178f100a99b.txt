NAMPA, ID--In an effort to provide space for the family during their time of mourning, detective James Horton reportedly refused Monday to pry into the circumstances surrounding 28-year-old Allan Lieberman's murder out of respect for the deceased. "Due to the extremely sensitive nature of this violent incident, I have decided not to look any further into this murder out of courtesy for the departed," said Horton, explaining that the Liebermans already had enough on their plate right now without anyone asking if Allan had any known enemies or had been involved with suspicious persons. "This is a difficult time for everyone, and it would only upset his loved ones if we performed a toxicology report to determine what, if any, drugs were in Mr. Lieberman's system. I think it would be better for us all if we could instead take a moment of silence to remember the victim as he was before the sudden and unexplained break-in at his office." At press time, Horton declined to follow up on an anonymous tip, as it was not worth the chance of sullying the victim's memory.
