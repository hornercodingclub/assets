AUSTIN, TX--Anxiously wondering what kind of impression he was leaving on university admissions officials, wealthy father Gordon Fring was said to be waiting restlessly for responses this week after mailing donations to his son's top college choices. "I sent in contributions to eight different schools all over the country and haven't heard anything back yet," said Fring, who added that while he submitted large sums to each of the private universities, he knew that thousands of other high school seniors' well-off parents had done the exact same thing, so at the end of the day, it was just a crapshoot. "I really hope I get positive news from Duke. My son's wanted to go there forever, and I feel really good about the amount of cash I sent them, so hopefully I have a decent shot. Fingers crossed." At press time, sources reported that Fring had become excited after receiving an envelope from Vanderbilt, only to quickly grow dejected upon opening it and finding a simple form letter thanking him for his gift.
