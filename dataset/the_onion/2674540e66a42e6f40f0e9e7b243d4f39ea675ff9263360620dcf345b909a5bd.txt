LONDON--Following a morning interview with Bob Costas, American swimmer Michael Phelps is reported to have surreptitiously asked the NBC anchor how well he does in tonight's 200-meter individual medley final. "I know you guys know the results of these things before you air them, and I know you're not supposed to say anything, but how do I do? Do I get a medal?" Phelps was overheard asking Costas in hushed tones, adding that if Costas told him the results of the forthcoming event, he promised not to say a word. "At least tell me what my time is. Is it a world record? A personal record? How does Ryan [Lochte] do? Am I leading after the first lap?" According to sources, Costas declined to talk about the swimming results, but privately assured Phelps that he would "not want to miss a second" of the 2:30 p.m. men's handball preliminary match between Croatia and Hungary.
