FRANKLIN, WI--Though the Green Bay Packers solidly defeated the Chicago Bears by 10 points Sunday, Packers fan Randy LaBelle reached into the depths of his being after the victory to bitch about the team's inconsistency when converting third downs and missed red-zone opportunities. "It's nice that we were able to run the ball against the Bears' defense, but we get so conservative at the end of games and let teams hang in there," said LaBelle, who also noted that the Packers gave up more than 300 yards through the air on the way to their 27-17 victory. "And why is McCarthy giving the ball to Starks when Ryan Grant is clearing running way better. We should be beating every team by at least 17 points. Jesus Christ." LaBelle reportedly spent the offseason complaining about the Packers' dropped passes and poor choice of run plays during their Super Bowl victory.
