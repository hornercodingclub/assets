EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ--Newly acquired Jets quarterback Brett Favre, when asked how he was adapting to the intricate terminology and increased complexity of the Jets' playbook after a career running the West Coast offense, assured reporters that he did indeed like football. "I like football," Favre said in response to inquiries as to how he would handle the emphasis on downfield passing and the increased demand for adaptation through the multiple audibles found in Coach Mangini's offense. "I like it a lot." Favre went 5 for 6 in the recent scrimmage against Washington and seemed to enjoy himself immensely.
