WASHINGTON--Reportedly racking their brains in an attempt to figure out how they knew that name, a puzzled American populace admitted Monday that while they definitely remembered hearing the word Ferguson, they could not quite put their finger on where. "Ferguson, Ferguson--God, I know that word from somewhere. It's right on the tip of my tongue," said Virginia Beach resident Mark Brown, one of millions of citizens nationwide who reportedly paused during the day and furrowed their brows in bafflement, before venturing guesses that the familiar-sounding term might have been a thing from TV or someone they heard a friend talking about. "Yeah, that definitely rings a bell. Hmm. Boy, I'm drawing a big blank on this one. Oh, well." At press time, each citizen agreed that wherever they had heard the name Ferguson, it probably wasn't worth any more of their time trying to remember.
