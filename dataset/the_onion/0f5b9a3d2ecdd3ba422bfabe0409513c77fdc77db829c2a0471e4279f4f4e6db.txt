NEW YORK--In a commendable act of charity and goodwill, local improv troupe Calhoun reportedly showcased their talents completely free of charge Sunday night in the basement of a local performing arts space. "What do you mean you're a dog?" Calhoun's Nick Clewson said to his barking co-star Daryl Crane during a show the group could easily have charged a $20 admission to but, in a gesture of magnanimity, chose to offer to the public at no cost, as they do every week. "Well, luckily, I speak fluent dog. That means, 'Freeze! You're under arrest.'" Following the performance, group members extended their generosity further by voluntarily folding the audience's metal chairs and stacking them in a storage room.
