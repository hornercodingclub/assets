SAN JOSE, CA--Citing poor season-ticket sales, lackluster attendance, and the fact that they "just play better in front of a crowd," members of the San Jose Sharks hit the streets Thursday with fluorescent blue fliers promoting their upcoming game against the Los Angeles Kings. "Anyone here into sports at all? 'Cause if you are, I think you'd really like what we do," Sharks team captain and public-relations coordinator Patrick Marleau said to a group of politely attentive shoppers on Santana Row. "There's going to be live organ music, we have beer and nachos and stuff, it's a good atmosphere. You guys should definitely come by later if you aren't busy." Marleau was assisted by Joe Thornton, the Sharks' leading scorer and 2005 NHL MVP, who assisted in tearing off pieces of tape and made sure the 'GAME 2-NITE' posters were level.
