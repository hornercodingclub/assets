OSN shares its expert analysis on the teams that will come away with victory in this weekend's NFL week six games: - Eli Manning will throw three picks and Jay Cutler will find Brandon Marshall in the end zone twice in this 27-21 Bears win, but none of that will matter once Tom Coughlin finally notices that oddly colored mole underneath his left arm in the shower Friday morning. - Look for the Cincinnati defense to confuse Thad Lewis with relentless questions about who he is and how he ended up as the Bills quarterback. - This game will go to the team that wants it more that is not the Browns. - The Chiefs have the NFL's best red zone defense, but that won't play any factor against the Raiders. - Don't look now, but the Panthers are quietly putting together an unremarkable season. - A loss against the Jets will finally provide a much-needed fifth wake-up call for the Steelers. - Expect Josh Freeman to continue leading the team in passing touchdowns this season. - The Ravens have been without star quarterback 2012 Joe Flacco and will continue to struggle under 2008-2011 Joe Flacco. - The Rams will really come together as a team to get Matt Schaub's confidence back up. - Jacksonville will struggle with the thin mountain air, grass field, and challenging game of football. - Expect Seattle to establish their running-up-the-score game early on. - An offensive showdown that will likely come down to who has the ball 89th. - A win for the 49ers will go a long way toward distinguishing the teams in a division that's currently an impressionistic blur when we look at it. - The Redskins are coming off a bye week, so the team might need a quarter or so to get back out of sync. - San Diego will need to jump out to an early lead if they expect to lose another close game.
