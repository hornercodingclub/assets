United Airlines CEO Jeff Smisek has resigned amid a federal investigation into the airline's alleged reestablishment of an unprofitable flight from Newark, NJ to Columbia, SC solely to benefit the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who owns a vacation home in Columbia, which began when the flight was canceled shortly after the chairman stepped down from his post. What do think? "Just another example of how the airlines go above and beyond for their customers." Mike Killmer * Unemployed "Madison, Wisconsin to San Francisco is $354 on United right now." Grant Jeffers * Retired Welder "Yeah, but the chairman still had to pay a carry-on baggage fee, so it's not as cushy as it seems." Cassie Strickland * Nuclear Engineer
