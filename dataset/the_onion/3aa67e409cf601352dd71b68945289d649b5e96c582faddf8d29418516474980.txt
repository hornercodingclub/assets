MILWAUKEE--Barely mentioning the Milwaukee Bucks Monday night, the Bradley Center's public-address announcer continually showed blatant favoritism toward the Miami Heat, giving them an overblown introduction that included bombastically shouting each of the starters names, blasting music, and providing a choreographed light show. "He introduced us first even though we're the home team, and he kind of just mumbled the names of our starters," point guard Brandon Jennings said. "Then the lights went out, a laser light show started, and he told the crowd to 'please welcome their Miami Heat.' I wish the crowd wouldn't have cheered so loud, because that just encouraged him more." Though they were disappointed with their introduction, Bucks players were reportedly impressed with the confetti that fell from the ceiling after their 88-78 loss.
