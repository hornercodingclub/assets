ST. LOUIS--Following Monday's trade between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays involving several named individuals and a player to be named later, Double A Springfield Cardinals catcher Bryan Anderson revealed that he realizes the player to be named in the swap is him. "Come on, let's be honest--who else would it be?" Anderson said from in front of his newly empty locker, his fully packed equipment bag slung over his shoulder. "Everyone knows the Rays are looking for a young, cheap catching talent whose fate they can control for the next six years. In fact, I'd even bet my questionable status as a prospect was what got me onto the list of potential player matches, considering [the Devil Rays'] history of penny-pinching." Though Anderson was admittedly upset about the impending deal, he did concede it was better than being dealt for cash considerations.
