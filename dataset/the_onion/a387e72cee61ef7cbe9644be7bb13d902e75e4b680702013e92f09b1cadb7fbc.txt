GRAND RAPIDS, MI--Fed up with an increasing workload and problems with his coworkers at CLG Software, project coordinator William Garsten reportedly took a list of grievances Wednesday to supervisor Todd Watkins, a middle manager utterly powerless to do anything about them. "I want to thank you for bringing these serious concerns to my attention," said the man with no chance whatsoever of effecting change of any sort anywhere in the company. "These matters are very important, and I'm extremely grateful to you for speaking up about them." According to sources, the man who will never in a thousand years bring any of this to Steve's attention then pledged to bring all this to Steve's attention immediately.
