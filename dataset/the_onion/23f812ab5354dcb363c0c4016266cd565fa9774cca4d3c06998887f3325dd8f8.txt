INDIANAPOLIS--NBC play-by-play announcer Al Michaels interrupted the broadcast of the Steelers-Colts game Sunday to ask color commentator Cris Collinsworth if they could talk about something other than football for once. "Cris, can't we just change the subject for once and have a real discussion about something that matters?" said Michaels, adding that he was sick of dull topics such as dominant NFL teams or how the Steelers should use Rashard Mendenhall in short-yardage situations. "I want to talk like normal men. How's your wife? What's your favorite piece of literature? Let's discuss remodeling projects, childhood memories, or the best weekend trips." After a short deliberation, Michaels and Collinsworth finally agreed to drop the subject of football and instead talk about the Kansas City Chiefs.
