WASHINGTON--Following the Senate's rejection of a bipartisan amendment to expand background checks for gun buyers, the young victims of next week's school shooting emphatically thanked members of Congress today for failing to pass more comprehensive gun control legislation. "Great job, guys," said 14-year-old Jacob Miller, one of nine junior high school students who will be shot next week by a mentally ill gunman wielding a legally acquired assault rifle that was purchased at a gun show. "My classmates and I are really proud of you for cowering to the NRA and caring more about politics than my friends and I getting shot and killed. It totally makes sense. You're the best." The soon-to-be massacred teenager added that his parents, Caroline and Pete Miller, also wanted to extend their heartfelt congratulations to the Senate.
