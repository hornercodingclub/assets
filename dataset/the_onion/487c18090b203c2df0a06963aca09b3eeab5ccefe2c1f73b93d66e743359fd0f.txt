STERLING, CO--Saying the condiment was really putting the rest of the team on its back, area man Kevin Bentley confirmed Thursday that the chipotle mayo was doing all the heavy lifting in his sandwich. "Looks like this mayo is going to have to carry us across the finish line, because there's absolutely nothing else on this sandwich that has anything going for it," said Bentley, explaining that the spicy southwestern spread would, as usual, have to lead the charge since the roast turkey had zero to contribute, and the shredded lettuce was essentially dead weight. "The soggy tomato sure as hell isn't helping, and that single slice of swiss cheese might as well have not shown up today. The bread should be pitching in a more, but it's just sitting there like it knows the chipotle mayo is going to bail it out eventually--which it will, of course, just like always." At press time, realizing that even chipotle mayo couldn't prop up every sandwich on its own indefinitely, Bentley tried easing its burden by adding some crushed potato chips.
