SEATTLE--In just the latest of his bumbling misadventures, dimwitted actor Jim Nabors, 82, reportedly found out today that he goofed up again after inadvertently marrying another man in a Seattle ceremony. "Aw, now, I didn't mean to go and get myself hitched to a fella!" said the lovable but slow-witted Nabors, who in a series of humorous blunders managed to get mixed up in a legal gay marriage ceremony with local man Stan Cadwallader before a Washington state judge. "Heck, I mean, a fella and another fella? I don't figure that much because, see, if he's a man, and I'm a man...then...then....well, golly, I can't make heads nor tails of this mess!" At press time, a red-faced Nabors reported being even more confused after being kissed by Cadwallader.
