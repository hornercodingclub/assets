CHICAGO--According to reports from within the Bears organization, pride has somehow been displayed by the team this week following its 39-10 home victory over the struggling 1-5 Vikings. "I thought we looked great out there," said head coach Lovie Smith, who for some reason praised his team's success in containing broken-down Vikings quarterback Donovan McNabb, passing for a mere 267 yards against one of the league's worst defenses, and defeating the last-place team in the NFC North. "And how about Devin Hester's 98-yard touchdown return?" added Smith, expressing pride in a third-quarter play that had no effect on the outcome of the game. Sources within the Bears organization said the team is also inexplicably proud of its 3-3 record this season, its 29th-ranked defense, and Brian Urlacher.
