MEQUON, WI--Seeking to convey his endorsement of his acquaintance's selection at local bar Coney's Draft House this evening, area man Thomas Dodge told reporters that he was considering nodding approvingly at his friend's alcoholic beverage purchase. "Kyle made a good choice here--I should give him a quick nod and maybe even a thumbs-up," the 27-year-old said after noticing his friend selecting one of Dodge's favorite beverages from the establishment's vast selection of available options. "I don't want to do anything too crazy, but I need him to know that I also enjoy the drink he bought and that I think it's a good drink. He really nailed this one, and he deserves all the praise that's coming his way." At press time, Dodge had decided to pay tribute to his friend's beverage selection by buying the same drink, establishing eye contact with him, and then confidently gesturing toward his own purchase.
