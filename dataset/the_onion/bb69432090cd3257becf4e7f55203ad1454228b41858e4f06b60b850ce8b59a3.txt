NORMAN, OK--Following the Supreme Court's landmark 5-4 ruling this morning striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, local bigot Donald Pohlman, 45, reportedly breathed a sigh of relief upon learning that homosexuals were still considered less than human under the laws of his home state. "Boy, that's a load off--for a second there when I saw all those gays hugging and celebrating on the Supreme Court steps, I thought it could have been really bad," said the visibly reassured hate monger, who noted that it was "very comforting" to discover that every homosexual living around him remained a second-class citizen and would continue to be denied basic human rights by the Oklahoma constitution. "Yes, sir, that was a close one! Luckily, my beliefs are being upheld and gay marriage stands no chance of getting through our state legislature--not if people like me have any say in it, that is." Pohlman told reporters he was further delighted upon reading a related article detailing the Supreme Court's recent rolling back of the Voting Rights Act.
