NEW ORLEANS--In a stunning revelation, doctors announced at a press conference Thursday that mandatory Super Bowl blood testing proved that head coaches Jim and John Harbaugh do not share the same father. "The Paternity Index from our DNA profiling analysis shows conclusive evidence that Jack Harbaugh is John's father, but Jim is in fact the product of a relationship between his mother and another man," said Dr. Gabriel Hosea, adding that the identity of the man in question "will not be made public at this current juncture." "I have already informed the Harbaughs, and while this was obviously shocking news to members of their family, we simply ask that you respect their privacy during this difficult time." At press time, sources within the 49ers organization confirmed that Jim Harbaugh had just left New Orleans to seek out his real father.
