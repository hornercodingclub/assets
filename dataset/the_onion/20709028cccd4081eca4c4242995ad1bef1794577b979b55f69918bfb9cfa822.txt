Old Dominion University has suspended its Sigma Nu chapter after the fraternity hung banners from their house reading "Freshman Daughter Drop Off" with an arrow pointing toward the front door, as well as other sexually suggestive phrases, prompting widespread outrage on social media. What do think? "Still, it's important to remember that there is presumably a fraternity out there that does some amount of good." Martin Thompson * Cafeteria Chef "Nice try, Sigma Nu, but everyone knows Omega Tau is still the most predatory house on campus." Kipp Olivera * Gutter Sealer "I can't believe they suspended the whole chapter when it sounds like all these boys really need is a stern round of high-fives." Maxwell Clark * Cadaver Distributor
