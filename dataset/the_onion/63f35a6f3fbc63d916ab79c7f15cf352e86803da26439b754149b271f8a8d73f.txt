During a speech Thursday, George W. Bush condemned the rise of conspiracy theories and bigotry in American politics, remarks that were widely taken as a critique of Donald Trump. What do think? "To be fair, any condemnation of the worst parts of human nature is going to read as a veiled criticism of Trump." Alicia Ewert * Crab Sheller "As an architect of an illegal war waged over fabricated evidence, I'll grant that Bush is something of an expert on this subject." Bob Levegh * ATV Crash Tester "This is a nice preview of Donald Trump's 2029 speech about the need for decency in politics." Corey Warheit * Bird Conservator
