WARREN, OH--Following the conclusion of the Little League World Series Sunday, sources confirmed that local 82-year-old grandfather Harold Wright hasn't been taking the South Korean team's championship win particularly well. "It's a travesty, is what it is," Wright said in the wake of Seoul Little League's 8-4 victory over Chicago's Jackie Robinson West squad, reportedly staring in disgust at the group of exuberant Korean youth athletes celebrating on his television screen. "And in our own backyard, no less. What a shame." At press time, sources confirmed that three days after the championship, Wright continued to occasionally shake his head while muttering, "God damn them."
