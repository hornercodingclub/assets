JACKSONVILLE, FL--Complaining that the phone was ringing off the hook, local suicide hotline operator Richard Bloomquist told reporters Monday that he's sick and tired of fielding calls from depressed members of the Jacksonville Jaguars. "They just keep calling, one after the other, saying 'I can't make it another week,' or 'I don't think I can keep going out there,'" said Bloomquist, adding that the hotline has begun hiring extra help specifically for Sunday nights to field the countless calls from distraught players and coaches. "The rule is never to lie to anybody, but how else am I supposed to tell these guys that everything will be okay? I mean, anybody can see there isn't a glimmer of hope on that whole damn roster, but I can't tell them that. We'd lose every one of them before they even hit their bye week." At press time, paramedics had been called to the Jaguars practice facility after wide receiver Justin Blackmon reportedly found out he was under contract through 2015.
