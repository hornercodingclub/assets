NEW YORK--In response to accusations that his policies are hurting the game of football, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told CBS's Sunday that he would have no problem letting his own son ruin the sport. "If my son wanted to make a series of catastrophic rule changes that destroy everything people enjoy about football, there's no question: Yes, I would let him do that," said Goodell, who argued that the value of defiling an American tradition far outweighs the risk of public backlash. "I myself have been ruining football for almost seven years, and nothing in my life has been more rewarding. I certainly would want my son to have the same opportunity to mangle and dilute the game that I did." Goodell added that, unfortunately, his two children are both girls, which means neither can ever be NFL commissioner.
