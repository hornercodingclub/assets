CIA director and retired four-star Army general David Petraeus resigned after the FBI discovered his extramarital affair with Paula Broadwell, the West Point graduate, Army reservist, and Ph.D. candidate who co-wrote his biography. What do think? "Listen, you don't get to be a four-star general without smooching a few West Point grads." Serena Ritter * Lapidary "As a married man, I can't tell you how tempting it is to fall in love with your biographer." Glenn Bradfort * Systems Analyst "That book was okay. I liked the military stuff, but got bored all those times it talked about his delicate touch or how his wife takes him for granted and doesn't deserve his love." Vicente Rivera * Reed Maker
