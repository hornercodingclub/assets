A coroner in New Zealand has ruled that a 30-year-old woman's death by cardiac arrest in 2010 was caused by her daily consumption of at least 10 liters of Coke, a claim that The Coca-Cola Company has strongly denied. What do think? "You just know health freaks are going to be out there saying you shouldn't drink 10 liters of Coke a day now." Michael McBee * Pump Mechanic "I don't understand why Coca-Cola won't just admit that its product kills people." Joey Finley * Calculation Reviewer "If she had only drank 10 liters of Diet Coke a day instead." Maritza Rivera * Elevator Operator
