CORVALLIS, OR--Instantly repulsed by the startling image, local woman Monica Arquette immediately deleted a picture that, above all others ever taken of her, most closely resembled her actual self, sources reported Monday. "God, I hate this one," said Arquette, promptly wiping from her phone's memory the most authentic photo of her currently in existence, both in representing her physical form and in capturing her overall essence as a person. "I look so weird. Not a chance I'm showing this hideous thing to anyone." At press time, Arquette was thrilled with a picture that vaguely approximated her actual self if squinted at long enough.
