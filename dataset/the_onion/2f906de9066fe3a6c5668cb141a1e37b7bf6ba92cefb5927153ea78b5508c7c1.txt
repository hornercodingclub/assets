CHICAGO--Following the FDA's approval of the prescription obesity medication Pryvexa earlier this week, users of the recently released weight management pill have confirmed that it is absolutely delicious. "They're so good, I've been eating them like nonstop," said Roland Holmes, 46, one of the thousands of overweight users who reported being able to pop full bottles of the phentermine-based pill every day. "I try to cut myself off, but they're just too tasty. I like to mix them in with my milkshakes or with a handful of my diabetes medication." In the wake of the drug's immediate popularity, the FDA has reportedly been forced to announce an individual limit of six bottles of Pryvexa per day.
