While renovating the basement of a bank he plans to turn into a restaurant, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver reportedly found $1.7 million in valuables, which included jewelry, New Order and Joy Division master tapes, and a gun. What do think? "I hope he takes this opportunity to start an amazing Joy Division-themed restaurant." Samuel Paice * Lift-Slab Operator "Jamie Oliver, you say? And here I thought the Joy Division story couldn't get any more depressing." Danny Gillian * Forge Utility Worker "Two of Britain's greatest exports--Joy Division and Jamie Oliver--have just come together in a veritable explosion of the senses." Quinn Glover * Restaurant Critic
