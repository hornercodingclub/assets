CHICAGO--Telling reporters Monday that it was one of the most memorable two-on-two Tournament Mode games of his storied career, former announcer Dick Walters described calling Scottie Pippen's classic 1997 fire double dunk game. "I could tell Pippen was going to have a good night once he threw down that front flip dunk after winning the opening tip, but I had no idea he would go on to dominate every single possession for all 12 minutes of the game," said Walters, who recalled impulsively screaming "he jams it in!" at the top of his lungs after Pippen threw a no-look alley-oop pass across the entire court to his werewolf teammate, setting off the 400 fans in an already electric Midway Arena. "People always like to talk about his 47 unanswered points, but what I'll never forget is the moment he wildly swung his hands around his body to strip Reggie Miller midair before launching himself from behind the three-point line and throwing down a dunk that burst the ball into blue flames. After witnessing that, I felt the only thing left to say was, 'He's got skills.'" Walters then conceded that, as great as Pippen's performance was, nothing could ever reach the heights of the Jungle Court match between the Bulls and Knicks that elicited eight straight "boomshakalaka!"s in the final two minutes.
