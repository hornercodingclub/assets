YOUR LOCATION--Explaining that staffing was a little tight right now and he would really appreciate the extra help, your boss was wondering Friday if you might be able to work late this year. "It's obviously not required, but you'd be doing me a huge solid if you wouldn't mind staying after hours for 12 months or so," said your supervisor, explaining that the extra time was required to make sure a few big upcoming projects get off the ground in the next four quarters. "You know I wouldn't ask you to burn the midnight oil like this if it wasn't really necessary. But I'm confident that if we can just power through, we should get everything squared away by the end of 2018, 2019 at the latest. Unfortunately, it's just our busy time of the decade right now." Your boss added that, in appreciation of your efforts, you should feel free to come in a couple seconds late on Monday.
