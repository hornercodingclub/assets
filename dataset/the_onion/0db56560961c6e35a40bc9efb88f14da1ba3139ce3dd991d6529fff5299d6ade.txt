KANSAS CITY--Responding to news that Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o's girlfriend had been invented as part of an elaborate hoax, Chiefs quarterback Brady Quinn reportedly spent Friday trying to verify the existence of his own girlfriend, Veronica Smith, whom he met online. "I'm probably being paranoid, but I figure if this can happen to Manti, it can happen to anyone," said Quinn, who placed several calls to Smith's hometown of Sudbury, Ontario in search of someone who knew the 23-year-old. "I mean, I think Veronica is real. We've been together for over two years and I got a cyber hand job from her earlier this week. I don't know--I just want to be sure I'm not getting played." At press time, Quinn had reportedly relaxed after receiving a text message from Smith assuring him that she existed.
