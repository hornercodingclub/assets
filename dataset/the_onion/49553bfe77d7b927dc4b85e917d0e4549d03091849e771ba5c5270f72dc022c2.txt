CHICAGO--Rambling to no one in particular as he paced back and forth across his office, wild-eyed Sears CEO Eddie Lampert was reportedly convinced Thursday that he had found the flannel pajama pants that will turn everything around. "Finally! I've done it! These woven pajama pants are gonna put Sears Holdings Corporation back on top!" said Lampert, adding that newest line of sleepwear would fly off shelves so fast that "Bezos is gonna shit his pants." "It's for men, women, and children! And we'll offer one with hearts on it! A red-and-green checkered one, too, just in time for the goddamn holidays! Ha-ha-ha! It's game over, assholes, because soon I'll have shipped out 10 million of the comfiest goddamn PJs in the entire fucking retail universe! Yes! Yes, yes, yes!" At press time, Lampert had filed for bankruptcy after converting the company's entire inventory to pajama pants.
