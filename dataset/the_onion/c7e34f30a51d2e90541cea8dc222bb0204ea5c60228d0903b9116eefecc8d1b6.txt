BURBANK, CA--While giving creative notes on the screenplay in a Friday meeting, DC Comics president Geoff Johns reportedly said he was concerned that a recent draft of the script was not compelling enough to support a movie, three more movies, a 2028 reboot, and four additional movies. "Frankly, I just don't see this having the legs to carry a feature film, a follow-up trilogy, a video game franchise, and then another prequel trilogy," Johns said, adding that while the script's first act "definitely works," he worried the narrative would drag when stretched to a full 90-minute runtime, several more 90-minute runtimes, and a dozen more 50-minute runtimes as part of the Netflix tie-in series. "I'm just worried this starts running out of steam well before the end of the movie, the comic book adaptation, and the standalone spinoff movies telling the Huntress's backstory. If a narrative can't even sustain a single movie and a Lego set, let alone more than one syndicated animated series, maybe it needs some heavy revisions." At press time, DC executives had decided to ask for a total rewrite after concluding villain Killer Moth was not an interesting enough antagonist to hold people's interest for two hours and the length of several Six Flags roller coasters.
