WASHINGTON--Insisting that it had to be in the audio recordings made during her time in the administration, Omarosa Manigault-Newman was frantically searching Tuesday through tapes of everyone else in the White House using the N-word for one of President Trump uttering the racial slur. "C'mon, c'mon, I know Trump's in here somewhere," said Manigault-Newman as she fast-forwarded through a recording of Stephen Miller and Jeff Sessions casually using the racial slur during a conversation in the West Wing. "I've got hours of John Kelly dropping N-bombs and a several where Trump is in the room when Bannon yells it, but I haven't found any of the president yet. One tape seemed promising, but there's a lot of crosstalk where everybody in the room was saying the N-word over each other, so you can't make out Trump clearly. Ugh, this is going to take forever." At press time, Manigault-Newman was forced to keep looking after all that turned up so far were two dozen recordings of Trump saying "wetback" and "dune coon."
