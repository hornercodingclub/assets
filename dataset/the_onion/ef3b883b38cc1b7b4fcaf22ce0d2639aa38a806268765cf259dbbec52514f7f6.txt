NEW YORK--Cleaning house after a dispute over the direction the team has taken this offseason, New York Jets head coach and interim general manager Adam Gase announced plans Friday to play all 22 positions on the field next season after pushing out the entire roster. "Coach Gase felt that the franchise needed a fresh start, and he wanted to put together a team that was truly crafted in his image, which is why he will be taking over all quarterbacking, offensive line, and defensive back roles," said spokesperson Erica Martin, revealing that each of the 53 active Jets players had been cut so that Gase could assume their duties, along with all coordinators, the team president, and the stadium grounds crew. "Coach Gase has a bold vision for the Jets, and he intends to be at the center of every personnel decision, kickoff, screen pass, and blitz. Now that he's found the perfect roster to fit his system, we are excited to see how this strategy plays out, even if he may be stretching himself thin by acting as team doctor as well." At press time, the Jets spokesperson had resigned to make way for new Jets spokesperson Adam Gase.
