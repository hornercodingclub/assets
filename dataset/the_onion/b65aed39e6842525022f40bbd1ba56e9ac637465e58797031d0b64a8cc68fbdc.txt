LAWRENCEVILLE, NJ--After learning NBA center Jason Collins became the first active player from a major American team sport to come out as a homosexual, gay 15-year-old Kyle Morgan confirmed Monday that he still plans to buy a LeBron James Miami Heat jersey. "That's great for Collins and all that, but have you seen LeBron this season? The guy is amazing," said the gay teenager, noting that James will "go down as the greatest NBA player of all time when all is said and done." "He can shoot, he can pass, he can defend every position--he can do everything. And he's absolutely unstoppable when he's driving to the rim. As soon as I have enough money, I'm definitely getting a Heat away jersey with 'James' on the back." While Morgan confirmed that he proudly supports Collins' decision to come out, the gay teen told reporters that James is "far and away [his] biggest role model."
