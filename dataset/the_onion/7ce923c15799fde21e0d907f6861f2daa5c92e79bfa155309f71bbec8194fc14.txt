A lawsuit filed against ConAgra Foods alleges its Hebrew National brand of hot dogs are not produced in strict accordance with Orthodox Jewish law, and therefore not kosher, despite being marketed as such. What do think? "So, there's a right way to shove a bunch of ground cow bits into an intestine?" Gene Dahm * Rim-Roller Setter "I can't speak to the kosher qualities of Hebrew National hot dogs, but ConAgra's Reddi-wip still adds the great taste of real whipped cream to my favorite fruits and desserts thanks to its new and improved formula. That's the real cream advantage!" Renee Ambrose * Dam Tender "What do they want exactly? I've been making all the pigs we use wear tiny little yarmulkes." Carl Vebber * Hog Farmer
