BALTIMORE--Following an anemic late-game performance against the Eagles last weekend, Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco confidently told reporters Thursday that he has now conclusively silenced all of his supporters. "I heard plenty of fans and going off about how great I was after our win against the Bengals, but I don't hear anyone talking now," said Flacco, adding that his 2-for-7, 21-yard outing on the last drive of the game with his team down by one point should "shut up all those loudmouths once and for all." "Maybe now they'll think twice before saying I'm an elite quarterback who can lead my team to a Super Bowl. I'm sick and tired of hearing that nonsense, and now I can finally just put it all behind me." In response to Flacco's comments, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh also came out in strong support of the fifth-year quarterback's complete lack of ability.
