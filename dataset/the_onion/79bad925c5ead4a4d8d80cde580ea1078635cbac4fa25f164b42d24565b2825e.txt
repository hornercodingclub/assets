BOSTON--Warning that he was a dark and vengeful God, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick reportedly pulled aside Tim Tebow at the team's facilities Thursday and informed the backup quarterback that he was his only Lord and savior now. "This is your church now, and you shall worship me," said Belichick, who sources confirmed clutched Tebow's throat and slammed the former Heisman Trophy winner against a concrete wall. "If you want to see a wrathful God, then question me on playing time. I will crush you into dust. And if I ever see you on your knees, you better be praying to me or you will be destroyed by my blistering fury." At press time, Tebow told reporters that he was renouncing Jesus Christ.
