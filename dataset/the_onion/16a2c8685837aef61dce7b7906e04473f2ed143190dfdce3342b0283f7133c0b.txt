MINNEAPOLIS--Following his release from the Minnesota Vikings earlier this week, punter Chris Kluwe reportedly responded Tuesday by composing a fiery editorial in which he laid out the numerous challenges facing cut NFL punters. "Speaking as a punter who has recently been released by the Vikings, I can tell you that discrimination against our kind is alive and well in this fickle league, and we need to put a stop to it right fucking now," an article written by Kluwe read in part, noting that such rejected special teams personnel routinely face discrimination from football organizations that won't allow them into the locker room, don't invite them to practices, and refuse to sign them to contract extensions. "Why should a cut punter be treated any differently than those players who are actually employed by a football team? Just because these athletes have been told that their services are no longer needed doesn't make them any less valuable to the squad than a starting QB. They--and I--deserve a shot at greatness." At press time, members of the Vikings roster confirmed that they felt terrible about never meeting Chris Kluwe before he was cut.
