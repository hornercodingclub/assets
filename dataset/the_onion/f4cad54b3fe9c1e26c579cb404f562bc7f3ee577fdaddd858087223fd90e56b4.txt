RALEIGH, NC--Marvelling at how often he finds himself consumed by doubt and anxiety throughout the course of his day, local 32-year-old Ross Erickson told reporters Tuesday that his array of personal insecurities was versatile enough to be projected onto any type of situation. "Sure, my fears that I'm a fraud who won't amount to anything and that I'm inherently unlikeable crop up in the usual places--like in my relationship or when I'm dealing with my parents--but what's really remarkable is that they're also adaptable enough to find their way into the most everyday situations, like interacting with strangers or even just thinking of speaking up in a work meeting," said Erickson, noting that his exceptionally flexible worries could assume control and cause him to completely freeze up in scenarios as diverse as attending a friend's barbecue, sharing an elevator with a coworker, or simply being in the presence of an attractive woman. "It doesn't matter whether I'm thinking about something specific like a work deadline, or something more general like the future; all my personal fears always manage to seamlessly work their way into my thoughts. There's really no limit as to when or where they can make me feel self-conscious and force me to analyze and obsess over every little detail involved." At press time, Erickson was mentally berating himself, convinced he had given a terrible, embarrassing interview to reporters.
