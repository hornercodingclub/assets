LOS ANGELES--Longtime fans of expressed uncertainty Thursday following reports that the classic tale of ambition and fraternity will be adapted to the silver screen, with fans conveying their doubts that any film adaptation could possibly do justice to the narrative intricacies and rich characterization of John Updike's acclaimed 1986 novel. "Given the sheer density of the original book, I honestly don't see how a two-hour movie could even come close to capturing the complex plotting and immense social impact of Updike's cutting show-business satire," said enthusiast Walter Landon, echoing the concerns of millions of bibliophiles worldwide who have, over the years, intently read and reread the 1,200-page PEN/Faulkner Award-winning narrative documenting the shifting fortunes of such timeless literary figures as Vincent Chase, Ari Gold, and Salvatore Assante, known colloquially throughout the novel as "Turtle." "How will the filmmakers possibly render the pivotal chapter wherein Vince buys E a Maserati? Or the torment experienced by Ari when he is asked to betray his own client? Or the brotherhood evinced in Drama's collaboration with Andrew Dice Clay in the absorbing text-within-a-text ? I'm sorry, but these are moments that can only really live and breathe on the printed page." At press time, the nation's buffs had reportedly eased their concerns upon learning the film's producers had recruited a cast and crew befitting the monumental work, including revered thespians Adrian Grenier and Kevin Dillon.
