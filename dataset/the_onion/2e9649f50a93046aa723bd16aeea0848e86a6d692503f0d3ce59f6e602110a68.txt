CLEVELAND--Having made his way up the series of ramps to Progressive Field's upper deck, 32-year-old Cleveland Indians fan Bradley Hunt's excitement for the upcoming game against the Texas Rangers quickly shifted to frustration after finding another person sitting in his section, sources confirmed Friday. "Oh, come on, what is this guy doing here?" Hunt said in reference to the lone man in the sea of empty rows overlooking right field, noting that there were plenty of other unoccupied upper deck sections nearby where one could sit and watch the game alone from an equally good vantage point. "It's so annoying to climb all the way up here expecting to grab my section, only to find some random guy took it. I mean, I paid $14 for this. It's ridiculous." At press time, having failed to sort the situation out diplomatically, an irate Hunt was searching for the stadium's lone usher to escort the man out.
