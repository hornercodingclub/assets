BROOKLYN, NY--Giants fan and Brooklyn resident Charles Somers, 34, can still remember exactly where he was on the early February day when the New York Giants won the NFL championship by defeating the New England Patriots in the 2012 Super Bowl. "I can still recall just what I was doing when the clock wound down--I was in my place, hardly able to believe it, sitting on the edge of a raggedy red chair I used to have," the nostalgic Somers told reporters. "In fact, I still have it. Let me just... Here. I was right about here. That memory will be with me forever." Somers is also "pretty sure" he was over at his friend Dave's place in 2008 when the Giants won Super Bowl XLII, but noted, "That was a long time ago."
