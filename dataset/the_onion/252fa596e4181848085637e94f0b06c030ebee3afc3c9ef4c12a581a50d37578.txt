What do think? "Are you telling me that if a psycho wants a gun he'll have to go through the slight inconvenience of having to buy it from a friend?" Shelly Albeiz * Fitting Room Supervisor "Well, what if I befriend a gun store owner, and then what if the friendship becomes more important to either of us than the gun I was trying to buy? Wouldn't that be great?" Dino Dimuro * Unemployed "Ain't gonna stop Darryl." Maurice Molitor * Potato Chip Fryer
