WHIPPANY, NJ--Local mentally ill man Michael Redding, 26, announced his intention Thursday to display one or two further instances of troubling behavior before finally going ahead and carrying out what he has planned. "I'll do a couple more clearly disconcerting things in public locations in front of people who know who I am, then that's it--I'm going through with it," said the severely unstable man, noting that his increasingly erratic and worrisome conduct over the past few months has so far been ignored or gone unnoticed by his family, colleagues, and therapist. "Maybe I'll blow up and scream at an acquaintance for no reason, or I might just become totally unresponsive and withdrawn--who knows? All I can say is that I'll throw up about two more red flags and then it will be time." At press time, Redding reportedly finished publishing a set of disturbing thoughts on social media and verbally threatened a coworker, and is now ready to act on his plan.
