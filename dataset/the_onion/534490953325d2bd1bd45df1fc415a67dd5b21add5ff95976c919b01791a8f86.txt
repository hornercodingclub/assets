EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ--Lamenting that there simply isn't enough time to properly analyze the infinite facets of the upcoming championship game, sources within sports media confessed to reporters Tuesday that they aren't sure how they can possibly fit such a wide breadth of unique and entirely indispensable Super Bowl XLVIII coverage into just two short weeks. "You're telling me we're supposed to somehow hit the thousands upon thousands of pertinent and absolutely vital topics accompanying this pivotal Seahawks-Broncos title matchup in only 14 days--are you kidding me?" said executive producer Mark Gross, estimating that it would, under normal circumstances, take him and his colleagues several years to even begin addressing such thought-provoking matters as how the cold temperatures at the Meadowlands could impact gameplay; Richard Sherman's potentially hostile relationship with the Denver fans; and what a second ring might mean for Peyton Manning's legacy. "As it stands, even with round-the-clock coverage between now and next Sunday, there are simply more angles than we can possibly address. Everything we want--nay, need--to say about this game is all so very important, but we just don't have the time to give it the attention it deserves." Gross confirmed that the challenge of properly covering the Super Bowl will be made all the more difficult by sheer density of the material, which will inevitably force football pundits to repeat the same talking points dozens of times in the coming days.
