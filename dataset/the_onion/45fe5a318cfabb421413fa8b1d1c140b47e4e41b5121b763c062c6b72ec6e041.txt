PALMDALE, CA--In a career first for the 46-year-old star of the film franchise, actor Matt Damon appeared fully nude for a brief scene in the imagination of area man Phil Pressman, sources reported Monday. "I'd only ever seen Matt Damon appear bare-chested before, but then all of a sudden today, there he was stepping out of a shower," said Pressman, who added that, while eye-opening, Damon's nudity made perfect sense in the context of the thoughts he was having. "It was only for a few seconds, but wow, you saw everything. It was certainly a bold and intriguing step for him." Pressman went on to say that while appearing nude was obviously a departure for the Oscar winner, he would be comfortable with Damon doing it in his imagination more often, as the actor had absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.
