WASHINGTON--His heart racing in terror as he struggled to breathe, Vice President Mike Pence was reportedly flooded with panic Thursday before he realized the hand resting on his knee during a conference at the White House was his own. "Oh, thank God," thought a visibly relieved Pence, wiping away the droplets of sweat that had rapidly accumulated on his forehead. "That was close. Just to be safe, I should always keep a healthy gap between myself and the person seated next to me from now on. But, honestly, it's unacceptable for even my own hand to rest on my knee--it's the first wicked step on the path to a life of whoremongering." At press time, Pence had instructed aides to bind his wrists behind his back at the beginning of every meeting.
