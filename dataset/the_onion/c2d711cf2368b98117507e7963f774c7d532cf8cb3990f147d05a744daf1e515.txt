CANTON, OH--Noting the deep and genuine mutual fondness that fans of pornographic Japanese imagery have displayed in the site's comments, posts, and private messages, sources confirmed Wednesday that popular hentai message board YourHentaiWorld was home to a surprisingly close-knit and supportive user community. "Initially, I expected everyone would just recommend their favorite prepubescent catgirl manga, incest dating games, or good old tentacle sex videos, but I couldn't help noticing they knew each other extremely well," said 28-year-old shoe salesman and forum newcomer Adam Cantrell, who was surprised to find numerous discussion pages showcasing member artwork, organizing in-person meet ups, and simply catching up with other users' daily lives. "They seem to genuinely care about me, too--my inbox blew up with welcome messages when I joined, and when I linked to an amateur comic, I got almost as many 'Thank you' PMs as upvotes. Once, I forgot to post for a week and FilthyBoyKagayaku even started a thread to ask if anyone knew me IRL and could check if I was doing okay." As of press time, Cantrell was misting up while watching dozens of users offer aid and comfort to the original poster of the thread, "Need Help: Full-Package Futanari Not Doing It For Me Since Wife's Cancer Diagnosis."
