KANSAS CITY, MO--Eyewitnesses at Kansas City's Crown Center mall are reporting that a Gunman entered the shopping center's food court at approximately 10:30 a.m. today and killed zero people, leaving no additional casualties. "Come on, my last name is Gunman--what am I supposed to do?" said Macy's cashier Lisa Gunman, 33, currently the lead suspect in the non-homicides. "I really don't know what else to tell you, all right? God, I should have just kept my maiden name." At press time, the disgruntled Gunman was reportedly still at large. :
