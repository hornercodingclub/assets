JACKSONVILLE, FL--Completely ignoring the benefits of proper time management, the establishment of good field position, and patience, Jaguars fans heckled Jack Del Rio's sensible decision to punt on fourth and three Sunday, repeatedly shouting obscenities and even calling into question the head coach's sexual orientation. "Just fucking go for it, you pussies," Alex Lewis, 28, said during the second quarter of the Jaguars-Rams game. "Goddamn dumbass, we're on their fucking 45. Come on, idiots. Are we trying to win a football game here or what?" During the entirety of the game, jeering fans were also disgusted by the lack of randomly thrown challenge flags, onside kicks, and players haphazardly lateraling the football.
