LOS ANGELES--Saying he understands how excited everyone can get during an All-Star game, Spurs center Tim Duncan made it clear Saturday that since the game is held inside the Staples Center, he expects members of both teams to put their outside voices away and watch their volume for the big night. "Guys, seriously, if you don't know what an inside voice is, then just whisper and you should be fine," Duncan told his teammates during warm-ups, explaining that they were "well above a seven" and needed to bring it down to "about a three." "It's not like we're 10,000 feet apart from one another. I'm standing right here. I can hear you just fine." At press time, Duncan was seen hushing a fan in the mezzanine level who had been shouting, "Go Kobe!"
