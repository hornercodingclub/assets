LOS ANGELES--Fox Entertainment president Peter Liguori announced Thursday that the network is pulling the plug on , the new three-hour drama/comedy about two rival clubs competing for the coveted "pennant," just two shows into its run. "This uninspired series featured a cast of uninteresting characters, a hackneyed plot, and more boring narration than actual meaningful dialogue," Liguori said. "We tried to find an audience on Tuesdays, then on Wednesdays, and we were prepared to move its time slot to Friday nights or Saturday afternoons before ultimately realizing that the series had zero potential." Television experts cited several other possible reasons for the early cancellation, such as the overly expensive sets and costumes, the show's subject matter, and the fact that the series' projected breakout character--a brash, outspoken black man named Carl Everett--tested very poorly with audiences. Fox remains optimistic about its other fledgling program, , but critics say the series has "very little chance" of making it past seven episodes.
