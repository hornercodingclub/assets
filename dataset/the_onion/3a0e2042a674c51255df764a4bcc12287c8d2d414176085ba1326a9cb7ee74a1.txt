NEW YORK--Aiming to transition seamlessly from her current position, college senior Molly Black is holding out hope that her current internship with BrownLink Media will lead to a class-action lawsuit, sources confirmed Monday. "I spend 12-hour days here, six days a week, so I think I have a decent shot of leveraging this experience directly into a legal battle against the company," said Black, 21, adding that working through her legally mandated lunch hour would likely further increase her chances of staying on long-term as a plaintiff in a multiyear trial. "I think if I keep my nose to the grindstone like this, there's a pretty good chance I'll get a slice of a huge settlement. Hopefully I'll impress attorneys enough to make all this hard work worthwhile." Black added that if the class-action lawsuit didn't pan out, there was still an outside chance she'd be a good candidate for sexual harassment litigation.
