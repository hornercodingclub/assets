SAN FRANCISCO--With the 49ers outside linebacker entering rehab earlier this week, multiple sources expressed concerns Friday that Aldon Smith's indefinite leave of absence would absolutely cripple San Francisco's bar scene. "You just can't replace a guy like Aldon," said Mission District bar owner Hank Reynolds, adding that Smith's dominant presence during two-for-one rails and taps night would be greatly missed. "You can hope that somebody steps up to fill the void, but our business just isn't as shored up with an All-Pro drinker like that out of the mix." Unsure when or if Smith will return, local bar owners reportedly expressed hope that the linebacker is able to return without missing so much as a beat and get right back into his position as the anchor of the San Francisco drinking economy.
