Former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner of New York, who resigned from office in 2011 after accidentally sharing a photograph of a visible erection in his underwear on Twitter, has said he is considering running for New York City mayor this year. What do think? "Let he who hath not tweeted a picture of his erect penis cast the first stone."

Sybil Lykins * Accident Report Clerk "I fail to see the humor in all of this. Oh, wait. Now I get it." Elliot Colean * Fire Eater
