NEW YORK--Several new reports indicate CBS producers are just assuming that analyst Shannon Sharpe is doing game highlights right now, speculating that the broadcaster's incoherent rambling might be related to one of the top plays from Sunday. "Uh, he's mumbling about something, but I don't know what the hell he's babbling about," said producer Drew Kaliski, who was visibly weary while struggling to follow along with Sharpe's unfathomable commentary. "I think I heard 'Luck' in there somewhere. It doesn't matter; just throw a touchdown on the screen." At press time, CBS producers reportedly determined that Sharpe was probably never going to shut up.
