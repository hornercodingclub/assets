MEMPHIS--Grizzlies players expressed frustration during a press conference Monday, admitting they regretted having gone to bed early and missed out on seeing one of the most improbable comebacks in NBA history as the Clippers overcame a 27-point deficit to defeat the Grizzlies 99-98. "We thought the game was over, just like I'm sure everybody else did, so we decided to hit the sack. I'm pissed, because it would have been cool to see such a once-in-a-lifetime finish," said small forward Rudy Gay, who was already resting up for his Wednesday game against Los Angeles when the buzzer sounded on the Clippers' comeback. "That kind of determination and refusal to give up would have been pretty inspiring for our team to see, especially now that we're down a game in the playoffs." Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins is standing by his decision to send the team to bed early, claiming he hates it when players are tired and grumpy during practice.
