According to students at Liberty University who spoke to BuzzFeed News, the conservative Christian university chose to host Ted Cruz's presidential campaign announcement during one of the school's mandatory convocations held three times per week, which resident students must attend or else pay a $10 fine, a decision that some students criticized as sending the message that the student body endorses Cruz. What do think? "You have to admit, the mandatory standing ovation was pretty rousing." Floyd Dowdy * Hay Sorter "I thought those thousands of young people were simply drawn there by the inescapable pull of Cruz Mania." Russell Pauley * Dairy Powder Mixer "I'd pay $10 to not have to listen to Ted Cruz." Christine McDaniel * Daycare Supervisor
