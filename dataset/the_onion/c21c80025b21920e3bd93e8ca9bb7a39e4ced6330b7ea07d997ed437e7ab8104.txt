FOXBOROUGH, MA--Saying that "he can barely keep track of all those guys," New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady promised yesterday that, by the end of the month, he will have learned all the names of his ever-changing receiving corps. "No. 10  [Jabar Gaffney] runs a pretty good out pattern and No. 87, Rick something [Reche Caldwell], he seems like a real nice guy," Brady said when was asked how he was dealing with the departures of wide receivers Deion Branch and David Givens. "Truthfully, the great thing about this offense--and this whole team, really--is that people don't have to know anybody's name in order for things to go smoothly. In fact, Coach [Bill] Belichick encourages us not to get too attached to one another." Brady added that the last time he took the time to learn the name of one of his receivers, he was gone the following day.
