Voters in Utah have passed an amendment to remove a provision from the state constitution that allows slavery or involuntary servitude if it is as punishment for a crime. What do think?

Tom Musso * Fish Handler "Hopefully, this will lead to slavery one day being outlawed at the federal level." Clyde Boucher * Unemployed "I sure hope Utahans are ready to experience a massive crime wave." Tina Shepherd * Corporate Chiropractor
