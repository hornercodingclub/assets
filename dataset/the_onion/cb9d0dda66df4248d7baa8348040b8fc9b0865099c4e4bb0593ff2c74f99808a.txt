WASHINGTON--In an appeal for the strengthening of the world's greatest hobbies, Hobby Lobby representative Robbie H. Stobby vowed today to press for funding of a full range of hobbies. "My name is Robbie Stobby, and I am here to lobby for hobbies," said Stobby from the Congressional lobby, accompanied by his wife, Elise Tobbie-Stobby. "This snobby Congress needs to quit being knobby and recognize the Hobby Lobby. Well, I say it's as bad as if we were under Mugabe. And, to diverge for a moment, the Kennedy I like best is Bobby. He was a great legislator and a significant influence on my political career." Stobby then exited the stage for a meeting with Iraq's Ahmed Chalabi, to discuss funding the hobbies of the Australian Kabi Kabi.
