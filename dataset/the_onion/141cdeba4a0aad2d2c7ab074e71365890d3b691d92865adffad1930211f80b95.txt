NEW YORK--Saying its classic but comfortable fashions should be for everyone, clothing retailer J.Crew unveiled on Wednesday a new line of stylish casualwear specifically designed for mannequins. "Whether they're hanging out with friends in a window display or standing motionless by the entrance to a menswear section, our new 'Dolled Up' apparel line offers ageless, timeless looks for the modern mannequin," said J.Crew creative director Jenna Lyons, adding that the clothes have been specially hand-dyed in colors that complement mannequins' stark white skin while the lightweight madras and chambray fabrics won't weigh down their hollow fiberglass frames. "We've tailored these garments to subtly accentuate the nubs where hands and feet should be, but we've also manufactured them to be durable enough to withstand being stretched against a permanently bent elbow." At press time, J.Crew's mannequin line was discontinued after selling far below expectations.
