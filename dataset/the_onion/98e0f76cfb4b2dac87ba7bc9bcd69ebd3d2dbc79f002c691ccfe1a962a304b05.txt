BOCA RATON, FL--After asserting during Monday's foreign policy debate that Americans needed a president who would "finally stand up to China," Republican nominee Mitt Romney responded to a question on international trade by looking intently into the television camera and addressing Beijing's leaders in their native language. "As president, I will crack down on China, and I'd like to make one thing clear to President Hu [Jintao] right now," the candidate said before locking his gaze on the camera and issuing a stern set of remarks in perfectly accented Mandarin.  Jabbing a finger at the camera as he concluded his statement, Romney held his firm, unbroken glare for several seconds before tersely ordering debate moderator Bob Schieffer to move on to the next question.
