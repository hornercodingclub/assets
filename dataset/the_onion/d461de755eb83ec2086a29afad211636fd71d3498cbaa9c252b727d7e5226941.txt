HARTFORD, CT--During a panel presentation about his company's recent 76 percent quarterly profit spike, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini disclosed Monday that the key to increasing earnings in an era of ballooning costs continues to hinge on not paying for customers' medical care. "The secret to running a thriving multi-billion-dollar company like Aetna is in the cultivation of a loyal consumer base whose medical needs you rarely, if ever, pay for," said Bertolini, who went on to advise young entrepreneurs to first build financial reserves through a business model in which subscribers spend an exorbitant amount each month for prescriptions, doctor visits, and surgical procedures, and then preserve their capital by exercising all due diligence and consistency by never paying for expensive, profit-deflating exigencies such as prescriptions, doctor visits, and surgical procedures. "If you want broad profit margins in today's constricted marketplace, all you need to do is find a market which you can offer absolutely nothing while taking all of your customers' money. That describes today's modern health insurance market to an uncanny degree--In 2017, our largest customer-facing expense was advertising." At press time, Aetna's stock value rose by 6 percent as the company announced a premium hike.
