KABUL, AFGHANISTAN--Waving flags and breaking into cheers the moment they spotted the veteran, dozens of joyous citizens gave Marine Pfc. Victor Rosas, 23, a hero's welcome back to Afghanistan, sources reported Tuesday. "I've been counting down the hours until Victor came back, and here he is at last!" said local food vendor Anwar Ahmadzai, one of the many familiar faces the young soldier had not seen for the 14 months he was overseas in the U.S. "There were some people who worried we might not ever see him again, but I never doubted this day would come, not for one minute. Now he just needs some time to relax and start settling back into his old life." Wiping a tear from his eye, Ahmadzai added that he hoped Rosas would stay much longer than he did last time.
