HARTFORD, CT--Employees at Trustwell Insurance expressed shock and embarrassment Monday upon noticing that senior sales associate Mark Hansel had a visibly flaccid penis just sitting there underneath his khaki pants and was making absolutely zero effort to conceal it from his colleagues. "It was like, Christ, we can totally tell that your limp penis is right there behind a layer of fabric, Mark, and you don't even have the decency to cover yourself up?" accounts analyst Alexis Crawford told reporters, adding that she forced herself to look away out of politeness after seeing Hansel's completely unerect penis just hanging there, concealed beneath his khakis. "His flaccid genitals were practically staring us all in the face, covered in nothing but his khaki pants, and presumably a pair of boxers or briefs of some kind. And yet Mark didn't try to sit down or block our view with a file folder or anything. I mean, good Lord, I didn't come to work to see a peep show." At press time, numerous office sources were considering reporting Hansel's actions to corporate as an act of sexual harassment.
