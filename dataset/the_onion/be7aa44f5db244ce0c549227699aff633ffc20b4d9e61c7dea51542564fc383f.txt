QUINCY, MA--Saying she would stop looking at her phone and tablet at least an hour before going to sleep, local woman Carina Anielski, who drinks six cups of coffee per day, told reporters Tuesday that she was trying to cut down on blue light around bedtime. "I heard that too much blue light can really mess with your circadian rhythm, so I'm going to keep it way down," said Anielski, who consumes a full 12 ounces of highly caffeinated beverage roughly every two hours between the cup she has upon arriving at work and the cup she consumes after dinner. "I've also put a filter on all my devices that blocks out blue light, so I've got an added layer of protection. Seriously, one blast of that stuff at the wrong time and I'm wide awake till four in the morning. I have to take some precautions." At press time, Anielski, who also drinks at least six Diet Cokes every day, was shutting down her laptop promptly at 9 p.m.
