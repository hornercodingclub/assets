CHARLOTTE, NC--Despite being only a week away from the end of a season in which they have lost more than 50 games, the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats are, for reasons unknown at this time, still meeting regularly to practice. "As far as I can tell, they were eliminated from the playoffs some time in February," Bobcats practice facility security guard Fran Kirkland said Thursday, noting that the team has already secured the league's worst record of the season. "But they still show up here with all their equipment like it's business as usual, pass the ball around, run shooting drills, even break a sweat--I swear to God." Sources close to the Bobcats were unable to confirm if there is some sort of league rule that requires teams to practice or if Charlotte is simply preparing to play some other sport that uses practice drills similar to those employed in basketball.
