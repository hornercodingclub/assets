COLUMBUS, OH--Announcing a new program designed to encourage the presence of women in the workplace, Central Ohio Heating & Cooling has encouraged employees to participate in next Friday's first annual Bring Your Daughter's Friend To Work Day. "This event is an excellent opportunity for you to bring in your daughter's friend--the one she plays soccer with--and let her see how a real company works while giving her the chance to meet and spend time with other employees," a company-wide memo urged all staffers. "Space is limited, so please make your plans now to ensure a spot for the friend. The blonde one, not the tall brown-haired one." The memo added that if the friend happens to have soccer practice after the workday ends, she can just show up already in her uniform.
