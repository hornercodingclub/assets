HELENA, MT--Promising unspoiled nature and a relaxing escape from the hectic rigors of city life, a new Montana tourism advertising campaign that debuted this week is reportedly marketed toward urban bison. "We want Montana to be the only destination a bison thinks of when they need to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city," Montana Office of Tourism head Brian Kinnard said of the $5 million campaign, which consists of billboards and advertisements placed in subways and bus stops in Chicago, New York, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. in order to reach city-dwelling bison. "Montana offers expansive views, fresh local food, and gorgeous national parks where bison can reconnect with nature and spend quality time with family or friends." Kinnard told reporters that most bison visiting Montana would probably never want to go back to the city after getting out into the open and realizing they could look around in any direction and not see a single person.
