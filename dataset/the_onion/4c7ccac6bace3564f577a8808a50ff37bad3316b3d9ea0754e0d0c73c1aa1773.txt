CLEVELAND--With draft day fast approaching, Cleveland Cavaliers general manager David Griffin told reporters Monday that he believes prospective number-one pick Joel Embiid is the perfect player to build a medical team around. "When I look at Joel, I see a basketball player who has exactly what we need to take our medical team to the next level," said Griffin, emphasizing that Embiid represents a core around which Cleveland can bring together a skilled group of doctors, surgeons, and physical therapists. "He's the nucleus. When you've got an athlete like that, you put your medical personnel in place to do great things. Sure, [2013 draft pick] Anthony Bennett led to us getting an expert orthopedist, but having Joel on our roster will allow us to put in place a solid team of medical professionals who will thrive here for years to come." Griffin added that, provided both Embiid and his physicians perform as expected this season, the Cavaliers will be in the perfect position to once again secure the number-one overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft.
