NEW YORK--Recommending that players take advantage of an opportunity that would keep them from falling behind their peers, officials from the NFL announced Monday that they are offering a summer league for those who were suspended during the regular season to make up games. "Players who missed any time due to suspension are strongly advised to sign up for our summer league in order to ensure they're prepared to continue on to the following season," said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, explaining that players will be expected to attend practice five days a week from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. throughout June and July, as well as participate in make-up games every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday so league officials can evaluate their progress. "It's obviously an accelerated program with no breaks or bye weeks, since we're squeezing a full 16-game regular season into just a couple of months. However, we will still offer a full schedule of make-up games--afternoon and primetime alike--for all divisions, so that players who missed large parts of last season can get back on track. By the time the 2016 season rolls around next fall, they will be fully up to speed alongside the rest of their teammates." Sources also confirmed that, despite having not received any suspensions this season, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton has already signed up for the summer league just to get ahead for next year.
