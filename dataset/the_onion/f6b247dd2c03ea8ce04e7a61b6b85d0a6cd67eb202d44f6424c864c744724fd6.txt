While visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, pop star Justin Bieber wrote in the museum's guestbook that the famous diarist and Holocaust victim was a "great girl" and that he hoped "she would have been a Belieber," using a common term for his fans. What do think? "Who cares? I've been telling people Anne Frank would have loved my carpet-cleaning business for years." Ty Richards * Carpet Cleaner "Thank God. I visited the Anne Frank House that same day, and I wrote something far more offensive." Wilbert McBride * Systems Analyst "Let the haters hate, but if this stops one Bieber fan from rounding up and slaughtering a Jewish family it'll all be worth it." Misha Trumbull * Casino Dealer
