TEHRAN--In an unprecedented display of international cooperation from the Middle Eastern nation, Iran reportedly pledged to end the country's burgeoning nuclear weapons program in exchange for detailed schematics for the construction of an atomic bomb. "In the spirit of compromise, the nation of Iran promises that, should a Western nation supply us with blueprints for the design and assembly of a fission bomb, we will immediately put a stop to our nuclear initiative," said Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling the terms of this proposed agreement "fair, equitable, and well within reason." "Of course, we'll also need detonators and a launching mechanism, as well as the expert guidance of the world's top physicists and engineers. But once we have that, our nuclear weapons program will be a thing of the past. You have my word on that." At press time, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had persuaded Ahmadinejad to accept a "more reasonable" offer of $50 million in nuclear research funding and 200 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium.
