BALTIMORE--Orioles designated hitter Jim Thome was forced to leave in the fourth inning of Sunday's game against the Boston Red Sox after complaining about tightness in his pants. "Something just didn't feel right and I could barely walk," said Thome, who caused concern for teammates and coaches as he grimaced while gingerly ambling off the field. "It really pinched in the thighs and restricted movement in my legs. It even hurt to sit. I hope this doesn't keep me out of the lineup for too long. The trainers tried to help me stretch out the fabric but it was still awfully stiff." Thome, who has suffered from chronic trouseritis for much of his career, received good news Monday when the MRI revealed that the 42-year-old did not tear his pants.
