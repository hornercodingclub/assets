EUGENE, OR--Arriving back at work after a two-week winter vacation, local marketing assistant Matthew Bueso told reporters Monday he was happy to return to the office with a fresh and rejuvenated loathing for his job. "It's always nice to get away for a few weeks, clear my head, and come back invigorated with a newfound disgust for my place of employment and the various responsibilities of my thoroughly depressing job," said Bueso, 38, noting that his time away had inspired him to complete mind-numbing administrative tasks, engage in idle discussions with his aggravating coworkers, and listen to bullshit inspirational speeches from his boss with a rekindled sense of anger and despair. "I'm rested, my batteries are recharged, and I'm ready to despise my entire professional life more intensely than ever before!" At press time, a revitalized Bueso was furiously balling his fists at the sound of a nearby coworker's loud typing.
