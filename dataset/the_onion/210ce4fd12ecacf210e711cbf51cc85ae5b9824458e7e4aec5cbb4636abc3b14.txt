BALTIMORE--In preparation for the highly anticipated AFC playoff game with the Denver Broncos, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco announced Thursday that he is already working on an apology that will express heartfelt regret for the ignoble ending to retiring linebacker Ray Lewis's career. "I've been plugging away on a couple of drafts this week, but I definitely want to focus on what a great teammate Ray has been and how bad I feel that he's going out like this," said Flacco, adding that Lewis "deserves better" than to force and recover a critical fourth-quarter Denver fumble only to watch helplessly from the sidelines as Flacco throws a pick-six interception on the following play, bringing the future Hall of Famer's 17-year NFL career to a discouraging close. "Once I've got it all worked out, I'm thinking I'll apologize before kickoff, because he definitely won't want to hear from me after all those muffed snaps." According to team sources, Flacco's apology to Lewis is just one of many being contemplated by the quarterback, who is reportedly working on separate offerings of remorse to teammates, coaches, and Ravens ownership for Saturday's loss, as well as to the city of Baltimore for the six-year contract extension he will receive this offseason.
