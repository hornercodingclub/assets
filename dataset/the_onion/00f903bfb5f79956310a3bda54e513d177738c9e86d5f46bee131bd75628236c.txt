WASHINGTON--Saying they simply needed something to direct their anger toward, the nation's frenzied Donald Trump supporters admitted Thursday that, if circumstances were different, they would be just as happy tearing the Republican frontrunner to pieces. "To be honest, I'm just violently mad, and Trump's done a great job of pointing me in the direction of things to wreck--although, if things change and I end up mercilessly ripping into Trump instead of rabidly backing him, that would be just fine too," said Nashua, NH resident Jeff Waldman, echoing the sentiments of hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters nationwide, each of whom confirmed that they ultimately just wanted to be part of something destructive, whether it was at a pro-Trump rally, an anti-Trump rally, or some other outlet for their bitterness and indignation. "You've got to hand it to the guy for helping me channel my all-consuming rage about my own lot in life into ruthless attacks on immigrant families, women, and the other presidential candidates. But really, there's no reason I couldn't unleash that vicious energy on Trump himself. Either way, I get to yell." Trump's supporters added that, if all else failed, they could always go back to directing their blinding fury at their spouses and children.
