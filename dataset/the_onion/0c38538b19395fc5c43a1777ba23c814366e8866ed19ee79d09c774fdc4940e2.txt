BOSTON--Known throughout the NBA as an extremely territorial player, Kevin Garnett asserted his dominance over his Boston-area kitchen and dining room with an aggressively vocal statement Sunday. "This is my house! You hear me? Mine! This is where I watch my TV and eat my cereal! Where I eat cereal every day!" said the 2004 Most Valuable Player, punctuating his house-proud remarks by slapping his chest and the countertop between his coffeemaker and toaster. "You don't just bring your stuff in here! You call me and ask--politely--if you can drop by. You gotta respect my house! Because I take care of it and clean it at least once a week! I'm thinking about adding another wing, maybe a film room! What do you think?!? You think a film room would be nice?!?" Garnett then asked the assembled reporters not to print his exact address so that the Mavericks would not be able to bother him.
