PITTSBURGH-- After Ben Roethlisberger repeatedly addressed his Pittsburgh teammates as "dude," "Mac," and "you there" for an entire practice session last Monday, the quarterback's fellow Steelers concluded that the oft-concussed Pro Bowler is unable to remember their names. "I walked up to him in the locker room and said, 'Hey Ben,' and he responded, 'Hey...brother,'"said a teammate who spoke on the condition of continued anonymity. "He only used a first name once, and that was when he was talking to Troy Polamalu. And he kept calling him Randy." When asked if he would be ready for Sunday's game, Roethlisberger said that as the third-string goalie, there is only so much he could do.
