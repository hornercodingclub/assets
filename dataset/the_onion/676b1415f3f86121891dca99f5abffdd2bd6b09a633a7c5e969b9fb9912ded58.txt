INDIANAPOLIS--Stressing the difficulty of following in the footsteps of an all-time legend, Colts quarterback Andrew Luck vowed Thursday to bring Indianapolis fans another great pizza ad. "It's been far too long since Colts fans have been able to call a pizza ad campaign their own, but I'm going to do my best to bring them the high-quality commercials they deserve," said Luck, explaining that he always dreamed of standing on the soundstage and proudly holding up a slice of pepperoni pizza just like one of his heros. "Peyton Manning gave Indianapolis one of the best pizza promotion runs the NFL has ever seen. I may not be able to live up to that, but Colts fans should know I'm reading scripts and working on my pie-flipping mechanics every day to make sure I honor his legacy." At press time, Luck was projected to be out for the rest of the season after tearing his rotator cuff while opening a pizza box.
