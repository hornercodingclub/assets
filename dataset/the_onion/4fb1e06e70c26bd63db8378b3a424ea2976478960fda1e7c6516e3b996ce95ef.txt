Yoplait yogurt has evidently been posing a risk to wildlife due to the product's tapered cup and foil lid, with animal advocates citing an especially high death toll among skunks whose muzzles get stuck in the containers and suffocate, a problem that Yoplait has allegedly known about since 1998 but has done little to address.
