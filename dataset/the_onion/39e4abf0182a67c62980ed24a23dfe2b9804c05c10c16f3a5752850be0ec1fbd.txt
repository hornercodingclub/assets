WASHINGTON--Associate Justice Antonin Scalia struggled to recall the names of all nine active Supreme Court justices while playing a trivia game Thursday, sources confirmed. "Let's see, there's Breyer, um...Ginsburg. Pretty sure that's one. And, uh, there's that guy with the bow tie and the pinched face," said Scalia, noting that his difficulty in answering stemmed largely from the significant turnover on the nation's highest court since he memorized the names of its members in high school. "I can picture him in the photo, but what's his name? Oh, I remember Clarence Thomas, of course, because of the Anita Hill thing, and then there's that Mexican woman with the name that's impossible to pronounce. And...Kerrigan?" After initially declining offers of a hint, Scalia reportedly caved in and asked if someone could just give him the first couple letters of each justice's last name.
