MENLO PARK, CA--Saying that he thought it was a "safe bet" at first, local man Mark Zuckerberg, 28, told reporters Tuesday that--after going what he called "all in" on the business--he now regrets staking so much of his financial future on the Internet company Facebook.  "It seemed like a slam dunk--popular company, kids love it, and my financial advisors were telling me this stock was going to be a monster," said Zuckerberg, who works in computers, and has lost nearly $600 million since Facebook went public in May. "But you know what, I'll admit there was always a small part of me that knew I was going to lose a boatload on this thing, because, when you think about Facebook, there's not a whole lot of room for long-term growth there, or any real solid plan for the future. I guess it's just another one of those overhyped tech stocks, and I bought into the hype." At press time, Zuckerberg sold his shares in Facebook and invested in GE, which the computer programmer and husband called "a fine, safe American company that never gets too high, never gets too low."
