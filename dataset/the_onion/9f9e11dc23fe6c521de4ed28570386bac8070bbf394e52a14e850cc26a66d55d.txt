MIAMI--After struggling to find his rhythm during the two plays he actually spent on the field last Sunday, Dolphins quarterback Chad Pennington finally looked like his old self against the Bears Thursday night, sitting on the bench with a season-ending shoulder injury. "He was poised and comfortable out there--like the Pennington of old," said receiver Brandon Marshall, who caught three passes for 41 yards from quarterback Tyler Thigpen. "Watching him move up and down the sideline with his arm in a sling congratulating players as they came off the field reminded me how effective Chad can really be." Pennington's trademark style of play is expected to cause him to retire in the next few weeks.
