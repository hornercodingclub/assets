Arizona State University will cover the medical costs of a city councilman who was hospitalized for four days after ASU mascot Sparky the Sun Devil leapt onto his back and tore a muscle that was still healing from a recent back surgery.

Reed Cullom * Paste Mixer "When you've got a devil for a mascot, you'd better keep your checkbook handy." Wendy Bohr * Ring Molder "Yeah, but how pumped was that crowd?" Geoff Richards * Blade Sharpener
