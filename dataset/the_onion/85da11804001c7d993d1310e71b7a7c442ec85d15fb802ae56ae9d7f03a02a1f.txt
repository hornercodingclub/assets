NEW YORK--Saying the comparisons are "unbelievably flattering," New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez told reporters Friday that he is extremely humbled to currently be mentioned in the same breath as all-time baseball greats Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds, and Jose Canseco. "When you talk about the likes of Bonds, McGwire, and Canseco, you're talking about some of the best hitters who ever played the game, and to be in the same company as those players is pretty incredible," said Rodriguez, adding that "it's a true honor" to also be likened to other sports icons such as cyclist Lance Armstrong and Olympic sprinter Ben Johnson. "I've seen some people put me up there with [Sammy] Sosa and Manny [Ramirez], and I really don't know what to say. These guys are baseball legends--heroes, really--and hearing my name said alongside theirs is pretty overwhelming." Rodriguez later admitted to sources that he doesn't understand the comparisons between himself and Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, claiming that he's "a totally different player."
