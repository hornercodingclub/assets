LONDON--Pushed out of power as the damning charges mounted, Alex DeLarge was forced to step down Wednesday as leader of the Droogs amidst allegations of sexual misconduct. "In an unfortunate development, we have been forced to remove Mr. DeLarge from his post due to the startling accusations of sexual impropriety that have come to light," said Droog member Georgie, explaining that although the group had systems in place to swiftly address such allegations, it clearly did not adequately follow those procedures. "Even though these acts took place decades ago, it does not excuse Alex's heinous and unforgivable actions. This is not at all what the Droogs stand for." At press time, DeLarge had offered to undergo two weeks of rigorous aversion therapy to rehabilitate himself.
