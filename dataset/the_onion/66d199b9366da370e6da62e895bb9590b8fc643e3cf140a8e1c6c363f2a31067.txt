Examining the genre's century-long rise through a 16-hour, 8-part documentary, Ken Burns' premiered on Sunday to critical acclaim that lauded the series' ability to celebrate the musical form's history while discussing its more fraught roots. What do think? "I don't really care for country music, but then again, I was against the Vietnam war before I saw the documentary, and now I love it." Eric Chase * Denim Distresser "That's a shame. I like every genre of documentary except ones about country or rap." Hilda Spencer * Speed Reader "I'll only tune in if you can absolutely guarantee me that it will include a pan-and-zoom over a sepia-toned photograph of a steel guitar." Aidan O'Connor * Mannequin Duster
