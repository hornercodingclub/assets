EL PASO, TX--Revealing plans to "put his own spin" on beloved stump speeches and talking points, Beto O'Rourke announced Thursday that he was starting a Barack Obama cover campaign. "I've always loved Barack's early stuff from back in '08, even '04, and I think diehard fans will go crazy when I cover all his greatest hits," said the 46-year-old White House hopeful, clarifying that he and his campaign aides had spent several months "just going through Barack's catalog" to memorize the former president's platform. "Obama's style always really resonated with me, and honestly, what's the point in struggling to come up with something new when you can just give people what they want. I'm going to cover some of Barack's most well-known campaign speeches, putting my own small twists on prison reform and healthcare--they'll be way heavier, faster, and louder." At press time, O'Rourke revealed that he had just finished working on a stripped-down version of "Change We Can Believe In" that went directly into a fiery rendition of "Yes, We Can!"
