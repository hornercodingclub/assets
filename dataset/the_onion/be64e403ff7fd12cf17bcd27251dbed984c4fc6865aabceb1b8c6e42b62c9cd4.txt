COLUMBIA, SC--Shooing away protesters from the brown, debris-covered lawn, state lawmakers reportedly refused Monday to remove the Confederate flag from South Carolina's Capitol Trailer. "Go on, git!" said shirtless South Carolina state representative Jeff Duncan, who sources confirmed tossed an empty 40-ounce bottle of Colt 45 at a group of demonstrators while reclining in a battered, dirt-caked plastic kiddie pool. "Y'all quit messing with our capitol trailer. You ain't never gonna see this flag come down, you hear? Now, get on outta here unless you wanna get real well acquainted with my shotgun." At press time, a two-thirds majority of South Carolina state legislators had reportedly passed out amongst the rusted washing machine and a sink on the grass in front of the state's double-wide trailer.
