PALM BEACH, FL--Following an extravagant wedding ceremony attended by hundreds of famous guests, former NBA star Michael Jordan inadvertently left for his honeymoon with one of his mistresses, sources confirmed Wednesday. "Damn it, I'm never going to hear the end of this shit," said Jordan, who reportedly noticed that the woman sitting next to him on a private jet bound for Viceroy, Anguilla was not his new bride Yvette Prieto. "Christ, she's going to be so pissed when she finds out I spent our two-week honeymoon with Candy." At press time, Jordan had reportedly told his mistress that he regretted not going on his honeymoon with the "sexy, young" waitress from the wedding reception.
