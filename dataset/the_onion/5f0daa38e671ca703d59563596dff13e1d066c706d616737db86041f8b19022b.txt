INDIANAPOLIS--With the 2013 NFL Scouting Combine drawing to a close, linebacker Manti Te'o confirmed Tuesday that he had managed to scrape together enough money to pay the $5,000 fee to participate in the event. "The guy on the phone told me my results wouldn't count unless I paid the registration fee, so I made sure to get him that money as soon as I could," the former Notre Dame football standout told reporters, adding that his Western Union wire transfer to Flex-Trak OKK Offshore Holdings, Ltd. ensured him free access to each of the combine performance tests, as well as "Premier Elite" admission to Lucas Oil Stadium. "It was a little pricey with all the extra convenience charges tacked on, but it's a good thing I got the money together when I did. Apparently, the fee would have increased to $10,000 if I had waited another day." While Te'o admitted that registering for the combine had depleted a significant portion of his savings, the star linebacker said that his finances were in good shape, as he recently received an unexpected e-mail informing him that he had inherited a sizable sum of money from a long-lost Nigerian uncle.
