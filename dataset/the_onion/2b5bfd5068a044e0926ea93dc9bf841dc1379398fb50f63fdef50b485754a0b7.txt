JACKSONVILLE, FL--Claiming that it "doesn't really make a difference," Jacksonville Jaguars officials announced Saturday they plan to play the 2012 season without a head coach. "We took a look at our roster, our support staff, even ourselves as management, and basically determined the difference between having a head coach and not having one to be negligible," said general manager Gene Smith, adding that recent hire Mike Mularkey still hadn't shown up to work yet, and nobody within the Jaguars organization could blame him. "Maybe we'll lose two or three more games, but ultimately our head coach is just going to wind up a scapegoat, and we'd rather not put anybody in that position." Smith concluded the press conference by saying that given its recent history with the position, the team is also assessing whether or not it needs a quarterback this year.
