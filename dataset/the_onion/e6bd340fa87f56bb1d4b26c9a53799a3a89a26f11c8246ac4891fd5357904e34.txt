SAN FRANCISCO--Users of the popular reference website Wikipedia were reportedly surprised this week upon discovering that the online encyclopedia contained no entry for Beatles co-founder and legendary singer-songwriter John Lennon. "John Lennon sold over a billion records and influenced an entire generation, so I guess I just figured he would have his own Wikipedia page," said Collin Acker, 34, after clicking on a red link bearing Lennon's name, which directed him to a page indicating that an entry on the iconic songwriter behind "All You Need Is Love" and "Imagine" did not exist but that he could create one. "All the other Beatles are on here. Hell, Yoko [Ono] is on here. Even Pete Best has 12 whole sections on his page. Huh." At press time, Acker was reading the extensive Wikipedia page on musician Sean Lennon, which referred to his superstar father only once as "John Lennon, father, deceased."
