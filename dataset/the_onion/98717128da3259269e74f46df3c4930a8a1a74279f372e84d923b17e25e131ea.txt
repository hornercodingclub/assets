BRISTOL, CT--Sensing the 9-year-old is now old enough to engage in a heated debate on the subject, Stephen A. Smith reportedly decided Monday that his son is finally ready for the argument. "It's a big milestone in every father-son relationship to sit your child down and dispute his pathetic ideas about the birds and bees," said Smith, fondly remembering his own father belligerently talking over him when he got the sex argument as a boy. "He's at that age where he's starting to hear some things about sex at school, so it's important for me as a parent to corner him on his logical inconsistencies and force him to admit he doesn't have the experience to know what the hell he's talking about." Smith said he is ready to have the argument as soon as his son gets home from school and can get in front of a camera.
