FOXBOROUGH, MA--Patriots head coach and respected tactician Bill Belichick set various and seemingly random events in motion Monday that he believes will culminate in a brilliant misdirection play during his team's Nov. 14 contest against the Pittsburgh Steelers. "Okay, we need to be working on the long-term details this week, especially our pulling-guard schemes, our wide receiver blocking, the routes we take when we drive to work, and the precise times when we walk our dogs and water our plants," said Belichick, writing each item on a whiteboard under the heading "STEELERS/SPECIAL PACKAGE" before suddenly pausing, looking his team directly in the eyes, and saying cryptically, "Or do we?" "If any of you are seen entering the Shop 'n Save in [Pittsburgh neighborhood] Squirrel Hill next Monday, it's off, and we meet back here at exactly 8:17 p.m." Analysts said the subtlety of Belichick's game-planning cannot be underestimated, and his actions may in fact be a clever smoke screen designed to mask a run-of-the-mill seven-yard slant pass against Detroit on Nov. 25.
