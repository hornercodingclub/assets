ELK GROVE VILLAGE, IL--Shedding new light on just how happy life could have been if things had worked out a little differently, a new report published Wednesday has concluded that it sure would've been nice if Dad had loved his original family as much as his second one. "You can really see he's an empathetic person who takes a genuine interest in these kids, and it's amazing to think about what it would have been like to have had some of that back when we were children," sources are quoted as saying in the report, which noted just how cool it would have been if the kindness Dad showed toward his current wife at Thanksgiving dinner had been applied to Mom even once over the 12-year span of their marriage. "It's touching to watch him spend time nurturing the talents and hobbies of his new kids, but I don't think he even knows what I do for work. He also named his new son after himself, something he didn't bother doing when my brother and I were born more than 20 years ago. I don't think he even helped pick our names." The report went on to state it also would've been nice if Dad hadn't asked sources to get out of a second photo taken over the holiday so he could have one with just his new family.
