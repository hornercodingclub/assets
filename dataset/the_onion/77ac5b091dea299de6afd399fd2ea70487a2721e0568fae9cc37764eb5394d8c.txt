TALLAHASSEE, FL--Staring down in shock and turning pale, the host of Wednesday night's $700 million Powerball lottery reportedly muttered to herself in utter horror after the randomized drawing produced an entirely unmarked, pitch-black ball. "32, 16--Oh, dear God.... No, no, no," said Powerball host Laura Johnson, who trembled visibly as the black and otherwise featureless ball came to a rest at the end of the machine's display tube.

They said we'd ... oh no, no--" At press time, viewers of the drawing reported seeing the studio lights flicker followed by an unearthly scream just as the televised feed cut to static.
