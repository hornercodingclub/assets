ROUND ROCK, TX--In a remarkable demonstration of expertise, Round Rock Express designated hitter Manny Ramirez reportedly wowed his triple-A teammates Friday with his expansive knowledge of basic geometric shapes. "See, that one is a circle, and it's made from the roundest stuff in the whole world--billions of super-tiny curves that you can't see with your eyes, man," said Ramirez, who also excitedly pointed out a square, diamond, number, glove, and cap shape. "I like all the shapes, but the triangle is the best and my favorite because it has a bunch of sides and super-pointy parts. Triangles are expensive, man. Squares aren't as fancy, but they are still really good shapes." At press time, players on the Round Rock Express confirmed that Ramirez had taught them about several new shapes, including the squishircle, correctangle, and stopsignagon.
