SARATOGA, CA--Saying she could have predicted every single thing they discussed, area mother Andrea Hopkins confirmed on Wednesday that the negative parent-teacher conference she had for her third-grade son Nate was not exactly eye-opening. "Oh, so you're saying he's fidgety and doesn't get along well with others?--yeah, not exactly the shocker of the century," said Hopkins, adding that she wasn't really knocked out by the revelation that her 8-year-old was distractible, either. "I mean, I'm not sure I needed to drive all the way down here for the shocking news that the person that I fight with every single night about doing his homework is getting poor grades." Reached for comment, the boy's father said he "learned a ton" and was sorry he missed the first half of the meeting.
