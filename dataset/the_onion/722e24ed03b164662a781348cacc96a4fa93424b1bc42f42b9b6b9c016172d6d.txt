SAN ANTONIO--After a slow start last Thursday in which they were upset in the first round by 13-seed Morehead State, the Louisville Cardinals have come roaring back in the NCAA Tournament, putting together several dominating performances and advancing to the Elite Eight. "Our guys didn't expect to lose that early, but if anything, that woke us up and made us realize how bad we really want this thing," said head coach Rick Pitino, adding that he was proud of his players for never giving up. "We're right back in it. And though we can't afford to lose too many more games, I've told our players that if we just concentrate on winning out, we can bring a title back to Louisville." In order to advance to the Final Four, the Cardinals will have to defeat a very strong Pitt team, who many analysts have dubbed the "Comeback Kids" for the way in which they rebounded from their early-round loss to Butler.
