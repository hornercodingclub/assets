NEW YORK--With blood dripping from her gritted teeth as she dragged the dead animal behind her, Suri Cruise reportedly deposited a mangled dog carcass on her mother's doorstep Thursday and plaintively asked, "Suri get meat now?" "Suri share with Mommy, make present," the 7-year-old said to her stunned mother, Katie Holmes, after lifting up the dead dog by the fur of its head and presenting it to her. "Suri hungers. Meat fresh. We feast now?" Reports indicate that a visibly emotional Holmes then tearfully gathered the child in her arms, brought her inside, and secured her back inside her cage.
