NEW YORK--Unable to sleep after a stressful day, Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez reportedly spent several hours last night lying in bed imagining how his life might have turned out if he hadn't played professional football, sources confirmed Wednesday. "My life would be great if I weren't a quarterback in the NFL," the 26-year-old reportedly thought to himself, growing melancholy as he envisioned living in a nice little town surrounded by people who genuinely liked him. "I'd have a normal job and a boss I respect. I could make a mistake and only the people in the room would know about it. Strangers wouldn't just shout at me on the street. Maybe I'd have a wife and a kid who would look up to me and be proud of me. Just to have one person in the world who believes I'm a hero--I think that would be enough." According to sources, the last image in Sanchez's mind before he fell asleep was of his imaginary family sitting side-by-side on the couch and rooting for Jets quarterback Geno Smith on the television.
