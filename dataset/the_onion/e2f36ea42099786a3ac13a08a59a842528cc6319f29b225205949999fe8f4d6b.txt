A dress that was worn by actress Lupita Nyong'o at the Academy Awards and later stolen from her hotel room, rumored to be made of 6,000 pearls and worth $150,000, was revealed to be a knockoff after the thieves took two of the pearls to be appraised and found them to be fake. What do think? "You just can't trust the people you rob these days." Elmer Hartman * Hearse Reseller "I was hoping the dress was real so I could feel disgusted with the entertainment industry's wealth, but feeling smug about Hollywood's phoniness is okay too." Crystal Yerby * Guidance Counselor "This really calls into question the integrity of red carpet reporting." Earl Branco * Systems Analyst
