LOS ANGELES--In a concentrated effort to ensure the movie set felt like a safe, supportive place for all those involved, sources confirmed Wednesday that a female director was asked if she felt comfortable filming a scene while nude. "I just wanted to do a quick check with you to make sure you're comfortable with this," said producer Neil Forester, adding that the scene could be shot behind closed doors if prying eyes made her feel uncomfortable and even suggesting some shots could be completed using a stand-in director. "We'll just need you to disrobe for a moment so you can get the shot the way it deserves to be filmed. Don't worry, it's going to be very tasteful--we really think this is what this scene needs." At press time, the uneasy director had been presented with a moleskin nude unitard to put on before starting to film the scene.
