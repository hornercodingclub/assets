BELMONT, MA--Escalating over the course of 20 minutes from a restrained discussion with a coworker to a heated confrontation between multiple members of his management team, the fantasized argument currently taking place in the mind of Digital Ventures, Inc. employee Jesse Newman is getting pretty intense, sources confirmed today. "You're talking to about incompetence? ?" Newman said in his mind while furrowing his brow and letting the entirely fictitious dispute go to an increasingly frank and emotionally charged place. "Mark, no one in this room agrees with you. Why? Because they don't you. And they never have. And if you honestly believe that what you do around here is in any way vital, or important, or irreplaceable, then you are out of your mind. Absolutely out of your mind. No... made it personal by insinuating that I wasn't up to the task." At press time, a blood vessel was just becoming visible on Newman's temple.
