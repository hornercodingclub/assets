FOXBOROUGH, MA--In a shocking reversal of behavior, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick reportedly adopted a half-dozen dogs from a local humane society Friday, saving the canines from euthanasia. "I just love these pooches," said Belichick, smiling and chuckling as the six dogs licked at his face. "They're so cute. I like to play with them in my backyard." At press time, Belichick was reportedly promising each of the dogs a "very special treat." UPDATE:
