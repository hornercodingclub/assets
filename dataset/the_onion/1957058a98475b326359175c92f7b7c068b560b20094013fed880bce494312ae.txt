OWINGS MILLS, MD--After losing tight-end Dennis Pitta to a season-ending injury,  the Baltimore Ravens' offense suffered another major blow Monday as team sources confirmed that quarterback Joe Flacco had lined up under center. "I saw Joe calling signals and stepping up to the line and--well, obviously your stomach just kinda drops when you see something like that," said head coach John Harbaugh, who acknowledged that the team now has a "major void" to fill at quarterback. "Of course we'll try to find a way to recover from what happened today, but right now I know the whole team is feeling completely demoralized." The team reportedly sustained yet another crippling setback when Joe Flacco received the snap.
