NEW YORK--Slowly making their way out to midfield with the assistance of their owners, surviving members of the first Puppy Bowl championship team were honored at Animal Planet Stadium during Sunday's Kitty Half-Time Show. "Tonight, we are proud to recognize the accomplishments of these iconic legends whose exceptional playfulness on the sport's cutest stage paved the way for future generations of puppy players," announcer Dan Schachner said before introducing the aging title-winners--several of whom are now blind or whose hind legs are supported by a wheelchair--and giving each dog a commemorative Puppy Bowl I chew toy. "Of course, no one will ever forget 'The Fetch'--the defining moment of that first Puppy Bowl and arguably the most adorable play in puppy football history--when Cocoa sniffed out an opposing wagging-tailback in the barkfield, retrieved the plush ball, and took it all the way to the dog house. It is one of the greatest-ever touchdown frolics." The halftime ceremony reportedly concluded with a special segment in memory of Jack Russell terrier Max, Puppy Bowl I's Most Valuable Puppy, who was sadly put down in 2015 after battling heartworm for several years.
