Ed Gillespie, a top adviser to Mitt Romney, admitted the campaign had thus far failed to provide enough details about policy proposals and said a concerted effort would be made to better communicate the Republican candidate's specific ideas and stances. What do think? "That's sad. When you take something like the Romney campaign and try to analyze it, quantify it, or pin it down--that's when you destroy its beauty."

Mitch Giordano * Plasma Physicist "Wait, so he hasn't shared the details of his policy proposals? So what have I been disagreeing with for the past three months?" Tommy Null * Pelt Scraper
