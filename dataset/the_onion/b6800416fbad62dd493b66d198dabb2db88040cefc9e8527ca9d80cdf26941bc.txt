NEW YORK--Adding the big-name dinosaur to an already stacked lineup featuring stars like Nathan Drake and Ratchet, Sony scored a big win for the upcoming PlayStation 5 Wednesday by poaching Yoshi away from Nintendo with a record-breaking 10-year, $400-million contract. "This is a huge day for Sony. Yoshi is one of the most talented and popular characters out there, and we are thrilled by his decision to join the Playstation family," said Sony Interactive and Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan, who revealed Yoshi was drawn to the world-class facilities at Sony's American headquarters in New York and is eager to start the next phase of his career, one where he didn't have to work in the shadow of Mario or Link. "Yoshi will bring incredible egg-throwing and platforming abilities to our roster. He has been an underappreciated leader at Nintendo for years, and we know fans want to see what he can do outside the confines of that system. We see huge potential in Yoshi both as a big-time superstar who could potentially carry his own open-world survival game as well as work with stars like Kratos in ." Ryan admitted that while he was thrilled by the signing, he hoped that Yoshi's famous clashes and feuding with Nintendo management were a thing of the past.
