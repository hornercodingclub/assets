PASADENA, CA--Exploding out of the three-point stance and driving the Auburn defender backwards, Florida State left guard Josue Matias reportedly opened up a massive hole in his frontal cortex Monday during the National Championship game. "Wow, he just slammed into the defensive lineman with such unbelievable force," commentator Brent Musburger said of the catastrophic collision that created a huge hole in the middle of the frontal lobe and sprang the Seminoles' ball carrier free for a three-yard gain. "He came barreling up the field and , just loosened the whole thing up. This is a BCS Championship memory that he'll always [scarcely] remember." Following the play, a dazed and disoriented Matias wandered back 15 yards after a teammate was penalized for clipping.
