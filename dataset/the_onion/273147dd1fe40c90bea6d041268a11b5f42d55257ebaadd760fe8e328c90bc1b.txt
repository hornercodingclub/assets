Clothing retailer PacSun received backlash over Memorial Day weekend after selling a T-shirt featuring a black-and-white image of an upside-down American flag, which angered veterans and shoppers who found it disrespectful. What do think? "The role of T-shirts has always been to push society's boundaries." Glenn Eades * Music Festival Vendor "Horrible. The American flag is only supposed to appear right-side up on someone's disgusting, sweaty tank top." John Bickerstaff * Unemployed "Aeropostale would never disrespect our veterans like this."
