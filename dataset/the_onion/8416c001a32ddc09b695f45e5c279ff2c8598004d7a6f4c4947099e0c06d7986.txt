BALTIMORE--In response to a number of disturbing incidents occurring in the area, civil rights organization NAACP issued a travel advisory Thursday warning black Americans to exercise extreme caution when visiting their own backyards. "We urge African Americans to be very careful and vigilant when venturing out onto your patios, decks, and even front porches," said NAACP president Derrick Johnson, recommending that visitors to their personal property remain empty-handed for the duration of their trip. "We strongly advise against running or making any sudden movements while you're in the yard behind your house. Additionally, please take a careful, methodical approach to mowing the lawn or hanging up laundry." At press time, a violent incident involving law enforcement necessitated an expansion of the travel warning into living rooms.
