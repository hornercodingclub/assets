DALLAS--Posing with his family in a 10-second promotional spot for the NFL that aired during Thursday's game between the Cowboys and Redskins, Dallas wide receiver Dez Bryant could be seen reproachfully smacking his son, Zayne Bryant, whom he noticed squirming around midway through the commercial. "Hi, I'm Dez Bryant. On this special day, our family would just like to wish you a--Zayne, cut it out," said Bryant, who then hit the back of his son's head in frustration, smiled and attempted to regain his composure during what the ad's director confirmed was the cleanest take he could get. "Anyway, Happy Thanksgiving, from our home to--stop crying, now." Sources confirmed that as soon as the camera cut away, Bryant began strangling his mother, Angela.
