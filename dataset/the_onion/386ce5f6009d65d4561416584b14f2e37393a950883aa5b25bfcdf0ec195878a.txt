A charity bookshop in Wales is imploring patrons not to donate Fifty Shades Of Grey after being inundated with hundreds of copies of the erotic novel, which they will ship to a warehouse to be sold online or recycled.

Ariana Souvenia * Sweepstakes Manager "I'm surprised so many people are giving them away. I feel like I learn something new each time I reread it." Chuck Wellesley * Appetizer Engineer
