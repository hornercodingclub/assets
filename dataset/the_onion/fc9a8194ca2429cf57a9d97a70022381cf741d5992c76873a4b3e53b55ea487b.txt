PHOENIX--With his Suns season over and a new team likely in the future for free agent Steve Nash, the Canadian point guard spent an emotional final day with his American host family, the Berkleys, Sunday. "Steve has been such a joy to have around, so polite and such a great role model for [our son] Ben," said Lisa Berkley, Nash's host mother, who Nash claimed makes the best mac and cheese he's ever tasted. "He struggled to adjust a bit at first--there were a lot of tears that first year--but eventually people stopped picking on him and he really became part of the family. I'm going to miss driving him to practice every morning." Nash, who will be returning to his home country for the summer, said he expects to find hosts in another city in time for next season, adding that he hopes his next family lets him stay up just as late playing Xbox 360 as the Berkleys did.
