Thirteen-year-old actress Millie Bobbie Brown has been stranded at a resort in Bali for 10 days after a volcano eruption grounded flights for thousands of travelers. The star reassured fans on Instagram that she is safe during her stay. What do think? "Thank God a famous child was in danger or I'd have no idea the people of Bali even had a volcano problem." David Waters * Choirman "These kid actors are always doing drugs or shoplifting or angering ancient volcano gods." Nell Ott * Autograph Forger "I stopped watching the show because of these kind of unrealistic scenes." Zachary Mulaney * Street Crossing Guar
