LOS ANGELES--Fearing that such a revelation might derail an otherwise promising relationship, actor Leonardo DiCaprio reported feeling nervous Tuesday about the inevitable moment when he would have to tell his new girlfriend that he is still a virgin. "I hope she doesn't look at me differently when she finds out I've never gone all the way before," said DiCaprio, 43, noting that while he has dated dozens of actresses and models--and once got to third base with Claire Danes on the set of 1996's --he hasn't ever "sealed the deal" with one of his sweethearts. "I really like this girl, and I don't want her to think I'm weird or anything, or that I've built up this whole 'sex' thing in my mind to the point where I'm going to have impossibly high expectations. The truth is, I've just been waiting for the right person to come along and don't want to do it until it feels right." Remarking that "good things come to those who wait," DiCaprio pointed to the example of his close friend Martin Scorsese, who lost his virginity only last year and said it was "pretty cool."
