DETROIT--Following reports today that a new tip has prompted a renewed FBI search for the body of Jimmy Hoffa, the U.S. populace admitted they are, and have pretty much always been, a little bored whenever the whole thing with the former Teamsters president comes up. "I'm sorry, why are we supposed to care about this, again?" asked St. Paul, MN resident Richard Lott, 36, echoing the thoughts of millions of Americans who say they have "no discernible interest" in the nearly 40-year-old case of the missing labor union leader and assume anyone who did have any interest in the subject "died a long time ago." "Every couple of years they're checking out a different parking lot for this guy's body--I don't get it. It doesn't seem like a big, fascinating mystery to me. So someone did a great job hiding a body. Good for them." The U.S. populace admitted it was still more than willing to hear any news whatsoever about the Zodiac Killer.
