MANCHESTER, CT--According to bored and increasingly irritated sources currently sitting at lane 8 of Manchester Family Bowl, Nick Morwood's fourteenth birthday party has now dragged on into a fifth excruciating hour. "Another game? You can't be serious," said Will Meaker, 12, noting with great annoyance that Morwood had just entered a set of new ridiculous nicknames into the computer. "And we haven't even done cake and gifts yet. Ugh, this is never going to end." At press time, a fed-up Meaker groaned as the party was extended further by an attendant who spent several minutes dislodging a pin with a broomstick.
