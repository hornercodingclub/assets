BROOKLYN, NY--Calling it a "disgusting habit," teammates and coaches finally asked Nets point guard Deron Williams to stop dribbling the ball with his mouth wide open, team sources confirmed Friday. "It's bad enough when he does it at home, but when we're all playing in somebody else's arena, it embarrasses us in front of the other team," said Nets forward Gerald Wallace, adding that on several occasions he's caught Williams drooling all over the ball while leading a fast break. "Not only is it gross, it's just rude. We're all trying to play basketball here. We don't need to see that. Did his mother or high school coaches not teach him anything?" While on the subject, several members of the organization also called attention to how many visiting teams as well as members of the media are beginning to notice that Brook Lopez never showers.
