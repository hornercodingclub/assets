Police in Romania uncovered $3.2 million in rare books and manuscripts including first editions of works by Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei hidden in a secret compartment underneath a house, which authorities believe were stolen in a London warehouse heist in 2017. What do think? "Still, for three years it was a really good hiding spot." Jacob Marcontel Glass Blower "That's a lot of trouble to go to for some old books considering the same info is probably on Wikipedia." Norman Young Embossing Technician "Wow, that sounds like something ripped straight from the plot of a much less valuable book." Paris Wroth * Ranch Hand
