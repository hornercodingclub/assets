Oxford Dictionaries has responded to anthropologist Michael Oman-Reagan after the latter argued their definition of "rabid" was sexist due to its use of the example phrase "rabid feminist," a term that Oxford has promised to revisit and potentially revise in their collection going forward. What do think? "That's too bad. Dictionaries were one of the last places where men were free to be men." Amos Aronson * Staple Bender "So should I get a shot if a feminist bites me or not?" Tammy Lefkin * Dumpling Wrapper "I guess now we can't even compare women to dogs without being labeled sexist." Todd Vail * Culinary Correspondent
