BRISTOL, CT--Meeting with his network of spies in a darkened, remote hallway at ESPN headquarters, NFL analyst Adam Schefter reportedly distributed sweet treats Friday to the street urchins returning from the league's various front offices with whispers of the latest free agency rumors. "Gather round, my little scouts, for those with tidings of Adrian Peterson's likely landing spot shall find themselves the owner of two peppermint drops and a sugarplum," said Schefter to the barefoot, soot-covered band of crafty young beggars, shoe-shines, and pickpockets he has relied on for years to be his eyes and ears around the NFL. "There's also a nice tin of bonbons for whoever can tell me the terms of Matt Cassel's new contract with the Titans. Now, my dearest Timothy, what have you heard of the Browns' plans to address their quarterback situation?" According to sources, Schefter was unable to confirm whether Roger Goodell would alter celebration penalties after learning the orphan dispatched to find out had been captured and locked in the commissioner's office cupboard.
