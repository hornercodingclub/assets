In the seventh and final round of the 2014 NFL Draft this weekend, Missouri defensive end Michael Sam was selected by the St. Louis Rams as the 249th overall pick, becoming the first openly gay player to join the NFL. What do think? "Why can't this guy bottle up his sexual preference and channel it into explosive rage and violence like other players?" Josh Hall * Systems Analyst "It's nice to see the NFL take a step forward on its single biggest issue besides sexual assault, racist team names, and concussion-induced suicides." Rebecca Keener * Day Care Administrator "I find it strange that a player's sexuality would be a subject of discussion. Are you sure this is professional sports we're talking about?" Oliver Peet * Bus Route Coordinator
