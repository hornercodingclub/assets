BOURBONNAIS, IL--Despite struggling through the first three weeks of training camp, Bears offensive line coach Mike Tice told a group of reporters Tuesday he has "just about figured out" the difference between offensive tackles and guards. "I can't say with confidence right now I know which is which, but that's why we hold training camp," said Tice, who has tried to label the line formation on his fingers to help him remember but keeps sucking the ink off while thinking about other things. "You work on this stuff now so you don't have to worry about it during the season." Though Tice speculated he could learn the difference between the types of players by the beginning of the regular season, he admitted that he continues to struggle with the difference between "left" and "right."
