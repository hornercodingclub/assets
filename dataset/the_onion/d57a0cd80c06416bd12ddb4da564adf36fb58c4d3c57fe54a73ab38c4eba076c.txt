In 2008, two Democratic governors, Eliot Spitzer of New York and Rod Blagojevich of Illinois, were disgraced by illegal activities. What do think? "We should just be grateful that all of this happened at a state level. Can you imagine if one of our presidents had conducted himself in a disgraceful or illegal way?" Tammy Hall * Provost "Those crazy-ass governors. Thank God all those lieutenant governors are around to pick up the slack." Phil Kuenn * Systems Analyst "Oh, sure, pick on the Democratic governors. What about all those people Arnold Schwarzenegger mercilessly mowed down before being crushed by a hydraulic press?" Emerson Rocchi * Police Officer
