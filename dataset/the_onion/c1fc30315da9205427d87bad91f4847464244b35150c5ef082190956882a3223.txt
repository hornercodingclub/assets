WASHINGTON--Saying the measure was necessary to improve public safety, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday afternoon that it intends to deploy thousands of additional smartphone-carrying bystanders to the nation's streets. "We believe increasing the presence of eyewitnesses with smartphones in our neighborhoods will go a long way toward ensuring justice is being served in our communities," said Attorney General Eric Holder, adding that while the department intends to strategically place onlookers on street corners, in parks, and around other public spaces throughout the country, high-risk urban neighborhoods would likely receive the greatest surge in passersby ready to document any misconduct. "It has become increasingly clear that the current force of camera-wielding pedestrians is too small to properly serve our citizens, with many infractions simply going unfilmed. However, this new approach will allow citizens to go about their days, knowing that someone will always be nearby to record offenses carried out against them and eventually hold the perpetrators accountable." Holder then reminded Americans to be thankful for the service provided by the nation's ranks of bystanders, saying that, in much of the country, the individuals holding up digital recording devices are the only ones maintaining the line between order and chaos.
