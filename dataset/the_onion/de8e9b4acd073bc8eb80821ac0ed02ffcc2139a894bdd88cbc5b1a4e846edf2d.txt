DURHAM, NC--According to a study published Monday by researchers at Duke University's Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, humans experience the most intense feelings of happiness when pressing the "skip ad" button before watching a video on the internet. "After measuring test subjects' endorphin and serotonin levels during a variety of pleasurable activities, we found that the largest spikes in joy were recorded when participants stopped an online advertisement and initiated the video they actually wanted to watch," said the study's lead author, Dr. Paul Alleslev, who noted that feelings of bliss began rising as the timer indicating how soon the button would appear counted down toward zero. "Also, using fMRI scans, we noticed that once the 'skip ad' box became visible, the pleasure centers of the brain lit up with a flurry of activity, as did the motor cortex, prompting subjects to click the button with extraordinary speed as soon as it appeared onscreen." Alleslev added, however, that humans appeared to experience the most acute feelings of rage after they'd watched enough videos that the "skip ad" option was no longer available.
