THE REALM OF MISDOING--Cackling with glee while observing the turmoil brought about by his consternating ways, enchanted goblin Grumblethor the Mischievous--creator of the world's chaos and confusion--revealed Wednesday that he is pleased with the mayhem his magical antics have wrought upon White House-FBI relations. "Look at the halfwits in Washington as they fall under my bewitching spell, sniping at each other like the hapless fools they are--Oh, it has all been so devilishly simple!" said the Lord of Mischief and Mayhem, peering into his smoke-filled Globe of Deceit with visible delight as resentful tweets appeared from Andrew McCabe, Donald Trump, John O. Brennan, and James Comey, among others. "Soon, I will befuddle the dunces in the Supreme Court into posting Facebook statuses about their anger toward Congress, and so Grumblethor's diabolical plans will come to fruition! Fye-dee-dee, dum-dee-dee, another triumph for rascally me!" At press time, Grumblethor was seen cantering in joy through his Cavern of Disorder after a minion brought word that millions of Americans believed that a "deep state" in the government pulled levers behind the scenes.
