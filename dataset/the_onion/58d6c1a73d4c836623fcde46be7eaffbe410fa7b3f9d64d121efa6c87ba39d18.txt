STOCKTON, CA--While purchasing a single ticket to see a Monday afternoon screening of the Will Smith film , poor son of a bitch Evan Whitfield, 38, was reportedly forced to take a load of shit from a theater employee for wanting to see the commercially unsuccessful science-fiction movie. "Wow, you're actually willing to put yourself through this--you know it's not too late to change your mind, right?" said the 19-year-old ticket clerk, who reportedly had to act like an asshole about it rather than just hand Whitfield his ticket and let him watch a movie. "You know, I better go make sure they actually fire up the projector this time--I think they've taken the last few days off. Good luck finding a seat in there, buddy!" At press time, Whitfield was sitting alone in the movie theater while being mercilessly mocked by the employee sweeping the floors.
