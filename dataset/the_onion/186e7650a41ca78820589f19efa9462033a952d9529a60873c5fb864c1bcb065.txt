WASHINGTON--Providing a friendly playmate for their dog Bo, White House sources confirmed today that President Barack Obama and his family have adopted an energetic, 44-year-old Portuguese Water Man. "I'm happy to report that the Obamas have welcomed the arrival of the newest member of their family: a beautiful, soaking wet Portuguese Water Man," said White House spokesperson Hannah August, referring to the shaggy, perpetually drenched Lisbon native, who at press time was napping on the floor of the Grand Foyer. "He's only just arrived, but he's already made himself at home. He spends hours every day running around the North Lawn, and he loves to curl up in the First Couple's bed at night. Portuguese Water Men are, by nature, very affectionate, so he's already made lots of friends around here, the cute little guy." August confirmed that the Obamas have decided to name their new furry friend Ernesto Guiomar Aristedes.
