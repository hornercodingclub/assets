LAS VEGAS--Perplexed and disoriented as he accompanied WBO light heavyweight champion Sergey "Krusher" Kovalev to the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena Saturday, local man Derek Hoff confirmed to reporters that he has absolutely no idea how he wound up in the boxer's entourage. "I was just sort of walking around outside the casino, and the next thing I know I'm caught up in a big swarm of guys heading down to the ring," said the 43-year-old claims adjuster, adding that amid the flurry of lights and blaring music inside the arena, he was somehow outfitted in a sponsor's T-shirt and then found himself holding a title belt over his head while walking behind Kovalev. "Two minutes later, I'm holding down the ropes with my foot while he climbs into the ring. I didn't really know what was happening, so I kind of just stood quietly in his corner until everyone else went to go sit ringside." According to sources, Hoff was equally confused immediately after the fight when he was given a handgun and guided into the back of a limousine bound for a nearby strip club.
