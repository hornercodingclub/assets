WASHINGTON--Entering through a side door and bidding the assembled legislators, congressional aides, and members of the media to give him a moment with the former FBI director, President Donald Trump reportedly asked the entire Senate to clear the chamber during James Comey's testimony Thursday so he could speak to him alone. "Folks, do you mind giving me just a second with this guy?" said Trump, ushering the gathered lawmakers out of the room as a visibly uncomfortable Comey silently looked on from his seat. "You too, Susan [Collins (R-ME)] and Mark [Warner (D-VA)]. This should only take a minute. Thanks." At press time, after the last of the senators had finished filing quietly out of the chamber, the president was seen closing the door behind them.
