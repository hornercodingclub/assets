ATLANTA--Sources from within the Atlanta Thrashers organization indicated Thursday that the team currently ranks 11th in the Eastern Conference standings with a record of 27-28-11. "The 27 wins are largely due to [the team's] 15th best goals per game average," said the Thrashers source, adding that the teams' ranking 9th in power play percentage was also a factor. "But the 28 losses are likely the results of allowing 3.25 goals per game." When pressed with further questioning, sources confirmed that defenseman Tobias Enstrom leads the team with 40 assists.
