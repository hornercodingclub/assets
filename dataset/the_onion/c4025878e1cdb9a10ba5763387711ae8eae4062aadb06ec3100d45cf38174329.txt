NEW ORLEANS--After completing the final game of his career Sunday, Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis was openly crying on national television over what a humiliating spectacle he's become. "God, look at me! Look at all these people crawling over one another to get a shot of me weeping like this," a blubbering Lewis told reporters. "And to think grown men back home might be getting emotional about all this, too. Oh jeez, this is just the worst. I'm the worst." Stay tuned for more updates as the embarrassing and shameful spectacle that Lewis has become carries over into the locker room, the postgame press conference, and the majority of the next week.
