Matt Ireland * Decal Designer "If that baby wants to wear an American flag, she has to wait until she's grown up and can buy an American flag bikini like the rest of us." Lauryn Lewis * Liberal Arts Advocate "Don't blame it all on the photographer. That baby was loving it in there." Nick Feitel * Unemployed
