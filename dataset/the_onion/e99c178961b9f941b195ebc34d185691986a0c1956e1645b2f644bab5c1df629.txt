LOS ANGELES--In light of numerous allegations of sexual harassment made against producer Harvey Weinstein and other powerful film industry figures, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released Friday a complete list of feature films that can be enjoyed without supporting a sexual predator. "Sexual harassment is a systemic issue in Hollywood, and we understand that many fans don't want to support any movies made by its perpetrators, which is why we've taken it upon ourselves to compile a list of all 14 movies that viewers can feel comfortable watching without being complicit," Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said of the list of films, which includes , , and , that are completely free of influence by any producer, director, actor, or crew member who had sexually harassed someone. "Fans who want to avoid watching any film featuring the contributions of a sexually abusive distributor, screenwriter, location scout, supporting actor, or key grip are assured they can safely enjoy these dozen-plus movies. From --the only film from before 1970 to qualify--to , there's something for every moviegoer who wants to take a stand and refuse to support work by sexual predators." At press time, the Academy had apologized and removed several films from the list after new sexual harassment allegations had emerged.
