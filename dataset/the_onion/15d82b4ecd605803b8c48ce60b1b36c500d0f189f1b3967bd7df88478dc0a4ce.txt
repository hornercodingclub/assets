--In a sudden departure from their long-held stance of not being here to play games and not, in fact, having the time to play games, the nation's hardass cops announced Wednesday they had finally carved out a couple hours during which games could be played. "Do you think you're some sort of funny guy? Do you think you can mess with me? Well, now is the time to do that," said veteran Bronx detective Roger "Ratchet" O'Doyle, adding that it was the perfect time to mess with him and that, for the moment, lowlife scum could also assume he was born yesterday without fear of being shoved into a wall or dangled from a rooftop. "We've got about two hours here to get jerked around by punks like you. After that, it will no longer be a game, but for now, we do indeed have time for this shit." The period in which hardass cops can be fucked with will reportedly continue until former detective Darryl Sykes emerges from retirement, grabs a low-level drug dealer by the shirt, shouts "Playtime's over!" and tosses him off a bridge.
