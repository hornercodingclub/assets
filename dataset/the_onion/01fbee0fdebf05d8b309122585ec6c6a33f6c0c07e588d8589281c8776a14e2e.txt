LOS ANGELES--Saying that "it's time," a visibly weary Harrison Ford pleaded with his agents Thursday to simply stop this and let him die, sources confirmed. "Please, you've had your fill. Just let me go quietly into the night," the 71-year-old star reportedly said, later imploring his agents not to hand him any more scripts and to just "let [him] go to sleep forever." "I've spent my entire life doing this for you people. We had a good run, but it's been a long journey and I'm very tired now. Please don't talk about any more projects or how the director will work around my schedule. And don't try to convince me that this is how I get my Oscar. It's over. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up." Reports confirm that Ford's agents then mentioned a new script set during the Cold War in which he'd play Robert McNamara, which prompted Ford to sigh, shake his head, and say, "Okay, let me take a look."
