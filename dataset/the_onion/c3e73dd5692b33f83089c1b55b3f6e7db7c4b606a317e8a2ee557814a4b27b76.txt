FONTANA, CA--Following a collision on the final lap at the Auto Club 400 last weekend, NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin has done busted his ol' spine bone, racing team medical staff confirmed Wednesday. "Denny came bouncin' off that inside wall hotter'n a goat's ass in a pepper patch an' got his spine bone smashed up sump'n awful," said team physician Logan McRae of Hamlin, who after plumb near snapping his standin' pole in two reportedly was done taken away in a big whirly-plane to a local hospital, where the fancy learnin' doctors figured his broke-up back axle was as useless as tits on a bull. "It's a powerful fracture, but we're fixin' to slap some spit on't and have our boy patched up lickety-split. He oughter be perambulatin' di-rectly, I reckon." Dr. McRae added that though Hamlin will eventually regain the mobility needed to resume his racing career, he may require the use of a steppin' stick for the rest of his days.
