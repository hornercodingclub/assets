Breaking into the California State Mining and Mineral Museum on Friday, thieves armed with pickaxes made off with $2 million worth of gold and jewels, but failed to crack a safe containing a famous 14-pound hunk of gold known as the Fricot Nugget. What do think? "Thank goodness. My kids really have their hearts set on seeing that Fricot Nugget." Kareem Johnson * Ship Boss "It'll be easy to find them. All police need to do is watch for any new mineral museums that pop up suspiciously fast." Carla Kleinberg * Unemployed "Wish I'd got the alert earlier--I saw two guys with pickaxes and sacks of gold at Del Taco but didn't think anything of it at the time." David Sands * Broom Maker
