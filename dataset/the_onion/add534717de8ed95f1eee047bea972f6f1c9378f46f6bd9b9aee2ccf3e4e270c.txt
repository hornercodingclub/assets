INDIANAPOLIS--Responding to critics who claim that recent games demonstrate that Indianapolis is a one-dimensional pass-first team with a porous run defense, quarterback Peyton Manning leapt to his team's defense Monday by saying that he, Peyton Manning, won or lost Colts football games as a team. "Everything I do out there, every play, every first down, every touchdown pass, I do as a team," said Manning, who added he resented the implication that he was weak in the short-yardage running game and could not pick up the blitz. "Need I remind you that I've converted 68 percent of my second-half third-down chances this year, that I have the lowest team average in dropped passes, and that I'm still undefeated? I think I'm doing pretty good for the so-called 'worst Colts team in years,' don't you?" When asked about placekicker Adam Vinatieri's last-minute game-wnning field goal against Denver last Sunday, a confused Manning said he "wished Vinatieri continued good luck with the Patriots."
