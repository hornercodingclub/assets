NEW YORK--Following reports earlier this week of pop star Taylor Swift's whirlwind romance with One Direction singer Harry Styles, sources confirmed today that Swift has moved on and is apparently now dating creator Jim Davis. "Taylor and Jim were first spotted canoodling in a SoHo bar last night, and we were able to confirm today that the two are indeed an item," Gawker contributor Janice Reynolds wrote of the relationship between the nearly 23-year-old singer-songwriter and the 67-year-old syndicated cartoonist, nicknaming the couple "Tayvis." "Just this morning, fans took several photos of the lovebirds leaving her Tribeca hotel hand in hand. They're actually really cute together." At press time, sources reported seeing the new couple board a private jet that was most likely bound for Davis' home in Albany, IN.
