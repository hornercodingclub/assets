In a surveillance video of assailant George Zimmerman from the night of the Trayvon Martin shooting, Zimmerman does not appear to be bloody or injured, raising questions about his story of being attacked and beaten by Martin. What do think? "Perhaps the Sanford police should consider switching to the Canon Legria HF G10, which shoots 1920 by 1080 high-def video with an optional 25p frame rate for a truly cinematic look." Darby Villechaize * Home Attendant "Okay, fine. Let's assume Trayvon Martin didn't attack George Zimmerman. Does that make him any less black?" Chuck Tyrrell * Sanitarian "A new clue! This horrific tragedy keeps getting better and better!" Peggy Lindley * Unemployed
