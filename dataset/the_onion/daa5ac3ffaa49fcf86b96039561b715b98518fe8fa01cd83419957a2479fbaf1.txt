YOUNGSTOWN, OH--Despite the release of a new documentary exposing the disturbing practices and adverse health effects associated with the fast food industry, impoverished single mother of three Karen Ford told reporters Thursday that the revelations in the shocking new film haven't exactly "flipped [her] world upside down." "Look, I'm working two minimum-wage jobs just to keep my kids fed and clothed, so I can't say I'm quite ready to throw the playbook out the window just because the cheapest and only locally convenient source of food happens to contain some GMOs and trans fats," Ford told reporters, noting that the film's advocacy of cooking most meals at home from fresh produce and sustainably raised meats hasn't really changed the fact that her take-home pay is just under $400 a week. "Hey, I'd love for my children to be eating perfect five-dollar florets of broccoli and fresh-caught fish from a fancy organic grocer, but the closest one of those stores is four towns away and, after paying for a roof over my kids' heads and keeping the water flowing in our home, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that our food budget might not be quite big enough to feed seven nights a week, let alone three growing kids. So I can't say these hard new truths about fast food have really been a deal-breaker for my family's dietary habits." Ford added that she would definitely sit right down and intently watch the full documentary the minute she had a few hours free from her 75-hour workweek and around-the-clock parenting duties.
