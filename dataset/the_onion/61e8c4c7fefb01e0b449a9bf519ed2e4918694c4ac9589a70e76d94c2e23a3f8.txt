A New York real estate firm is buying the iconic Chrysler Building for $150 million, a sum that is nearly 81 percent less than what it was purchased for in 2008 due to the unique challenges of operating an aging building.

Greg Whyte * Party Bus Driver "Wow, I really dodged a bullet by not buying the Chrysler Building in 2008." Aliesha Castro * Zoo Vivesectionist
