ENCINITAS, CA--Intently scanning the room for signs of fatigue or excessive perspiration, local gym member Brian O'Grady reportedly kept a tally Monday of how many people were in worse shape than him. "That guy's been on the seated bike for like a minute and he's already out of breath, and that old dude's doing like 30 pounds on the shoulder press machine--so, yeah, that's two," O'Grady thought to himself, leaping suddenly into double digits as he counted 15 people limply moving their arms and legs in a Zumba class. "And I bet I could easily outlast four of these people on the ellipticals, plus two, maybe three on the treadmills--oh, and definitely the guy who's been on the rower two minutes and could have a heart attack any time now." At press time, O'Grady had determined that a muscular woman doing numerous weighted pull-ups was a professional athlete of some sort and would not count against him.
