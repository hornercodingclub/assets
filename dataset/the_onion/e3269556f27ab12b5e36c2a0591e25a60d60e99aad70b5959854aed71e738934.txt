MINNEAPOLIS--Removing any filled trash bags from their receptacles and sweeping along the empty concourse, members of the Target Center custodial staff reportedly began cleaning up midway through the third quarter of Monday night's game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and New Orleans Pelicans in hopes of leaving right at the final buzzer. "I like to get a head start a few minutes into the second half, when most of the aisles are clear and you don't have to worry too much about blocking anyone's view," said facilities manager Frank Kulich, adding that the janitorial team only gives the arena's upper deck a quick once-over at halftime since it usually remains completely untouched during games. "If we stay on top of things in the first half, there are just a couple spots in the first few rows that need to be mopped up before we can clock out and go home. Technically, we're not supposed to leave before the end of the game--even if all our work is done--but at that point any traffic in the parking lot is long gone, so it's not too bad." At press time, Kulich was quickly wiping down the Timberwolves' bench, which had emptied out as the play clock wound down the final two minutes of the fourth quarter.
