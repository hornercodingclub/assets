This past weekend, Mitt Romney vowed that he would look at what President Obama has done regarding Israel and "do the opposite." What do think? "I can only assume what Romney means is that he's going to cut off aid to Israel, support the Palestinians, and make out with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad." Lucas Friel * Tape Cutter "If applied uniformly across the board, this style of rhetoric could really take the guesswork out of Romney's positions on everything." Beth Altman * Systems Analyst "Okay, so he's got his foreign policy down, but what about the economy? Has he mentioned whether he'll make it better or did he say he would make it worse? The answer is important." Ray Creaghead * Bead Builder
