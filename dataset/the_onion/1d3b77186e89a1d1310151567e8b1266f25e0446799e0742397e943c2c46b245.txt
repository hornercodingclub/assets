BURBANK, CA--Not having appeared together publicly since they said goodbye to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. back in January, the Obamas reunited for a live hour-long TBS primetime event Friday for the first time since leaving the White House. "Now, Barack, what if I told you that backstage I had some very familiar faces that you haven't seen in some time--c'mon, let's bring them on out!" said host Mario Lopez, as Michelle, Sasha, and Malia Obama stepped onto the set and waved to the live studio audience before walking over to the couch and taking turns politely hugging each other. "We're so lucky to have everyone back together again! But before we get into what you've all been up to since the presidency ended, let's take a look back at some of our favorite moments from the eight unforgettable years you welcomed America into your home." At press time, the camera cut to dogs Bo and Sunny sitting in the audience after Lopez asked, "Hey, wait a second, aren't we missing some folks?"
