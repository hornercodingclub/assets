WASHINGTON--While declaring that the musical instrument was by no means ideally suited to the task, a report released by the National Endowment for the Arts Thursday concluded that the saxophone nevertheless remains a fairly decent vehicle for expressing one's unique personality and subjective emotional experience. "Although there are certainly better ways to convey one's feelings artistically, saxophones aren't all that bad if there's nothing else around," read the 83-page report in part, which affirmed that, in terms of achieving emotional resonance, the reed instrument was "okay, all in all." "It's no piano or guitar or anything, but still, if you have something to get off your chest and there's a sax nearby, you could do worse." The report went on to remind readers that the tuba and Irish stepdancing are never an acceptable form of self-expression at any time or for any reason.
