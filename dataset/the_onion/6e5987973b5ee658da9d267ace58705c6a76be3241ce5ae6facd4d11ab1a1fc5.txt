MIAMI--According to his teammates and coaches, Colts quarterback Peyton Manning has been sequestered in the film room at Sun Life Stadium for the last three days reviewing game tape from the Saints' 1974 season. "Can't be too prepared," a bleary-eyed Manning reportedly told a team manager, adding that if the Saints decide to sign former middle linebacker Joe Federspiel, 60, before the game this Sunday, he'll know exactly what adjustments to make. "Could you get me that Rams game from November? I need to see how quick [former strong safety] Johnny Fuller got to the quarterback on the blitz. Go now." Manning later told the Colts defense that they didn't need to watch any of the game film, as the Saints' quarterback in 1974 was "absolutely terrible."
