Bruce Springsteen canceled his tour date in North Carolina last night to protest the passage of the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, a law that restricts transgender citizens' access to public restrooms. What do think? "I wish he'd stop being so political and just stick to singing 'Born In The U.S.A'!" Joey Newcomb * Systems Analyst "If North Carolina can't be swayed by an appeal to basic human empathy, hopefully they'll respond to the threat of not hearing 'Badlands' live." Marion Villander * Merchandise Critic "What's important here is that North Carolina's policies remain undisclosed to Def Leppard, REO Speedwagon, and Tesla until May 13."
