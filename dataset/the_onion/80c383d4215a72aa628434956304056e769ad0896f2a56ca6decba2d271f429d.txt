Surprised? I'm not. This is basically what I've been saying all along: that the Packers would use an opportunistic defense and a stalwart passing effort from Aaron Rodgers to defeat the Steelers.  That's what I said would happen and that's what did happen. I have to say, it was pretty obvious to anyone who even halfway paid attention. Now a lot of people are going to say that I spoke in broad platitudes like "this game is going to come down to whomever wants it more" and "whichever team moves the ball more effectively is going to win this game". But here's the flaw in that thinking: that's exactly what happened! The team that wanted it more won and the team that moved the ball more effectively won. I believe I said something about limiting turnovers, and no, the Packers didn't do that. But what does that matter? They won. Thus, everything I said came true. I hope that World Cup octopus is cursing me from heaven, because there's a new octopus in town. Mark Shepard. Be sure to check out the Dome Tuesday night 10:30/9:30 Central on Comedy Central.
