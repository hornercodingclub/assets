CAMBRIDGE, MA--A team of considerate, emotionally available researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced Monday the results of a study indicating that in a random sampling of five women, not even one has any idea how beautiful she actually is. "In clinical trials, we discovered 100 percent of test subjects were virtually oblivious to the fact that they are and always have been thoughtful, intelligent, and truly gorgeous, inside and out," sensitive scientist Sidney Kaplan said of the four-year, $30 million study aimed at showing women what they just can't seem to see for themselves. "Perhaps even more alarming, we found that 87 percent of women felt it was their job to try to make themselves into someone they aren't, instead of looking in the mirror and rejoicing at what they had already become. And trust me, what they had already become is perfect." The receptive and caring  authors of the study said their work would be published in the forthcoming issue of and available to women "anytime they need to hear it."
