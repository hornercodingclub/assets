MIAMI--Shooting 56 percent from the field so far this season and completing an astounding 49 of his last 65 shots, LeBron James has recently taken his game to another level in a transparent and paltry attempt to win widespread admiration, sources confirmed Tuesday. "In typical fashion, LeBron is shamelessly trying to get everyone to like him," said ESPN's Stephen A. Smith, who mentioned that it was "pitiful" to see James pulling publicity stunts such as improving his rebounding skills and shooting more consistently than any basketball player in history. "It's sad enough to see him scoring points at will, but when he's also locking down on defense, making all his teammates look better, and generally improving every facet of his game, it just looks desperate." Smith added that at least James had toned back his pathetic antics since last season, when the 9-time all star "practically begged" for praise by winning an NBA championship.
