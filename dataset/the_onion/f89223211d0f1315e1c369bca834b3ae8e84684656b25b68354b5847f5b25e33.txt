Annual traveling punk rock music festival Vans Warped Tour, which helped jump-start the careers of artists like Blink-182, Fall Out Boy, and Katy Perry, will end in 2018 after nearly 25 years. What do think? "Damn, Vans was always my favorite sneaker-based music festival." Henrietta Burns * Gold Teeth Appraiser "It was pretty obvious this would be the last year. Then again, I've been saying that since 2002." Nat Bryant * Feather Bed Beater "Nothing's more punk than working out the math, seeing the writing on the wall, and rationalizing that you had a good run." Paul Goldstein * Garlic Monger
