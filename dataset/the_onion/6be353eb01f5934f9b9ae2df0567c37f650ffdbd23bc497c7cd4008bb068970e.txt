Former Arizona representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in 2011, delivered the opening remarks yesterday at a congressional hearing on gun violence that later featured testimony from NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre. What do think? "Come on. If everyone who got shot felt the need to speak to Congress about gun control, we'd never hear the end of it." Janet Mooney * Unemployed "Think of the courage, strength, and determination it took to come back and address the nation like LaPierre did after these shootings." Larry Campisi * Block Maker "Until I hear the side of a deranged mass shooter I don't know what to think." Alonzo Marshall * Herbarium Curator
