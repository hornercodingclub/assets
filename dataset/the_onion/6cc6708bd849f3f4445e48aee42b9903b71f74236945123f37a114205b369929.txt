TALLAHASSEE, FL--Following weekend reports that teen pop sensation Justin Bieber visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, local Bieber fan Khloe McNeal, 13, announced Monday that she was 'jealous' of the 15-year-old Holocaust victim. "Biebs went to her ? So unfair," said the diehard 'Belieber' of the persecuted Jewish teen who, after hiding from the Nazis for two years in a cramped attic, died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp just weeks before its liberation. "What makes her so special that she gets a shout out? I retweet him every day and he mentions her by name and calls a 'great girl?' ." McNeal went on to say that she was so envious of Frank that she wanted to "literally die," adding that "some girls just have all the luck."
