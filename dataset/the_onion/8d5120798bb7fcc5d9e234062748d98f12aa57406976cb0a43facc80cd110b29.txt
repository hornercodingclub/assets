SECAUCUS, NJ--Honoring the individuals who they claim meant more to baseball this year than anyone, the MLB announced during Thursday's ceremony that the 2019 MVP would be awarded to the league's hardworking stadium concession staffers. "The Baseball Writers Association of America is pleased to give this year's Most Valuable Player award for both the American and National Leagues to the diligent men and women behind the counter," said BWAA president Rob Biertempfel, praising the world-class performance and dedication of all 50,000 food handlers, cashiers, and stadium barkers currently employed by every major baseball stadium in America. "You may not always notice the face behind the churro stand, or the body attached to the hand giving you a tiny helmet full of ice cream, or even hear the offer of ice-cold beer from across the stadium, but each concessions staffer has been integral to the success of the MLB this year. One could go as far as to say that without them, there would not be a game to play. So, in recognition of all you do on and off our plates, we thank you." At press time, the recipients of the MVP award had announced plans to test the market in free agency this offseason.
