FORT MEADE, MD--Members of the National Security Agency told reporters yesterday that if they thought the electronic surveillance program known as PRISM invaded the privacy of law-abiding citizens, the newly updated PRISM 2.0 will be far, more invasive. "Who you call and for how long? That's child's play compared to what 2.0 is going to be able to do," NSA director General Keith B. Alexander said of the improved information-gathering program, which will not only be able to monitor emails and online chats, but, through satellite technology, will have the ability to eavesdrop on all telephone conversations and record any time an individual logs onto a wireless or 4G network. "PRISM 1.0 was a little glitchy, and now that we've smoothed out the bugs, well, your privacy, especially inside your own home, will be a thing of the past. The technology is so good that it will basically be as if a member of the NSA is standing right behind you at all times." Alexander also said that the next version of PRISM will have a slightly altered name, noting that there will be a Z in place of the S.
