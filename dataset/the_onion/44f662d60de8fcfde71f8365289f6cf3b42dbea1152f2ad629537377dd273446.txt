WASHINGTON--Saying it was a simple but effective measure to reduce potentially deadly incidents, a study published Monday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that 90 percent of bike accidents could be prevented by buying a car like a normal person. "Our data confirm that the vast majority of cyclist injuries can be avoided simply by driving an automobile instead of biking around like some weirdo," said lead researcher Dr. Laura Gafferty, adding that while bicycle riding was perfectly acceptable for children under 12, it was not recommended for any actual grown-up who wasn't competing in the Tour de France or similar event where it wasn't completely ridiculous. "Regular people drive cars because it's the normal and not the abnormal thing to do. If every cyclist purchased and operated a car like you're supposed to as an adult, bike fatalities would drop an estimated 40 percent within six months alone." Gafferty went on to say that people who biked for exercise should consider driving to a gym and using a stationary bike facing a wall of televisions like everyone else.
