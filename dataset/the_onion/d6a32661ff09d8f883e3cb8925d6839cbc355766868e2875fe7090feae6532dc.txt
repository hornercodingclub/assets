DURHAM, NC--Explaining that the global display of female solidarity will ultimately have no impact on the supposed problems it addresses, local man Lawrence Randall, who will participate in a boycott against the upcoming film , told reporters Wednesday that the Day Without A Woman strike won't accomplish anything. "No one's going to even notice," said Randall, who, as part of a "#DumpInfinityWar" social media campaign, will defiantly refuse to see the third installment of the popular Marvel franchise due to the repeated exclusion of Wolverine as a result of 20th Century Fox's ownership of X-Men characters' film rights."If they really want to change things, they should find a valid reason to protest and actually do something real. They're all clearly just doing it to feed their own egos." Randall, who blasted the women's strike as a "hissy fit that will accomplish absolutely zero," added that he was monitoring previews for this summer's and would not hesitate to stay home and watch it fail miserably.
