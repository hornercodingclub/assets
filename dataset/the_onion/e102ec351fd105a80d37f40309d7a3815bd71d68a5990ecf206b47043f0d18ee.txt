CHARLOTTE, NC--Saying it has already become a fixture in his daily routine, local 27-year-old Greg Weise installed a home pull-up bar to absentmindedly tap while passing through the hallway, sources confirmed Tuesday. "This bar just slips right over almost any doorframe, so it's really easy to inattentively tap it when I go in and out of my bedroom," said Weise, who added that the bar's padding is an excellent surface to idly drum his fingers on as he stands in the doorway. "It's really convenient to be able to occasionally grab the bar and then lean really far forward to sort of stretch a little bit. Finally, I have something to latch onto and dangle from for a few seconds before returning to sorting my laundry." At press time, Weise had reportedly also purchased a set of free weights to leave scattered on the ground and stub his toe on when he's not looking.
