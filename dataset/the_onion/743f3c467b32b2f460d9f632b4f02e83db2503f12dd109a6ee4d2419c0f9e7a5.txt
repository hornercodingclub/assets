SAN DIEGO--Chargers linebacker Junior Seau announced Wednesday that he would be retiring from football to spend more time tackling his two young sons Jake and Hunter and daughter Sydney. "Retirement will allow me to combine the joy of watching my children grow up with my passion for solid and aggressive contact," the 37-year-old Seau said in a press conference at Chargers training camp. "I'm really looking forward to wrapping up Sydney as she goes off on her first date, hitting Jake low on his first paper route, and blitzing little Hunter on camping trips." Seau went on to announce the creation of the Junior Seau Familial Recreation Fund, a new charitable foundation through which he will make it possible for his children to fulfill their dreams of roughhousing with a former professional athlete.
