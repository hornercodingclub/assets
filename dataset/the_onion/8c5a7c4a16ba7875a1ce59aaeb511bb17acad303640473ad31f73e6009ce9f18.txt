TOKYO--In the midst of a successful run with the Netherlands national team at the World Baseball Classic, starting pitcher Orlando Yntema told reporters Wednesday that his impressive performance at the tournament will give him increased leverage when entering contract negotiations with Holland's UVV Utrecht ballclub. "If I keep pitching like this, I'm definitely going to have the upper hand once I get to the bargaining table," said Yntema, who indicated that his 2.70 ERA at the WBC would ensure him "at least" a two-year, EUR60,000 contract extension with his Dutch rookie league team. "And if our squad manages to take this thing all the way, I'll be sitting pretty. Man, I would love to see the look on [UVV Chairman] Harm Janssen's face after we bring back the hardware." Yntema said that if UVV management fails to provide a fair deal, the 27-year-old would have no qualms about making his services available to any other team in the Honkbal Hoofdklasse League, including hated Utrecht rivals De Kroon Kinheim.
