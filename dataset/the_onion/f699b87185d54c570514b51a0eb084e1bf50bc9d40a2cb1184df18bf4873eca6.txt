Three years after his release from prison on dogfighting charges, Eagles quarterback Michael Vick confirmed that his family owns a dog and that the pet is "well cared for." What do think? "I can't believe he's allowed to do this after all the horrible things he's done in Philadelphia over the past three years." "This only increases the chance that a dog bites Vick's throwing hand and ruptures a tendon that ends his career, thus restoring balance to the universe. So I'm okay with it." "It's a shame to let all that equipment just sit there collecting dust."
