SOCHI, RUSSIA--U.S. figure skater Polina Edmunds confirmed Tuesday that, even as a little girl forced to mold herself into a champion in hopes of someday achieving success on her sport's highest stage, she has always dreamed of one day relaxing and having fun with her friends. "For as long as I can remember, I've only wanted one thing: to take off my skates and hang out with friends like a normal 15-year-old," the Olympian told reporters during an uninterrupted 14-hour practice session. "Truly, ever since I was 20 months old and my parents put me on the ice and told me I wanted to be a figure skater, I've always pictured myself someday playing, watching TV, and goofing around with other girls my age, all without having to think about triple lutzes and constantly monitoring my weight. That would be so nice." At press time, Edmunds' trainer was ordering her to stop talking to reporters and perform 300 stag jumps.
