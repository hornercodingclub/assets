HOUSTON--The Houston Astros, described by police as a 50-year-old franchise last seen wearing a white pinstriped uniform with its name on the front and known locally for performing baseball in front of downtown crowds for money, has been missing since at least last week, when it was reportedly expected to meet a franchise it knew in Milwaukee. "We were initially contacted Saturday by the owner, who had gone to check in on the Astros two days previously and found the team wasn't home," said city police chief Charles McClelland, adding that the Astros lived alone in Minute Maid Park, a public housing facility owned by the county. "People who were aware of the franchise say they didn't remember it really having any friends or loved ones, so that's partly why it's been difficult to pin down exactly when it went missing. The last time anyone can remember the Astros doing anything was in 2005, actually." McClelland also said the franchise may have been distraught after suffering heavy losses as of late and filing for bankruptcy, so police are treating the case as a possible suicide.
