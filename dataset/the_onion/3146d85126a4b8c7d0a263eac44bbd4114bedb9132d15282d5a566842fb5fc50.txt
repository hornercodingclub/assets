NEW YORK--In a discovery that flies in the face of conventional law enforcement wisdom of what does and does not constitute a deadly firearm, weapons and non-weapons experts alike reported Thursday that an array of objects including but not limited to steel pipes, wallets, and cell phones are not, in fact, guns. "After extensive research and careful analysis, we can definitively state that these objects are not guns and cannot inflict harm by firing bullets," said head researcher Jerome Morvis, whose team found no reason why, despite obvious differences in the size, shape, and color of the objects in question, the items so often appear as firearms to the not-completely-untrained eye. "To any law enforcement officer unsure about the object a civilian is holding, we recommend looking at the firearm in your own hand and looking back for parallels between its physical qualities and those of the object in a suspect's hands. If you find no similarities, the object does not pose an immediate danger." In related news, the experts have released a guide to help law enforcement officials discern the difference between a gun and an African American man's empty, upraised hand.
