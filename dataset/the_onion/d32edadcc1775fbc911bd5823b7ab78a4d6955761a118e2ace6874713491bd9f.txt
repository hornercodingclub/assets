WASHINGTON--Shielding her eyes from the harsh light as she shuffled into her kitchen Tuesday morning, a visibly hungover Michelle Obama reportedly readied her daughter Sasha for school by packing her a lunch box of leftover hors d'oeuvres from the previous night's Inaugural Ball. "Here you go, honey, have a nice day," the First Lady said while arranging an assortment of sorrel-wrapped goat cheese, duck confit, oysters a la poulette and other canapes into an insulated lunch pack. "Be good." At press time, sources reported that while Sasha Obama appreciated the variety of foods, she herself was too hungover to eat.
