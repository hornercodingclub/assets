SAN FRANCISCO--Upon coming across the same job posting Monday for a full-time position at a local startup company, an estimated 1,400 people reportedly described the opening as "a perfect fit" for their qualifications, saying it was exactly the opportunity they've been waiting for. "I have all the skills they want, my experience matches up--I honestly don't know if there's anyone out there better suited for this job than me," said unemployed man Charles Duncan, echoing the sentiments of 1,400 others, 900 of whom believe their facility with social media and knowledge of web design will definitely make their application "stand out from the rest of the pack." "This position just makes so much for me. My resume and cover letter might not get me the job outright, but once I go in for the interview they'll see why I'm ideal for it." Sources later confirmed a family friend of a top executive at the company had already accepted the position, which had been unofficially promised to him long before the job was even posted.
