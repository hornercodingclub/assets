The iconic British rock band the Rolling Stones made their debut at London's Marquee Club 50 years ago yesterday. What do think? "They're a towering example of how age truly doesn't matter. Except for the bassist guy who said, 'Fuck this, I'm too old for this shit,' and quit." Eliza Spurr * Cultural Center Worker "I'm not impressed unless their instruments are also 50 years old." Max Ochoa * Systems Analyst "Oh, it's pathetic because they're so old. Is that what you want me to say? Fuck you--you never wrote 'Moonlight Mile.'" Joe Kane * Public Radio Producer
