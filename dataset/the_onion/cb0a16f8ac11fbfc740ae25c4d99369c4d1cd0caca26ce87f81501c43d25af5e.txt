WASHINGTON--Having waited 11 months since the conclusion of last year's thrilling four-week campaign, millions of Americans are gearing up for the start of college basketball season on Mar. 18, sources confirmed Monday. "I love college basketball, so it's just great knowing that it's almost back," said 28-year-old Collin Shuster of Skokie, IL, echoing the thoughts of fans across the country who spent the winter excitedly reading various preseason rankings and team previews. "Obviously it'd be great if the season weren't so short, and it sucks that once a team loses a single game their whole year is over, but I suppose that's part of the reason college basketball is so exciting. I can't wait for the first game." Many Americans confirmed, however, that they only start closely paying attention halfway through the season, when only 16 teams remain in the field.
