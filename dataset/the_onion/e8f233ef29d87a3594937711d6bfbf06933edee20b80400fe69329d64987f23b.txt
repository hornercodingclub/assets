WASHINGTON--Former FBI Director James Comey was reportedly shocked Monday after suddenly realizing that he wrote his forthcoming memoir, , as a defense mechanism to subconsciously mask his true, romantic feelings for President Donald Trump. "Oh, my God, it just dawned on me, I'm head over heels in love with President Trump--he's all I think about, every hour of every day," said Comey, who abruptly began to comprehend that his autobiography was essentially a love letter written to the 71-year-old commander in chief. "I mean, if I didn't really like him, I'd just be apathetic, but I've been completely obsessed with Donald Trump for months now. Christ, it's all starting to make sense. The reason I was so upset when I got fired [as FBI director] was because I wouldn't get to spend time with him anymore. I know that he's a flawed leader, but I just want to fix him." At press time, Trump had taken to social media and dispatched several anger-filled tweets to obscure his deep, undying affection for Comey.
