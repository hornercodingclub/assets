During tonight's State of the Union address, President Obama will reportedly propose that Congress raise taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers, in part by closing a "trust fund loophole" protecting inherited money from taxes, and use the funds to expand tax credits for the middle class. What do think? "That's just like Obama to try to tax Americans out of their hard-earned inheritances." Aaron Green * Shrub Clearer "But if they close the trust fund loophole, the wealthy will have no option other than to avail themselves of the numerous other loopholes that allow them to circumvent their tax obligation." Samantha Hooper * Probation Officer "This is just the kind of impossible symbolic gesture the middle class needs." Marc Garza * Managing Director
