DAYTONA BEACH, FL--NASCAR has announced that their new partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation will allow young, terminally ill stock-car-racing fans to spend their last moments on Earth living out their fantasies of driving like Tony Stewart, Jimmie Johnson, and especially all-time favorite Dale Earnhardt. "We wanted to give kids with life-threatening medical conditions the chance to get into a 750-horsepower Nextel Cup car and experience what life is like on the ragged edge--and beyond," NASCAR public-relations associate Todd Linden said while helping a 13-year-old leukemia patient into a specially outfitted Monte Carlo with loose steering, a bad front-end push, and four weak tires. "We believe they deserve a chance to know what driving a race car is like before they die... even immediately before." Replacement cars for the program are paid for by the estate of the late Dale Earnhardt, whose relatives say would have loved to treat kids to the experience.
