WASHINGTON--Following his abrupt dismissal just 10 days after being named White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci reportedly received an outpouring of sympathetic texts Monday from friends and family expressing that they were "so fuckin' sorry to hear about this shit." "My deepest motherfuckin' condolences, Tony, it's terrible to hear you got shit-canned by these ass-munching cocks in D.C.," read a text message in part, just one of dozens sent by old buddies at Goldman Sachs, current business partners at SkyBridge Capital, and extended family in New Jersey in response to his "goddamn bullshit" dismissal. "Sorry to hear those bitches gave you the fucking ax, Mooch. That jackass [John] Kelly got no fucking clue what a good fuckin' dude you are. Just know your mother and I always got your fucking back." At press time, Scaramucci's New York office was reportedly filled with flower arrangements and handwritten cards lamenting that this was "absolute fucking trash."
