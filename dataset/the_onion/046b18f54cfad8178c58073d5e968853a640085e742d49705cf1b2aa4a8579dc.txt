SAN ANTONIO--Performing with rare efficiency and startling precision, the otherwise struggling Sacramento Kings perfectly executed their offense against the Spurs Friday, when the team ran a flawless throw-the-ball-out-of-bounds play. "John Salmons threw it out to the wing, [Jason] Thompson passes it me, and I send it right over DeMarcus Cousins' head out of bounds," said guard Tyreke Evans, who also contributed a textbook shoulder shrug and head shake to the play.  "It was a huge confidence builder to have everything go as planned. We might try something more complicated where the center sets a pick, rolls to the left, and I dribble the ball off my foot." At press time, Kings head coach Keith Smart was working with players on a new call-a-timeout-when-we-have-none-left play.
