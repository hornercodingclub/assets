WASHINGTON--Admitting there was simply too much on his plate right now to bring stability to the fractious region by end of day Friday, Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner quietly moved the task "solve Middle East crisis" to his to-do list for next week, sources reported Tuesday. "Ushering in lasting peace across the Mideast is definitely still a big priority for me, but given everything else I've got going on right now, I'm just going to need to bump it to next week when I have a little more time on my hands," Kushner reportedly said as he crossed out the task on his pocket day planner and rewrote it on the following page, acknowledging that he was just "too swamped" at the moment with policy reports and real estate development meetings to resolve the numerous wars, land disputes, and centuries-old ethnic and religious tensions that have long raged among the 350 million residents of the geopolitical hotspot. "I was really hoping to at least knock out the Arab-Israeli conflict before the weekend, but this week's kind of gotten out of hand. It'll be fine, though--I'll just carve out an hour or two next week, hunker down in my office, and sort it all out then. If I can push back a couple business calls, I can definitely get this whole Middle East situation ironed out by Wednesday--Thursday at the latest." At press time, Kushner reportedly pushed "solve Middle East crisis" back an additional 30 minutes after deciding it would be better to get "fix America's opioid epidemic" out of the way first.
