BOSTON--In a thrilling conclusion to the NHL Finals, the Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Boston Bruins in Game 6 of the championship series Monday night, securing the Stanley Cup for Chicago in a stunning win that hockey analysts agreed somewhat silenced Boston's typically vocal fan base. "Having to watch the Blackhawks hoist the Cup on the Bruins' home ice really quieted this crowd, to the extent that these people can be quieted," said ESPN hockey commentator Barry Melrose, adding that after the final horn sounded in TD Garden, you could just about hear a pin drop, in a sense. "This defeat has left Bostonians at a loss for words, comparatively. After last night, something tells me we won't be hearing a peep out of Bruin diehards for at least a few seconds." When contacted by reporters, Boston residents more or less declined to comment.
