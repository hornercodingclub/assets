A group of four minority congresswomen have pushed back after Trump told them to "go back to their country," accusing him of racism and stoking white nationalism. What do think? "I feel sorry for the Republicans who spent all those decades carefully crafting their party's delicate racist subtext." Brendon Shea * Hearth Tender "As a Trump supporter, I'm insulted by the implication that my white nationalism needs stoking." Clara Bender * Conspiracy Debunker "It's ridiculous that we're calling T rump's comments racist just because they seek to isolate and vilify someone based on their race." Greg Knowles * Salt Tosser
