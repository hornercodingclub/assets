Swimmers wearing Speedo's new laser-bonded LZR racing swimsuit have set 35 records in the past few weeks. Here's how the LZR gives competitors the advantage: Tightly compresses swimmer's body then squirts them across the pool Perfect for standing in with a puffed-out chest and head cocked up and slightly to the left Emits series of low clicks to help wearer find edge of pool Comes with free pool noodle NASA-researched design would keep swimmer alive and well should Olympic pool ever hurtle into dark vacuum of space Covered in Crisco to reduce drag Squeezes out all physical matter from swimmer until they become a Euclidean point with no magnitude, only position Powerful built-in scent glands attract rutting males as far as five nautical miles away Wearing it allows you to find out who your real friends are, that's for damn sure
