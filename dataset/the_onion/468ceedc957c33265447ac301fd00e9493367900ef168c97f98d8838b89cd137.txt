OAK BROOK, IL--Saying that the company is proud to support its customers in their darkest hour of sorrow, McDonald's representatives announced Tuesday that the fast food chain will begin offering lower bereavement pricing to patrons who have recently lost a loved one. "We all know the pain of losing a family member, and we here at McDonald's want to help assuage the anguish and stress of this difficult emotional period by offering grieving customers 10 percent off our signature burgers and premium McWraps, including our Bacon Habanero Ranch Quarter Pounder, which usually retails at $3.99, for just $3.59," said McDonald's spokesperson Troy Calhoun, noting that customers would simply have to supply the cashier or drive-thru attendant with the name and relationship of the deceased as well as a funeral home, hospice, or hospital contact number to receive the discount and a complimentary small soft drink. "During your family's time of mourning, you can take solace in knowing that McDonald's compassion discounts extend even to our seasonal promotional items, which currently include our spicy and satisfying bone-in Mighty Wings and our popular Shamrock Shake. In hard times such as these, let McDonald's be your comfort." Calhoun added that the offer is valid only within the first seven days of death and does not apply to Dollar Menu items.
