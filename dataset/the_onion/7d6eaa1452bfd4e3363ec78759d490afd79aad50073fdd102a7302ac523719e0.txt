INDIANAPOLIS--Financially challenged race organizers announced Wednesday that participants in the 2009 Indianapolis 500-Mile Race will be required to pay a $1 toll each time they cross the fabled Brickyard's start-finish line. "We have begun construction of tollbooths across the track that will allow drivers to stop and pay their tolls four-wide," Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman George said. "The outside booths off the racing line will be the dollar booths, accepting cash only, and the ones down low where the track is faster will be an extra quarter, which will add an exciting element of strategy to the race as well as generating cash we could really use at this point." Teams will also be given the option of paying $150 for a no-stop "Indy SpeedPass," which will allow them to go through the booth situated on the racing line at speeds of up to 35 mph.
