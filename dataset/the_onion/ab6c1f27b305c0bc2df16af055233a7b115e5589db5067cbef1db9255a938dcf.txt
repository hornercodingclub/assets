DENVER--Standing solemnly next to the patch of ground where the veteran quarterback's body lay, members of the Denver Broncos organization quietly buried Peyton Manning in an unmarked grave next to Sports Authority Field at Mile High, sources confirmed Thursday. "You were a good quarterback...and a good man," Broncos general manager John Elway said as he shoveled the last bit of soil onto Manning's grave, leaving only a small mound of dirt to signify the longtime NFL star's final resting place near the stadium's Gate 8 entrance. "We'll never forget you. Rest well, old friend." At press time, the Broncos released a statement ruling Manning out for the rest of the season with a reoccurrence of the plantar fascia injury in his left foot.
