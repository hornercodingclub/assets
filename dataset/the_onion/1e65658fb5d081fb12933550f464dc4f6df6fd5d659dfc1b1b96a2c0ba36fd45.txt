OAKLAND, CA--As Raiders owner Mark Davis reaches out for advisers in the wake of his father Al Davis' death, the team's front office confirmed Tuesday that former coach John Madden has agreed to come back to Oakland and serve as a consultant for stadium concessions. "The Raiders have a lot of good pieces already in place--cheeseburgers, hot dogs, popcorn, ice cream--but I want to help them think of new opportunities," said Madden, holding a binder labeled "playbook" and smeared with nacho-cheese residue. "I mean, you've got all that butter and relish lying around and they're not even using their imagination. They've got two locations for burritos, which I love, but neither of them are sticking Italian sausages inside there. You take that sausage-stuffed burrito, wrap it in bacon, and deep-fry it--now you're talking about real stadium concessions." While expressing appreciation to Madden, who has lent his services free of charge, Raiders management admitted the former NFL analyst has cost the organization nearly $1,200 per day in food and food-prep labor.
