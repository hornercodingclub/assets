WASHINGTON--According to a report released Monday by the Professional Association of Custom Clothiers, NFL players, especially offensive linemen, generally look really weird in suits. "The suits themselves are actually very nice, but something about NFL players' bodies just make the whole thing look very awkward," the report read in part, adding that an aspect of the initial weirdness is that NBA players "just look way better" in suits than NFL players do. "And it's not that the suits don't fit correctly, either. It's hard to explain. It's just that bizarre combination of very thick necks and plump heads jutting out of common business attire that looks plain off." The report concluded that even the quarterbacks "look like they're wearing a costume or something."
