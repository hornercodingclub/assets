SANFORD, FL--With election day looming, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney tried one last time Monday to cut into Barack Obama's large lead among Latino voters by putting on an elaborate celebration for his wife, Ann. "Today, Ann became a woman," said Romney, who mentioned that he helped Ann choose the gorgeous, jeweled white-and-yellow dress she wore as she danced a traditional waltz for an audience assembled in the basement of the Spanish Church of God. "From the cutting of the cake, to the 15-candle ceremony, to the changing of the shoes that symbolized her changing from girlhood to womanhood, this was Ann's very own special day. We are all so proud of her." Sources also confirmed the customary gift-giving reception following the garnered several hundred thousand dollars in donations for the Romney campaign.
