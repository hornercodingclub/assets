BEDFORD, NH--Amidst consideration of new safety regulations that would ban the use of aluminum bats in Little League competition, a small but outspoken minority of players including Bedford's Jeff Priest are fascinated by the prospect of taking another player's life with a well-hit baseball. "Sure, it'd be tragic, and I'd hate for it to happen to me or anyone I know, " said Priest, thoughtfully running his hands over the aluminum bat he used last season, "but to see, say, the pitcher go down for good after your batted ball hit him in the head, or maybe right above his heart... I just think it's something you'd never forget is all." Priest's teammates generally agreed that the experience would be "pretty cool," but declined his subsequent invitation to throw him some batting practice.
