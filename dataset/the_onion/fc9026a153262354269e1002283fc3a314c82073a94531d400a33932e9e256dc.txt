WASHINGTON--Noting that the individuals in question may be extremely mentally disturbed or suffering from a serious psychological illness, the nation's psychiatrists announced Wednesday that they are deeply concerned for the estimated 5 percent of Americans who were found in nationwide polls this week to approve of the U.S. Congress. "With numerous members of Congress refusing to negotiate an end to the shutdown in the face of widespread federal furloughs and a looming deadline to avoid defaulting on government debt, we are extremely concerned for the mental health of those Americans who responded, 'Yes, we think Congress is doing a good job,'" psychiatrist Dr. Donald Levin said in a press conference this morning, telling reporters that the estimated 15.5 million Americans who approve of Congress are likely "very troubled" citizens who may in fact be experiencing psychotic episodes or delusional thoughts. "We're not entirely sure who these people are or where they come from--perhaps they are psych ward patients, or unstable recluses living in remote huts on the outskirts of society--but what we do know is that they are extremely disconnected from reality and in need of immediate attention if they are not already receiving it. We need to find these people and get them the help they need before their illnesses get worse." Psychiatrists added that because a number of mental health services are currently furloughed, many respondents would just have to "sit tight and hang in there" until the shutdown is resolved.
