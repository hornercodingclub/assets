COLUMBUS, OH--Thryssskmsss, a 2-year-old barn funnel weaver spider, confided to friends Wednesday that she isn't sure she's ready for 3,000 children at this point in her life. "There's so much I want to do--explore the world's dark cracks, visit the drainpipes, see what it's like to eat a dragonfly--but I can't do those things if I've got several hundred spiderlings clinging to every leg," the spider said from the eaves of her Columbus home. "If I had 3,000 hungry mandibles to feed, I'd be in the web catching flies all day, and that's just not where I'm at right now." Thryssskmsss added that she expects one day she'll be ready to settle down and find a nice male to mate with and then devour.
