RIO RANCHO, NM--After months spent deliberating the best option for their family, members of the Cooper household decided on Monday to move their elderly aunt Joyce Reynolds into their collective subconscious. "The truth is we've been planning this for a while, and I think we'll all just rest easier knowing she's there," said Reynolds' nephew Mike Cooper of relocating the 86-year-old to the back of their minds, noting that, at this stage in her life, the most sensible place for her was well below their conscious awareness. "Obviously it's not the perfect solution, but when a relative gets to be that age, it's great to not have to worry about them all the time." Cooper went on to say that his aunt would not be lonely in the family's subconscious, as they had moved Uncle Albert there two years earlier.
