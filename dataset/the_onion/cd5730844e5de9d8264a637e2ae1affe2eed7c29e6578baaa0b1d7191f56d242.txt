A new computer virus that targets Iran's nuclear facilities is believed to be causing AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" to blast at full volume from Iranian scientists' workstations in the middle of the night. What do think? "My God, someone has hijacked AC/DC's art and turned it into a weapon." Brendan Mulcahy * Systems Analyst "Oh, yeah, I think those assholes at WZBB have the same virus." Fletcher Holic * Gunsmith "AC/DC is a good start. Then, slowly, they can be introduced to Boston, then some Rush, then Judas Priest, and then on to Motorhead, after which they'll be so enlightened that they'll discontinue any nuclear weapons program." Brittany Tobias * Salvage Inspector
