FOXBOROUGH, MA--Assuring that the team knew exactly what it would take to win, fired-up Patriots players told reporters Sunday they were ready to give a full 60, maybe 70 percent against Jacksonville. "We are pumped for this showdown, and the Jags are going to see two-thirds, maybe three-fourths of our best--if the game seems close," said Rob Gronkowski, who revealed the Patriots have been going pretty decently hard in practice all week while devoting whole minutes to watching game tape on the Jaguars defense. "It's going to take nothing less than perfectly average execution to prevail today. Coach [Belichick] got us jacked up when he told us that if want to get past Jacksonville, he was going to need our B, or possibly B-minus game." Gronkowski added that he wouldn't be happy with his performance today unless he left about half of what he has out on the field.
