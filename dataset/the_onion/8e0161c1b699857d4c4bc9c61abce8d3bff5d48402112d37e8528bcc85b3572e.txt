Calvin Klein was widely criticized this week after recruiting a model who wears a size 10 to appear in an ad campaign for its "Perfectly Fit" plus-size clothing line in what many believe promotes an inaccurate view of women's bodies, though the company stressed that it never actually called the model plus-size. What do think? "But if the model weighed as much as the average customer, how would anybody be psychologically manipulated into buying anything?" Bill Paulson * Guidance Counselor "It seems like whether clothing companies promote images of extremely thin women as normal or promote images of slightly more normal-looking women as fat, they just can't win." Matthew Carolan * Tool Demonstrator "Just tell me straight up: Is my body shameful enough to need to buy these clothes or what?" Janelle Jordon * Decorations Committee Chair
