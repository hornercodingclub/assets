LOS ANGELES--Nearly three years after being embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal involving allegations that Brett Favre sent her a series of suggestive text messages, model and media personality Jenn Sterger revealed to reporters Friday that she continues to receive vulgar texts from the retired quarterback on a regular basis. "I would say that I get at least five or six texts from him every single day, and sometimes as many as 20 or 30," said Sterger, noting that she has yet to reply to a single one of the 20-year NFL veteran's thousands and thousands of obscene electronic advances. "Usually it'll be more innocent stuff like 'I'm touching it right now' or 'I want to explode inside you,' but it can sometimes get super graphic if Brett feels like I'm ignoring him. What's annoying is that I've changed my phone number like four times since this started happening, and he keeps finding my new one. I just want to move on with my life already." When reached for comment, Favre responded with seven different photos of what was presumably his erect penis.
