Journalist and heavy metal vocalist Danica Roem became Virginia's first openly transgender legislator Tuesday by defeating Republican incumbent Robert Marshall. What do think? "I knew she'd be our next legislator ever since seeing her open for Scar Symmetry last year." Barbara Culver * Rodeo Medic "Socially progressive metalheads always vote in record numbers during off-year elections." Edward Jaen * Glass Froster "I hope her political career delivers the same raucous, back-to-basics heaviness as her musical work." Brian Chelsey * Garment Tagger
