PHILADELPHIA--Stressing the importance of hearing all sides of a story, open-minded man Brendan Kelly told reporters Friday that he always tries to get his news from a variety of Facebook friends. "For a long time, I'd just get news from my buddy Mark, but then I realized how much I was closing myself off to other perspectives," said Kelly, adding that it is all too easy to get caught up in narrow ways of thinking, and that he now seeks out at least three or four of his friends' posts on any given topic to ensure he's getting the full picture. "I'll check out high school friends, college friends, work friends--it's important to get a good mix. I'd be doing myself a real disservice if I blindly believed claims my friend Kevin made without at least trying to verify them with comments from Heather or Dan. You can't just accept whatever's fed to you, you know?" Kelly went on to say that while it was essential to get his news from a variety of Facebook friends, it was equally important to avoid obviously fringe sources such as Doug.
