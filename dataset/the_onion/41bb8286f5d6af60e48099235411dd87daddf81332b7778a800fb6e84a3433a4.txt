SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA--Midway through a friendly pickup basketball game at the San Luis Obispo County YMCA Thursday, players from both teams confirmed that neither side has made a single shot in well over two hours. "I think I remember the guy in the Lakers T-shirt sinking a jumper early on, but that had to have been at least a couple of hours ago," 31-year-old Michael Torres told reporters, noting that the game has consisted of approximately 80 missed lay-ups, dozens of off-target fadeaways, and more than 150 air balls since the last basket. "I hit the rim on a three-pointer maybe 45 minutes ago, and at one point, [teammate] Adam [Burke] almost had a tip-in until it took a bad bounce off the backboard. That's about as close as anyone's come that I can remember, though. Man, it's getting late." At press time, the score of the game was still 2-0.
