After production on moved to a remote island off the coast of Ireland, ornithologists and wildlife conservationists expressed anger at J.J. Abrams and the production crew over concerns that filming disrupted the mating rituals of local bird populations like puffins and peregrine falcons. What do think? "What these bird lovers need to realize is that fans will kill every bird in sight if this delays the film's release." Steve Galindez * Dentures Molder "Still, you have to admire J.J. Abrams for actually going out and disrupting nature rather than just CGI-ing it." Amy Menapace * Basket Weaver "I'm just excited that might feature two puffins going at it in the background."
