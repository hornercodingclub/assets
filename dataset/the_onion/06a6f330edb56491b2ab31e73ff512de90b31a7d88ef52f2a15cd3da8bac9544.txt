SANTA CLARA, CA--Following his team's 24-10 win in Super Bowl 50, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning ended weeks of speculation surrounding his future by announcing Sunday that he has at least one more surgery in him. "I've had a long run and been a part of a lot of pretty big surgeries, but I still think I've got one more major operation left in the tank," said Manning, adding that he had deliberated for the past six months with friends, family, and medical specialists before deciding that he wasn't ready to hang up his hospital gown for good. "Ultimately, I have to listen to my body, but I'll keep going as long as I can still handle the anesthesia. I just can't imagine myself never being under those bright lights in the operating room again. I'll get on the gurney one more time and then ride off into the sunset." Manning refused to comment, however, when asked whether he would undergo his next surgery in Denver or potentially at a medical center in Los Angeles.
