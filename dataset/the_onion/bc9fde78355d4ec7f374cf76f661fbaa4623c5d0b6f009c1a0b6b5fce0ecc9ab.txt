Best player in league at smiling after the catch; phenomenal jumper, but also remarkable at standing perfectly still; great route runner in the way that's actually not a euphemism for "slow as shit" Expressing emotions such as sadness, anger, or surprise; brings a fire to the game, which the league is tired of reminding him is not only against the rules but also the law; makes the game look easy, which really doesn't help the players union's cause in labor disputes Runs right past everyone in secondary while informing cornerback that he's supposed to cover Packers receiver Greg Jennings Driver had the chance to be a world-class high jumper but instead opted to pursue something that isn't fucking stupid Muscular lips capable of grinding out an extra smile late in the game
