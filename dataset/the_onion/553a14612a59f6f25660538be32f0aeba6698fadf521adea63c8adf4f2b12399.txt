--Following further testing this week, the Washington Redskins announced Wednesday that their playoff hopes were still officially listed as questionable. "We'll just have to continue to assess the situation and see how it looks at the end of the week," said head coach Mike Shanahan, adding that the team's postseason prospects would be re-evaluated before this weekend's game against the Cleveland Browns. "We've seen some encouraging signs in the past day or two, but at this point, it's still questionable." Shanahan confirmed that the sole glimmer of hope for the entire Redskins organization would likely be a "game-time decision."
