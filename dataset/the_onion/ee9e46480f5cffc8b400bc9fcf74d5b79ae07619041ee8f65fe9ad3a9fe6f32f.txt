--Grumbling that "it doesn't take any longer to get this stuff right than it does to get it wrong," Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood reportedly spent three hours this weekend proofreading, correcting, and in some cases rewriting Wikipedia's error-riddled roundabout entry. "Oh, come on, who edits this stuff?" said LaHood, shaking his head while deleting a "completely erroneous" paragraph from the section on marked-perimeter cycle lanes. "Someone who didn't know any better could read this and come away thinking a roundabout is no different than a dumbbell interchange. If you're going to write about this stuff, you owe it to the public to get it right. I'm afraid to even click on the cloverleaf page." Sources confirmed that after adding an entirely new paragraph on recommended signaling etiquette, LaHood updated the secretary of transportation entry to note in its first sentence that holders of the office are 14th in the line of presidential succession.
