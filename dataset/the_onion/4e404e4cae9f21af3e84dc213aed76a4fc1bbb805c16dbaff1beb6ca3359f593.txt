: The Royal Baby's First Words LONDON--Mere hours after Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton gave birth, excited sources close to the family reported that the royal newborn has already uttered his very first words. "Apparently, the little bundle of joy simply couldn't keep quiet about all the excitement and has already surprised the Royal Family with a few words of his own," said contributor Jennifer Gibb, who acquired a short recording of the infant's words from an anonymous source within Buckingham Palace. "The eager young prince supposedly has a lot on his mind, and I think I speak for everyone when I say the whole world is waiting to hear what he has to say!" Sources added that shortly after speaking his first words, the hungry infant then cried for more food.
