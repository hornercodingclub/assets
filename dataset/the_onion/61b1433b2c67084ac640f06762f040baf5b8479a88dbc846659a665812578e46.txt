spinoff premieres Tuesday night, featuring John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, and the rest of the Conners family pressing on without Roseanne Barr, who was fired from the show earlier this year after posting racist comments on Twitter.

Evan Townsend * Systems Analyst "Wow, being just sort of dimly aware of this show isn't the same without her." Walter Ratcliffe * Improvisational Baker "Sorry, that's when reruns of are on."
