FRANKLIN, WI--Weighing various options for how to proceed given the unexpectedness of the situation, local 33-year-old Trevor Clifford was reportedly at a complete loss as to what he should do Monday after suddenly finding himself in a good mood. "Jeez, do I go outside or call someone up or something? I really have no clue what you're supposed to do here," said Clifford, who admitted he couldn't remember the last time he felt so cheerful or what he did when such a feeling last struck him. "I guess I could eat something, or maybe watch TV. Boy, I don't want to waste this, but I don't want to ruin it, either. I'm totally stumped on this." At press time, Clifford resolved to just stay seated and wait for the mood to pass.
