DOVER, DE--Following local couple Mark and Diane Raftery's 25-year wedding anniversary this weekend, friends and family reportedly reflected on the pair's milestone by mistaking the length of their relationship for its quality. "Wow, 25 years is incredible--it's a true testament to the bond Mark and Diane share," said one acquaintance, believing that the sheer passage of time since the two married indicates the presence of a deep and meaningful emotional connection that actually enriches both of their lives. "It's so great to see them together after all these years. Not that many couples can say they've lasted that long. They definitely have something special." Those close to the Rafterys are also said to have mistakenly referred to their paralyzing fear of being alone as "true love."
