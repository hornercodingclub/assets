NEW YORK--The entire Yankees squad poured off the bench, out of the dugout, and onto the field Monday after CC Sabathia reacted to a particularly strenuous inning by plopping down on the bench, stretching out, and taking a nap. "When that happens to your pitcher, you just have to support him and get out of the way," said shortstop Derek Jeter, who was one of the first Yankees on his feet when Sabathia began to recline. "In that situation, a good teammate just lets his pitcher sleep. It doesn't matter if he's right or wrong." Umpires were able to clear the field and play resumed shortly after Sabathia woke, although team medics have not yet been able to return Sabathia to an upright position
