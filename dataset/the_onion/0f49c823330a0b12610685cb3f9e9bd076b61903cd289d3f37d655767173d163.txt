TAMPA, FL--Saying they had been so swept up in the excitement of the moment that they hadn't been paying attention to what they were shouting, the crowd at a Donald Trump rally in Tampa reportedly came to the realization Wednesday that they had been chanting the phrase "We are frightened and helpless" for the past half hour. "Looking back on it now, I guess we all started chanting 'We're so, so scared' as soon as we got into the auditorium, and then when Trump came out onstage, it really picked up and we added the part about feeling completely impotent in the face of change," said Trump supporter Colby Swanson, 45, who explained that, after thinking back, some attendees had started chanting "Rage is my only outlet" on and off while they were waiting in line to enter the event. "Boy, we were chanting it really loud for a while, especially after Trump said our country doesn't win anymore and that we shouldn't let Muslim refugees into the U.S. Come to think of it, towards the end there, I remember just yelling 'The world has passed me by' over and over again." After recognizing their embarrassing blunder, the Trump supporters were said to have collected themselves and returned to their traditional chant of "Build the wall."
