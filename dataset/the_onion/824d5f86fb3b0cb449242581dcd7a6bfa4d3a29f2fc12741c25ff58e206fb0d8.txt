FOXBOROUGH, MA--Following news that free agent quarterback Tim Tebow was acquired by the New England Patriots, sources close to the organization told reporters Tuesday that they expect the high-profile signing to at long last draw some media attention to the oft-ignored football franchise. "With a guy like Tebow on board, I've got a feeling that we're finally going to be seeing some cameras in our locker room," said team CEO Robert Kraft, who aired his frustrations that his small-market football club traditionally has been overshadowed by such media darlings as the Cincinnati Bengals and the Tennessee Titans, adding his personal belief that sports journalists generally hold a bias against East Coast teams like the Patriots. "Yep, this move is going to put us on the map. They might even send over some reporters from ESPN to do a story about , the New England Patriots. Imagine that!" Kraft added that the presence of a famous player such as Tebow could perhaps lend some publicity to routinely overlooked members of the Patriots organization such as Rob Gronkowski, Bill Belichick, and Tom Brady.
