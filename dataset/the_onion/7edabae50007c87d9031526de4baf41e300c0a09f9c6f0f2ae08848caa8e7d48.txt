SEATTLE--ESPN medical personnel confirmed Tuesday that analyst Steve Young suffered a traumatic brain injury Monday night while attempting to explain the referees' confusing ruling of a touchdown on the last play of the Packers, Seahawks game. "It's evident that the replacement referees' questionable, game-deciding call exerted a significant amount of trauma on Mr. Young's brain and caused him to temporarily lose consciousness while attempting to grasp the rationale of calling that play a touchdown," said neurologist Richard Spencer, adding that the woozy Young was helped off the ESPN broadcasting set immediately following his disoriented plea for the NFL to bring back the regular officials. "Given Mr. Young's history, this is certainly serious. It's not surprising that he's exhibiting signs of cognitive impairment. That ball was intercepted." As of Tuesday morning, Young was reportedly resting comfortably at the Harbor View Medical Center saying that the last thing he remembers from Monday night was Golden Tate pushing a defender squarely in the back and knocking him to the ground before the final pass came down.
