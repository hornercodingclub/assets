CLEVELAND--During a press conference following the first game of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, Cleveland Cavaliers star forward LeBron James requested that reporters give him "just a second" as he struggled to name a single player on his team aside from himself. "Well, um, let's see, they got... LeBron James, so that's one," said James, extending his thumb to represent the number of players he had named thus far.  "What about Carlos Boozer? He's still on the Cavs, right? Yeah, Carlos has been doing great." After talking with teammate Zydrunas Ilgauskas later that night about their heartbreaking loss, James said his biggest regret was that he might never get to see "that nice man" ever again.
