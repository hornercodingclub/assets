VIENNA--Recognizing its prominent position in the night sky and 4.5 billion years of service to the solar system, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs voted Tuesday to add Venus to the Registry of Historically Significant Planets. "From the beginning of the protoplanetary era to the present day, Venus has contributed tremendously to our planetary system, serving as an anchor to the inner planets whose brightness and surface temperature remain unparalleled," said UNOOSA director Simonetta Di Pippo, adding that the terrestrial body would be honored with a 3'-by-3' embossed bronze plaque that will be installed in its orbit during a ceremony honoring the planet next month. "We hope that this distinction will help to preserve and protect Venus, and ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy its slow, retrograde rotation, Earthlike size, and ultra-dense atmosphere for many years to come." Venus will join Saturn and Neptune as the sole members of the registry.
