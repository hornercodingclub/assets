WEXFORD, PA--Despite his assertions that this year was shaping up to be one of the most wide-open and exciting tournaments in recent memory, sources confirmed Monday that local man Nick Moreno continued to struggle in his efforts to sign anyone up for his NIT bracket pool. "Hey guys, just a reminder to get in your NIT brackets and 10 bucks by the end of the day today," Moreno said to a group of stone-faced coworkers who had barely skimmed his latest email encouraging everyone to "get in on the action" by making their predictions for the field of 32. "I bet most of you will have Georgia State going all the way this year, but, I don't know, I think St. Mary's really has a shot at the title as a four-seed. But we can talk picks after everyone's brackets are in. And if anyone needs me to send the password for the group again, just let me know." At press time, Moreno had sent a last-minute email offering to lower the buy-in fee to five dollars.
