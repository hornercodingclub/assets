CHORGES, FRANCE--With the grueling mountain stages now finished, excitement surrounding the Tour de France reached a fever pitch on Wednesday as cyclists began the eighteenth leg of the race, also known as the doping-officials-begin-gathering-evidence-to-prove-that-the-eventual-champion-used-performance-enhancing-drugs stage. "Chris Froome's strong showing during the time trial stages has given him a commanding lead, but will that prepare him for the very tricky steroid-allegation phase of the race?" said commentator Phil Liggett, explaining that over the next few days, the field of over 100 cycling officials will scrutinize Froome's performance in search of proof that he is guilty of doping. "Froome knows this is a treacherous stage where many talented riders--including his rival Alberto Contador--have faltered in the past, so he'll need to be careful and watch out for a late push by the U.K. Anti-Doping Agency to prove his guilt and strip him of his victory." Following the conclusion of the eighteenth leg, the Tour de France will reportedly move on to the everybody-ignores-the-sport-of-cycling stage.
