WASHINGTON--Urging supporters to help out and chip in as much as they can, the Joe Biden presidential campaign sent a fundraising email Thursday reminding donors that sexual assault allegations don't bury themselves. "Now, more than ever, the Biden campaign needs your support in sweeping this under the rug," read the email in part, calling on each and every Biden supporter to do their part in defeating Donald Trump by looking the other way. "We'll be honest--this isn't going to be cheap. It's not just going away like we thought it would. We know it seems like we can coast off the media suppressing the story, but there's a lot of important work to be done behind the scenes to ensure these accusations never see the light of day. These sexual assault allegations have already broken through to , and if we don't meet our fundraising goal by midnight tonight, it could be front page news tomorrow. " The email added that if supporters donated $25 or more, the campaign would express their thanks by sending them a free "Allegations? What Allegations?" bumper sticker.
