DETROIT--Jubilant Lions fans, players, and coaches alike continue to ride the wave of good feelings and positive thinking that began after the team lost by only a single touchdown to the talented and efficient New England Patriots Sunday, a fact they say negates anything else the Patriots achieve this season. "For a team like ours to hold a lead against a team like that going into the fourth quarter... As far as we're concerned, an era ended with that game," Lions GM Matt Millen said Monday. "Tom Brady had to pull 15 points out of nowhere to beat us, didn't he? That's the sort of last-minute heroics that can haunt a team forever." Patriots coach Bill Belichick, while not willing to declare the Patriots' season a washout, admitted disappointment that his team "wound up playing that three-ring retard circus of a joke team so damn close."
