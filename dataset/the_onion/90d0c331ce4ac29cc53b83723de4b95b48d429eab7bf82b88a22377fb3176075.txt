LONDON--A new study published this week in the journal Animal Behaviour revealed that house cats only meow when they want to alert their owners that they just witnessed a neighbor's murder while looking out a window. "Through direct observation and analysis of feline vocal patterns, we were able to confirm that the sound commonly known as a 'meow' is in fact a signal that a gruesome homicide has just been committed next door," said study's author and King's College professor Debra T. Shen, Ph.D., noting that if a cat meows during the day, it has seen a shooting or stabbing, whereas a nighttime meow indicates death by strangulation. "It also appears as though the volume and number of meows correlates to the number of victims and the amount of blood--a trait that likely evolved as a way to discreetly call for help without drawing the killer's attention." Shen added that the findings have lent credence to the long-held theory that cats purr to signal that someone is hiding right behind the curtains.
