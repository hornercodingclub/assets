MIAMI--Sportscaster Bob Costas interrupted the scripture reading at the funeral of slain Washington Redskins player Sean Taylor Monday, elbowing Pastor Antowyn Mells away from the podium, seizing the microphone, and then speaking at length in obscure sports references while extemporaneously eulogizing the Pro Bowl safety. "Looking across the sea of faces that have been brought together to honor a great man and a great athlete, I can see a range of emotions from sadness, to anger, to outrage," Costas told a stunned and confused crowd of thousands mourners. "Sadly, Sean Taylor was taken before his time, much as my beloved Mickey Mantle, Pancho Herrera, and Pumpsie Green... I am just as shocked and dismayed as anyone at how my mom could throw away those baseball cards." According to sources attending the memorial, Costas never mentioned Taylor after his initial comments, but did spend 45 minutes fondly recalling the men's 20-kilometer biathlon at the 1994 Winter Olympics at Lillehammer.
