LOS ANGELES--Nearly two years after the HBO drama's early cancellation due to animal rights concerns, the producers of confirmed yesterday that they continue to cripple and euthanize horses on a regular basis. "After production on the series shut down, we pretty much just switched to killing horses full-time; we probably finished off the original herd in about a week," said producer and show creator David Milch, who explained that he, producers Michael Mann and Carolyn Strauss, and the rest of the crew now receive a fresh shipment of purebreds each week, running the horses until they collapse in painful throes of agony and a veterinarian must be sent onto the track to put them down. "Sometimes Dustin Hoffman still stops by to help out with the killings. We all miss the show, but it's great that we've been able to continue our work on this level, at least." Sources at HBO reported that the producers plan to explore the world of dog racing next.
