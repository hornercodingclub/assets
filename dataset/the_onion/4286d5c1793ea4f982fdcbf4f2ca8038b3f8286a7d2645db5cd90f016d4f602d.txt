WASHINGTON--After Republican lawmakers reached a last-minute agreement Wednesday night to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling, sources confirmed today that the GOP yielded its fight against Obamacare mere moments before the president was about to cave and repeal the entire law. "Whew! That was a close one," President Obama told reporters, admitting that literally seconds before he would have put pen to paper on an executive order to fully defund and eliminate the Affordable Care Act, he received a phone call informing him that House Speaker John Boehner had agreed to back down from the shutdown stalemate. "The GOP really had our backs up against the wall on this one, and to be honest I was definitely about to blink first. I sure as hell didn't want to be the president who oversaw the first default in our country's history, and I thought the Republicans knew that. If they would have just held out a little longer--I'm talking two, three seconds--they would have gotten everything they wanted. They seriously held all the cards here." The president said that if House Republicans threaten to use the same tactics with the debt ceiling this February, he'll probably just repeal Obamacare immediately.
