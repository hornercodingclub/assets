BOSTON--Several questions into a postgame press conference Sunday, it became increasingly clear that Los Angeles Angels players had forgotten they dedicated the 2009 season to deceased teammate Nick Adenhart. "Oh my God, that's right," Angels pitcher John Lackey said after his team's victory over the Boston Red Sox. "Now that you mention it, yes, I do vaguely remember pitching in Nick's memory in April. Anyway, yeah, I guess this one was for Nick then." Lackey added that the Adenhart patch on his uniform now makes a lot more sense.
