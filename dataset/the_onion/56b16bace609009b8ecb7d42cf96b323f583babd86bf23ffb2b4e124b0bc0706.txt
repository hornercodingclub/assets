LOUISVILLE, KY--Aiming to fine-tune his mechanics after returning from a recent back surgery, golf star Tiger Woods told reporters at the PGA Championship Wednesday that he is currently working on building a new swing that doesn't send waves of intense pain through every single inch of his body. "I've been making some adjustments in my posture and rhythm--a lot of minor things, really--so I can have a consistent drive without feeling excruciating, white-hot pain in my back, arms, legs, and neck," said Woods, adding that he has been working with coach Sean Foley to develop a follow-through that doesn't cause his eyes to water from an agonizing throbbing sensation that radiates across his entire body. "Right now, I'm just experimenting with a slightly tweaked motion to see where I can strike a good balance between a powerful stroke and a level of pain I can actually tolerate without blacking out. But it's a process, so I'll have to be patient while working out all the kinks." Woods later confirmed that he is also looking to make a slight adjustment to his grip that will allow him to hold his driver without immediately doubling over and vomiting.
