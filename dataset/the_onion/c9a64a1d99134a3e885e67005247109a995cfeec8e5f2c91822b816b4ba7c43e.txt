The U.S. Department of Justice blocked a Texas law requiring voters to present a state-issued photo ID before casting a ballot, saying it unfairly discriminated against Hispanics. What do think? "This law seems redundant, anyway. Can't Texans see for themselves without photo IDs which individuals are minorities who should be intimidated from going to the polls?" Kathy Wakeling * Sterilizer "I agree. The sensitive, melancholic constitution of the Hispanic is far too delicate for the rigors of waiting in a DMV office." Tyler Epkins * Systems Analyst "The Justice Department is setting a clear double standard: It's not okay to discriminate against Hispanics, but it is okay to discriminate against racist whites who don't want Hispanics to vote?"
