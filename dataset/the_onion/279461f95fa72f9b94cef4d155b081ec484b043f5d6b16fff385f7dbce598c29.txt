NEW YORK--After 54 years of waiting, the New York Rangers finally won the Stanley Cup 15 years ago, defeating the Vancouver Canucks four games to three in 1994. "As long as I live I will never forget this moment," Rangers' captain Mark Messier, who recently confirmed he had not forgotten the moment in the intervening decade and a half, said at the time. Coach Mike Keenan is remembered to have added that the victory "[was] for the greatest fans in the world. This definitely[might have been] the start of a new Rangers dynasty! I can't wait to meet President Clinton. Let's go Rangers!" The 2009 Pittsburgh Penguins had no comment about the year 2024.
