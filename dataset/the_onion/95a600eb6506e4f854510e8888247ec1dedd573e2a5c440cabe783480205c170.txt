MIAMI--Following the Cleveland Cavaliers' Wednesday night loss to the fourth-place Detroit Pistons, LeBron James attempted to point out as gently as possible why leaving the 8-45 basketball team was probably the best decision he could have made. "So, you guys kind of get why I did that now?" James asked reporters, holding up a newspaper showing the Eastern Conference standings and coughing. "I mean, you know, they've lost 26 games in a row. That's a lot of games. I'm good, but I fully admit I can't lead a team like that to the title. Sure, I could have gone about leaving in a much better fashion, but come on, right?" James added that he meant no offense by his comments and that he was "just saying."
