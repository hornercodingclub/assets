GREENSBURG, PA--While engaged in a casual conversation about their favorite bands Thursday, sources confirmed local resident Nick Saccia, 29, summarily abandoned one of his most strongly held convictions after sensing that his friend half-heartedly disagreed with it. "No, no, I totally hear that," said Saccia, instantaneously caving to his acquaintance's slight divergence of opinion and practically tripping over himself to calibrate a response that would bury his well-thought-out beliefs about a subject he has long felt passionately about. "I mean, yeah, that's a great point. I never thought they were great or anything--they're just okay. Absolutely." At press time, Saccia was racing to redirect the discourse to a comfortable area of mutual agreement where they could safely carry out the remainder of the discussion by voicing identical opinions.
