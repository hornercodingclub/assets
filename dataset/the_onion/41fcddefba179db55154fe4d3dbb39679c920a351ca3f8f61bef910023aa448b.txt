VERONA, WI--Having waited until everyone at the table had finished their dinner Monday, a knowing grin reportedly spread across local mother Angela Hopkins' face as she announced to her family that the mashed potatoes had in fact been made using cauliflower as a healthier alternative. "Well, looks like you all really liked the potatoes--did they seem any different than usual?" asked Hopkins, who then admitted with audible delight that she had "tested out" a new recipe. "I'll bet you'd never guess they were made with cauliflower, now would you? Less calories and fat, but they still tasted like the real thing. I actually think I kind of like these ones more than regular mashed potatoes, to be honest." Following the meal, family members reported a sharp sinking feeling as a beaming, wild-eyed Hopkins hovered over their shoulders and encouraged them to enjoy some of the brownies she made.
