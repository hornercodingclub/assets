FAIRFIELD, CT--Heeding warnings that a world-ending cataclysmic event will occur next Friday, local man Craig Massey, 26, who will be one of several thousand fatalities in 2023's Great Eastern Seaboard Flood, told reporters today he is fully prepared for the apocalypse he believes the ancient Mayans predicted. "This is the big one, and I'm not taking any chances," said Massey, who 11 years from now will drown in Hurricane Cindy's thrashing storm surge as his house is demolished and all his possessions are washed away. "The conclusion of the 13th b'ak'tun is upon us. I plan on being prepared." Displaying more concern for the dire predictions of numerologists than the warnings of modern scientists regarding the changes in climate that will eventually lead to his unceremonious death, Massey confirmed he has spent much of the year fortifying his basement to create a bunker capable of withstanding "doomsday-level forces." "I don't know how long I might have to stay down there, so I'm getting plenty of the essentials: water, gas masks, nonperishables, and, due to the very real possibility of a new ice age arriving, warm clothes and blankets," said Massey, who in 2023 will have no time to evacuate before the massive storm forces down his door and fills his lungs with water. "My thinking is, you need to be ready for anything when there's an apocalypse coming." "I also got this," he continued, slamming a loaded M9 Beretta pistol down on the table in front of him. "Whatever's coming at me, it's not getting away without a fight." Massey added that the evidence presented by astronomers indicating that no comet or meteor is currently on a collision course with Earth is "a hoax almost as absurd as global warming."
