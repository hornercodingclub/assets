HOUSTON--During an address Wednesday to the National Association for the Advancement of White People, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney received a lengthy standing ovation from the group of 2,000 Caucasians who had gathered to hear him speak. The NAAWP, a 400-year-old organization with a membership of nearly 8 million whites nationwide, is expected to be firmly in Romney's camp come November. "Thank you, thank you so much," said Romney, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by wave after wave of raucous applause and numerous chants of "We love Mitt!" "I love you, too. Really, this is too much." Romney's reception came in stark contrast to the welcome given to President Barack Obama, who spoke to the NAAWP last Thursday and was loudly booed for saying, "Hello, thanks for having me."
