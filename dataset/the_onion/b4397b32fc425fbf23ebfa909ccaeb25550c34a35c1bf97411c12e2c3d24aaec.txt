NEW ORLEANS--Inspired to donate his time to the people of New Orleans after touring a neighborhood in the troubled Ninth Ward Monday, Saints tight end Jeremy Shockey volunteered to help residents demolish their homes by using a sledgehammer to knock down walls, razing buildings with a bulldozer, or shooting out windows with a nail gun. "No one should have to live anywhere near houses that look like this," Shockey said. "As a new member of this community, I feel it's my duty to keep working until every person in this neighborhood has a house that's been leveled." According to local residents, Shockey has already destroyed three Habitat for Humanity structures, dismantled several United Way projects, and flattened at least a dozen homes rebuilt since 2006.
