SMYRNA, DE--Saying he needed to be transported to a tranquil, untroubled state of calmness pronto, local man Pete McCartin, 29, told reporters Thursday that a fresh-brewed mug of purportedly relaxation-promoting tea had better fucking work. "This shit better soothe the fuck out of me and quick," said McCartin, adding that the box of Hungarian chamomile blossom and lemon myrtle tea was making some pretty lofty promises with its soft light-blue hues and lotus flowers plastered all over the place, so it sure as shit needed to step the fuck up and put his mind at ease. "I need to start feeling utterly blissful and placid as hell. I want all my cares melted away fucking yesterday. If I'm not fully at peace by the time I finish sipping this cup, I'm going to be so goddamn pissed." At press time, a scowling McCartin was steeping a second teabag in his mug in an effort to get the feelings of serenity and quietude to hurry the fuck up.
