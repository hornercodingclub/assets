Liz Cheney, who is running for a Senate seat in Wyoming, recently voiced her opposition to gay marriage, prompting her sister, Mary Cheney, who is married to her same-sex partner, to issue a response on Facebook stating that Liz is "on the wrong side of history." What do think? "If the Cheney sisters switched spouses for a week, I think we'd all learn a little something about love." Andrew Pastorelli * Turbine Assembler "You know how sisters are. One second they're embroiled in a politically charged skirmish before the eyes of a nation, the next they're braiding each other's hair." Pavel Woods * Lettuce Trimmer "They should be talking about real issues that affect Wyoming, like fish and game." Claudia Vaughn * Systems Analyst
