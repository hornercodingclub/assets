ITHACA, NY--Marveling at how different winter is in the Northeast compared to her hometown in Florida, Ithaca College freshman Emilie Sherman told reporters Tuesday that this was the very first time she had ever seen people complain about snow for five consecutive months. "Growing up in Sarasota, of course there was never any incessant whining about snow, so I was completely amazed when I saw that first person go on and on for months on end about how annoying the snow was," said a visibly awestruck Sherman, adding that while she had previously heard how harsh and lengthy the complaints about winter could be in the northern U.S., the amount of ceaseless grumbling she's seen this year went far beyond anything she had ever imagined. "It's remarkable--I just can't believe the bitching continues this long every year. I'm still stunned every time I look around and see all of it." Despite her astonishment, Sherman said she couldn't wait to return home over break and get back to her more familiar year-round gripes about the heat and humidity.
