CLEVELAND--Cavaliers forward LeBron James held a press conference Tuesday to announce that he had begun his annual observance of Basket History Month, urging others to honor the significant contributions baskets have made in their own commemorative way. "Unfortunately, many people today, especially young people, don't realize that if it wasn't for all of the pioneer baskets that came before us, we wouldn't even have the sport of basketball today," James told reporters, suggesting that Americans can learn more about the achievements of baskets by visiting their local library. "The ball gets an awful lot of credit, but without the basket we celebrate all February, there would be no place put the ball." James added that when he was not celebrating the accomplishments of baskets, he would hold numerous moments of silence during this month's games to honor the sacrifices made by baskets that have gone before and to keep their memory alive.
