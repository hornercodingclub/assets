BOSTON--Boston head coach Doc Rivers expressed disappointment Monday in being eliminated in the second round of the NBA playoffs, but deemed the Celtics' four weeks of postseason play to be "plenty." "You never want to go home early, but we aren't exactly doing that," said Rivers, who noted that the Steelers and Phillies spent four weeks winning their respective championships. "Last year it took us 59 days to win the NBA title, which actually seemed too long. A couple of times against the Pistons I forgot what we were even doing. Playing a month's worth of playoffs seems a lot more reasonable." In other news, the Magic have expressed confidence in their ability to beat the Cavaliers over the course of the next two months.
