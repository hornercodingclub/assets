WASHINGTON--Touting his lengthy tenure in the White House and close personal relationships with the president of the United States and first lady, executives at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck announced Monday that once the current administration steps down later this week, the departing Bo Obama will officially join their high-powered K Street lobbying firm. "We're pleased to welcome Bo as an important addition to our organization, where his experience in Washington and familiarity with the West Wing will no doubt enormously benefit our clients," said BHFS president Steven Farber of the 8-year-old Portuguese water dog, who will reportedly command an annual salary in excess of $750,000 and occupy a sizable corner office overlooking his former address at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. "In his time in the Oval Office, he's met heads of government agencies, generals, and influential members of Congress, not to mention dozens of world leaders--that's a truly incomparable level of access. Plus, he's one of the most respected figures in the Beltway." Farber went on to say that Bo was also the most adorable little munchkin ever hired in the history of the firm.
