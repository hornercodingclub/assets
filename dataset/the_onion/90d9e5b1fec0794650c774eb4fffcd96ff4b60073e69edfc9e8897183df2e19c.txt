reported Wednesday that Lennay Kekua, the girlfriend of celebrated Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o who was said to have died of leukemia and inspired Te'o and the Irish during their 12-1 season, was fictional and part of an apparent hoax. What do think? "How far does this thing go? Am I real? Are any of us?" "Ha! I knew those 113 tackles and 7 interceptions were too good to be true." "This sadly makes it tough to root for the upstanding and otherwise incredibly likable Notre Dame football program."
