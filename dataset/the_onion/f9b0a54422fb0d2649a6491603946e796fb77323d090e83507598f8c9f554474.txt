After two fatal tour bus accidents occurred in a single week, authorities in New York conducted random inspections in which 14 of 14 buses stopped were taken taken off the road for safety violations. What do think? "It's a good thing they found all 14 of the bad buses." Evan Blackwell * Cap Maker "You know, it'd be a lot more useful if the state would just release a list of commercial vehicles that unlicensed felons were allowed to operate." Patricia Lordan * Turning Machine Operator "Huh. 'Buses'? That word looks funny, right? I know I'm saying this out loud, but when it's transcribed it'll probably look all weird. Then again, doesn't 'busses' look even weirder? I bet it does." Thomas Marcellino * Malt Roaster
