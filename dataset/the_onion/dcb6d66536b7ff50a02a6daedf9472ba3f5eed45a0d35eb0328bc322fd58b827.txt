Scientist Rogerio Bertani recently discovered nine previously unknown and endangered species of small tree-dwelling tarantulas in Brazil, many of which feature bright pink, purple, and orange colorations.

Yvonne Pedley * Jukebox Coin Collector "And all this time I've been painting my tarantulas like a moron." Charles Brierley * Raspberry Grower
