BROOKLYN, NY--After discovering his mother had failed to pay his phone bill from last month, local resident Cormac Flannigan, 29, reminded her Tuesday to "try to be more careful" and "make a point of remembering to do that going forward," family sources confirmed. "I need my phone, I use it all the time, and I don't want to keep getting these annoying messages saying you haven't paid the bill yet," said Flannigan, speaking into the third iPhone his mother has purchased for him in the past five years. "I'm not mad, Mom, but you need to stay on top of this, okay? I don't want to have to remind you every month." Sources added that Flannigan, who is employed and has not lived with his parents for six years, also told his mother for the fourth time that she needs to upgrade his data plan.
