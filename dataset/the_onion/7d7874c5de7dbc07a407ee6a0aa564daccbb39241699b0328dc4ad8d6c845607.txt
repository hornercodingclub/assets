WASHINGTON--Visibly anxious after bringing his longtime girlfriend to local pub The Bier Baron, area man Noel Johnson reportedly got down on one knee Friday and finally mustered the courage to ask Amanda Spaid whether she was willing to settle for him. "Amanda, will you disregard the vision of an ideal husband you've been building up in your mind since you were a little girl and marry, for whatever reason, me?" Johnson reportedly asked as he produced the only ring he was able to afford on his meager salary as a computer salesman, a job that would likely prevent Spaid from being able to enjoy a level of material comfort that she could have easily attained with one of millions of other potential mates. "Realistically, just based on my mediocre personality, genetic shortcomings, and substandard romantic and sexual abilities, I'm not going to make you the happiest woman in the world. But I guess what I'm asking is: Will you spend the rest of your life with me, a guy who, at this point in time, is probably your most sensible option?" Spaid went on to express surprise upon realizing Johnson was willing to throw away all of his freedom and independence for, of all people, her.
