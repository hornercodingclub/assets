EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ--Though the the Chargers dealt the Giants a crushing fourth consecutive loss Sunday, running back Ahmad Bradshaw admitted in a postgame press conference that, overall, he still had a "pretty great" weekend. "Slept in on Saturday--that was nice--and then that night I made enchiladas with my girlfriend and they came out perfect," said Bradshaw, who failed to break into the secondary on any of his 14 carries during the game. "Game day was beautiful. I watched a couple episodes of [In Philadelphia] in bed, ate a big breakfast, and then I played a football game for money. So all in all, a pretty great weekend aside from letting down all those Giants fans." Bradshaw then briefly discussed his disappointing 39-yard performance but cut the press conference short to go explore New York City with a friend.
