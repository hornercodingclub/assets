PLANO, TX--Inviting consumers to experience their favorite snack product like never before, Frito-Lay announced a new sweepstakes this week that will offer customers the chance to appear inside an upcoming bag of SunChips. "This contest will give one grand prize winner and a guest the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to find out what it's really like in a bag of SunChips," company spokesperson Nancy Alderman said, adding that the prize would also include an all-expenses-paid trip to the snack manufacturer's headquarters, where the winner will receive a behind-the-scenes factory tour and be able to sample new Frito-Lay flavors before spending an exhilarating afternoon packed tightly inside a package of either Original or Harvest Cheddar SunChips. "To enter, all you have to do is fill in your name and email address at SunChips.com and you could soon be sealed in a plastic bag alongside your favorite multigrain chips and distributed to a SunChips retailer." Official rules state that the contest is open to all U.S. residents, excluding the families of Frito-Lay employees and winners of the company's previous "Win a Date with a Bag of Tostitos" contest.
