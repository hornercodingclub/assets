NEW YORK--Welcoming viewers back to an exclusive interview featuring the President's new attorney, Special Counsel Robert Mueller posed as a Fox News host Thursday to coax Rudy Giuliani into giving him a testimony on Trump. "Rudy, it's always a pleasure to have you on 'Mueller Tonight'--now, I wanted to really dig in and ask you about the President's state of mind on April 11, 2017," said Mueller, who leaned over his desk as Giuliani eagerly answered a series of follow-up questions concerning Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, and the Seychelles islands, stressing that the millions tuning in to watch the 8 p.m. primetime Fox News talk show "really appreciated" the former New York City mayor's insight. "Fascinating stuff, Rudy. I'm sure our fans at home are especially interested in that Trump Tower meeting you just mentioned. Before we head to break, though, would you mind putting your hand on this Bible and repeating something for me?" At press time, Mueller had welcomed President Trump, who called in to the show to give a statement confirming everything Giuliani had just said.
