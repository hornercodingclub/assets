GRAND ISLE, LA--Unsure when he would feel such a compulsion again, local man Robert Malbrook told reporters Wednesday that he had no choice but to ride an unexpected urge to clean as far as it will take him. "I could be doing other things, but I have to take advantage of this while I still can," said Malbrook, wiping down the counters of his kitchen and sweeping up the crumbs around the trash can in an impulsive flurry of activity that he was well aware could vanish as quickly as it came. "I want to mop the floors, scrub the stove top, even clean out the refrigerator. I simply can't let this feeling pass. I don't know how far this wave is going to take me, but I'm on board all the way to the very end." At press time, Malbrook had stopped abruptly while washing his bathtub and moments later was watching TV.
