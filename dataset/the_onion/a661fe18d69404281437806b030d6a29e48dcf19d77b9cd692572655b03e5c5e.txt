Socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, who has served for nearly 14 years, was elected to his third six-year term Sunday with 54 percent of the vote, beating out former provincial governor Henrique Capriles Radonski. What do think? "Oh, no, not another six years of Chavez bringing America to its knees!" Vicente Alvarez * Systems Analyst "The Venezuelan people are going to be upset when they learn he's a socialist." Redmond Philpott * Bicycle Messenger "I wouldn't want to be on Capriles' campaign staff right about now. Or Chavez's. What I'm saying is that I hate Venezuela and wouldn't want to have a job that would require me to live there." Myra Greenaway * Window Washer
