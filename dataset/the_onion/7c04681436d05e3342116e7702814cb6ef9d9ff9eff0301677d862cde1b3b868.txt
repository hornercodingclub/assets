WASHINGTON--Claiming that he would "be up Shit Creek without a goddamn paddle" if he wasn't able to locate one, a frantic, out-of-breath Vice President Joe Biden reportedly arrived at a D.C. area canine rescue shelter early Monday morning in search of a look-alike for the Obama family's pet dog Bo. "Hey, I need a poodle, pronto--black one if you got it," the frenzied, disheveled VP told Washington Humane Society workers, emphasizing that he needed to "score a dead ringer" for the First Family's beloved Portuguese Water Dog "before they wise up." "Theirs is a boy, I think, but whatever, can't be picky here. That little nippy one is close enough. Doesn't have to be the genuine article. Uncle Joe's just got to set things right." Sources confirmed Biden also asked the shelter's employees if they offered any "cheap quickie pet cremations."
