SIMSBURY, CT--Marveling at her singular focus and unflinching determination, onlookers reportedly found themselves feeling inspired Tuesday by the passion with which local 3-year-old Ava Matthews demanded a brightly colored helium balloon. "To see someone so impassioned by something that she's literally jumping up and down, balling her hands into fists, and screaming for it--it's incredibly moving and puts into perspective just how much desire has been lacking from my own life," said Jeremy Citterman, 34, adding that the toddler's display of longing was all the more affecting given that her parents had to physically restrain her from simply running up and grabbing the object of her craving. "At this point in my life I can't even imagine anything that badly, let alone getting that worked up about it. I have to say, I'm awestruck." Citterman later admitted, however, that Matthews' pleas would have been more convincing had she not been holding a fairy wand and been absolutely covered in melted ice cream.
