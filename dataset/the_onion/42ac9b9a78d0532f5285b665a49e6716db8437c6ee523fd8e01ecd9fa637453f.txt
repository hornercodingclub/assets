CINCINNATI--On the same day cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones pleaded not guilty to assault charges after being accused of striking a woman outside of a bar, local Bengals fan Randall Price reportedly told his friends Tuesday that he's confident this incident is the wake-up call that Jones needs to turn his troubled career around. "It really seems like he's going to learn his lesson from this arrest," said Price of the troubled NFL star who has now had more than 10 brushes with the law. "I'm pretty confident that this actually winds up being good for him and good for the NFL. It provides an example to the rest of the league that after a lengthy suspension and then a few more incidents, a player can finally go on to have a successful career after just one more arrest." When asked by reporters whether he also saw the off-the-field incident as a wake-up call, Jones made it very clear that he felt "that dumb bitch is lying."
