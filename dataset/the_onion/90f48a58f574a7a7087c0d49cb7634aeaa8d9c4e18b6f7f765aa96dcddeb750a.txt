NEW YORK--Noting that the rampant problem has devastated rosters across the league, representatives from the National Basketball Players Association demanded an increased referee presence in high-foul areas, sources confirmed Friday. "Something has to be done to crack down on all the foul-ridden sections of the court, and the only solution is having more referees out there to combat this issue head-on," said NBPA executive director Michele Roberts, adding that the league must immediately position additional officials in the low post area, which has become a hotspot for personal, technical, and flagrant fouls. "We can't let this situation get any worse than it already is. We've seen too many instances of power forwards and shooting guards getting hacked out there, and there are certain parts of the paint where players are too scared to even drive. It's absolutely unacceptable." Roberts added that the NBA needs to implement a zero-tolerance policy toward repeat offenders who are guilty of committing multiple loose-ball fouls in a single game.
