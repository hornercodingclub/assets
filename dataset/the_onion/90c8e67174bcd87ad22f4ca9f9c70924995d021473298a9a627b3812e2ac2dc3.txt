NEW YORK--Growing visibly emotional as he expressed gratitude to legislators for their boldness and compassion, Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman reunited with his family Thursday following the passage of the First Act criminal justice reform bill. "It's been a long road to release, but I'm ready to put my incarceration behind me and re-enter society thanks to the bipartisan efforts to pass this long-overdue overhaul of America's justice system," said the former leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel as he embraced his wife and children, his voice breaking as he personally thanked President Trump for signing the bill that had resulted in an end to his trial for murder, drug trafficking, and organized crime and allowed for his immediate release from prison. "To know that America is a merciful nation--one willing to give people like me a second chance--fills my heart with so much hope for the future. I will never forget this. Thank you. Thank you all."  At press time, Guzman had departed after telling reporters that he was ready to get back to his regular life and order the murders of many, many people who had crossed him.
