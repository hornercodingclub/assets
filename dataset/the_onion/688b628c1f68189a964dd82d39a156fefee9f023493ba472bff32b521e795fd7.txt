ST. LOUIS--In response to extensive market research, fast food chain Hardee's announced plans Tuesday to equip every table at its restaurants with its all-new "Shame Curtains," large, dark drapes behind which menu items can be consumed in complete privacy. "We asked customers what we could do to improve their dining experience, and they said nothing would be better than finding a way to prevent them from making humiliating public spectacles of themselves as they enjoy Hardee's classics like our two-thirds pound Monster Thickburger," CEO Andrew Pudzer said during a press conference at which he demonstrated how to use the fully opaque, ceiling-to-floor Shame Curtains. "Once the double-Velcro closure is secure, you can consume your meal free from the recriminating glances and disgusted stares of your fellow patrons. And you don't have to worry about feeling embarrassment in front of passersby, either, because we've decided to just go ahead and brick up all the windows." Pending the success of the curtains, Hardee's may experiment with subterranean tunnels that allow its restaurants to be entered from across the street.
