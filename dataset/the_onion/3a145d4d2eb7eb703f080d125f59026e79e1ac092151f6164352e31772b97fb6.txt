BROOKLYN, NY--Her combative reaction seeming to come out of nowhere, local woman Monica Respers on Wednesday was reportedly getting all defensive about her inherent worth and selfhood. "It's like I can't say a single cruel and demeaning thing without her getting touchy about her value as a human being," said boyfriend Brad Larsen, adding that Resper gets "totally bent out of shape" every time he tries to completely discount what she wants to do with her life or clearly demonstrates that his needs are always going to be more important than hers. "Jesus, she's so thin-skinned about constantly being told to be something she's not. Seriously, I make the slightest attempt to diminish her or undermine any pride she may have in her accomplishments, and she just lashes out." At press time, Larsen was reportedly shocked that merely from belittling every opinion and goal she had for the entirety of their relationship, she completely overreacted and broke up with him.
