WASHINGTON--After gently knocking on his brother's door and insisting he really should eat something, Eric Trump left a plate of seared foie gras outside a despondent Donald Trump Jr.'s bedroom door, sources said Wednesday. "Hey, Donny, you sure you don't want a little supper?" said Trump, telling his brother that he might be feeling sad, but that didn't mean he had to go all day on an empty stomach. "It's got pear puree and beluga caviar, too. We know how much you like that. Okay, how about I just leave this right here, and you can have some anytime you get hungry? And, hey, we saved you a blackberry mousse torte. It'll be in the fridge whenever you feel like coming down." Despite insisting he wasn't hungry and wanted to be left alone, Donald Trump Jr. had at press time opened his door halfway, brought the plate into his room, and quietly closed the door behind him.
