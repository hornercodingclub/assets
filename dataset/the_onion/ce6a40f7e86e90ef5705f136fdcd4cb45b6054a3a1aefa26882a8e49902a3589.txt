WASHINGTON--Following the Supreme Court's landmark decision making same-sex marriage legal nationwide, sources confirmed Friday that only 47,000 social justice milestones need to be reached before the U.S. achieves full equality. "This is a watershed moment for civil rights that finally brings the dream of living in an equitable society one tiny fraction of a step closer to reality," said civil rights lawyer Helene Najjar, adding that the country could now turn its attention to closing the income gap, ending racial discrimination in law enforcement, and providing equal educational opportunities for all children, among tens of thousands of other issues. "We have been striving for this victory for decades, and we will continue to fight for a more just society until we have reached all 47,000 human rights milestones that still need to be achieved. This win proves that we are inching toward living in a nation in which we have equal rights for transgender people, people of color, people with disabilities, people living in poverty, women, immigrants, and countless other marginalized groups." Experts confirmed that even with the Supreme Court's ruling, the U.S. would still need to achieve 8,000 more milestones before gays could be considered fully equal.
