WASHINGTON--Citing numerous encouraging projections from their research, the nation's tick scientists confirmed Friday that the summer of 2017 would be the best on record. "All 900 species of tick, regardless of whether they're hard or soft, should plan on enjoying the best summer of their lives thanks to the historically high heat and humidity levels we're seeing in our calculations," said the head tick scientist, a standard eight-legged American dog tick, explaining how the excellent season they're expecting will provide optimal conditions in forest systems worldwide for the hematophagic parasites to lay eggs, metamorphosize, and hide amongst vegetation while waiting to climb onto passing hosts. "Above all others, this year presents ample opportunity for us to bite and possibly transmit diseases to thousands of different birds, humans, and species of livestock. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that we will gorge on a historic amount of blood, while our chances of being crushed or sprayed are at an all-time low." The head tick scientist then urged ticks everywhere to "get on out there" before skittering around some dirt and climbing up a tall blade of grass.
