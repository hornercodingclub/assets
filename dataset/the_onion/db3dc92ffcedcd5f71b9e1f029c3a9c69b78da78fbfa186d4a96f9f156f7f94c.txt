CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA--Acknowledging that her improbable affinity for the actress must come as quite a surprise, University of Virginia sophomore Emily DeLong revealed Wednesday that she has found an unexpected kindred spirit in golden age of Hollywood star Audrey Hepburn. "It may seem like an odd thing to say, but I think my favorite actress might be Audrey Hepburn," said the 19-year-old DeLong, adding that while no one would ever suspect it, she has a poster hanging in her dorm room. "She was so elegant and down to earth all at the same time, and something about her beauty was just timeless, you know? A lot more so than today's celebrities." In another statement coming completely out of left field, DeLong said she had recently bought a vintage film camera and was getting into photography.
