TAMPA, FL--After a brief consultation with new patient Dan Highland, local primary care physician Dr. Harold Schlesinger quickly scribbled down a prescription that will touch off a self-destructive 30-year battle with painkiller addiction, sources confirmed Tuesday. "I gave you a few refills in case the pain lingers," said Schlesinger, casually handing over a slip of paper that effectively set in motion three decades of compulsive abuse of opioids, a torturous cycle of detox and relapse, and a dark, drawn-out period of pain and anguish that will not only consume Highland, but his family members and friends as well. "Let me know if this dosage isn't strong enough, and I'll either bump you up or we'll get you on something new." Schlesinger quickly added that while it's recommended that patients not drink alcohol while on the prescription, in practice Highland should "just use moderation."
