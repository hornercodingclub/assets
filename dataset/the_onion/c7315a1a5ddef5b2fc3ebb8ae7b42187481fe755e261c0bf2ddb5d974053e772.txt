WASHINGTON--A report released Wednesday by the United Nations revealed that the U.S. continues to lead the world with the highest per capita density of Kevins of any nation. "Ranked against the rest of the international community, the United States is far and away the global leader in Kevins, with upwards of 27 Kevins per square mile in most major American urban centers," said lead researcher Gilbert Dujarric, who added that when factoring in the nation's Kevs, the density figure nearly doubles. "There are certainly areas of Australia, the U.K., and Canada where the concentration of Kevins is high, but they all fall well short of the United States' Kevin population across all demographics. And when we look at the benchmark Kevin-to-John ratio, no country comes even remotely close to the staggering .205 figure the U.S. posted in 2013." The report's authors noted with surprise, however, that the United States had surpassed Denmark and risen to second place in Jurgen density.
