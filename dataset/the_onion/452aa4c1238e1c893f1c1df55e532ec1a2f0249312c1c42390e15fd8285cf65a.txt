SOUTH BEND, IN--Multiple sources confirmed Thursday that Notre Dame Professor Geoffrey Morell paused his linguistics lecture to tell the student dressed as the Leprechaun to sit the fuck down. "Johnny, cool it, because you're bothering me and you're bothering the class," said Morell, adding that he was tired of warning him every single week about this type of shit. "I know you do your dumb little song and dance during the games, but right now you're a student, so act like it and just get in your fucking seat. Oh, and when you are out there on Saturdays, everybody thinks you're making a goddamn fool of yourself. You are not a part of the team, you are not even a part of the band, and frankly, I think in 10 years you are going to look back on this and feel like a complete jackass. Open your damn notebook." According to witnesses, Professor Morell also informed the Leprechaun that if he ever again walks into his classroom to find "Football Game This Saturday!" written on one of the blackboards, Morell would not hesitate to fail his ass.
