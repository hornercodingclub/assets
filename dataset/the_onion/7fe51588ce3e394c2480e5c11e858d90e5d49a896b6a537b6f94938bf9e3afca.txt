BOSTON--Suddenly needing to "go take care of something," Boston Red Sox infielder Dustin Pedroia left second base in the care of his 34-year-old buddy Dave Scholl on Sunday. "It's pretty easy. If the ball comes to you, just throw it to the guy standing to your left. He'll know what to do with it," said the departing Pedroia, hastily writing his cell phone number on a piece of paper in case of an emergency. "Sometimes the runner will--nah, never mind, not gonna happen. You'll be fine." Upon returning to his position an hour later, Pedroia was relieved to find the Red Sox were still leading the AL East but found that his cat's water dish had not been refilled.
