Donald Trump's childhood home, a 2,500-square-foot Tudor in Queens, is currently up for auction with a starting bid of $849,000. What do think? "It looks like a charming place to raise an unambitious family of losers." Rod Delling * Systems Analyst "Is the house in good shape?

Brett Haymoor * Unemployed "That's a lot of money, even before the cost of bulldozing it to splinters and salting the earth in its wake." Sue Whitcomb * Credibility Appraiser
