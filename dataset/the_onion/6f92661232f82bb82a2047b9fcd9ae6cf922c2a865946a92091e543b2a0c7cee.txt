WASHINGTON--Stirring the emotions of citizens across the nation with his strong and affecting rhetoric, President Donald Trump outlined a bold vision for the country's next mass protests during his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night. "My fellow citizens, we have an ambitious agenda ahead of us," said the president before laying out a far-reaching plan to establish hundreds of new protests across the country that will draw millions of Americans onto major city thoroughfares and outside state capitol buildings, and more still to march on Washington. "We've already started to realize some of this vision, but, folks, this is just the beginning. We have a long way to go. Things are going to be much different under this administration." Trump cautioned, however, that in order for his dream of immense nationwide protests to reach its full and historic potential, he would need Congress to be on board with his ideas.
