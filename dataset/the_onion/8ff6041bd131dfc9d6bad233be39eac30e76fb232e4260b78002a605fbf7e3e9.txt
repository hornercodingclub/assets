NEW YORK--Saying that late October through mid-April looks to be an incredibly tough stretch for them, league experts said Wednesday that the newly released 2013-14 NBA schedule does not bode well for the Phoenix Suns. "The schedule isn't kind to Phoenix at all--they start off against the Trail Blazers at home, and then there are about 81 games there where they'll face teams that present some pretty tough matchups for them," said analyst Jalen Rose, also highlighting games against the Heat, Spurs, Thunder, Bulls, Rockets, Clippers, Warriors, Celtics, Cavaliers, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Nets, Knicks, 76ers, Magic, Wizards, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Jazz, Lakers, Kings, Bobcats, Raptors, Hawks, and Mavericks as incredibly difficult games for the Suns. "The schedule gets a little easier during the All-Star break, but after that there isn't any let-up." When asked to comment on the schedule, Suns coach Jeff Hornacek said he has circled the team's 41 away games and 41 home games as contests that could pose significant tests.
