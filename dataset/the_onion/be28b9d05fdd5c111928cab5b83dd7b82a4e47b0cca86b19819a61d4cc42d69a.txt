MCALESTER, OK--Saying that he was having difficulty selecting just one item among all the available options up for bidding, local 34-year-old Carl Aldrich expressed his frustration Wednesday while attempting to narrow down the vast selection of Super Bowl rings currently listed on eBay. "I only want to buy one, but there are just so many to choose from," Aldrich told reporters, noting that he was deciding between making an opening bid on various championship rings from the 1980 Oakland Raiders and the 1991 Washington Redskins, as well as more than two dozen from the 1972 Miami Dolphins. "It looks like there are a bunch available from the first Super Bowl--I don't have any of those yet. And I guess I could always buy this one that DSharper42 is selling, but I've got so many from the '09 Saints already." At press time, Aldrich had decided to just bid for two separate Super Bowl rings from the 1985 Chicago Bears, as he could likely win both auctions while still remaining under his budget of $500.
