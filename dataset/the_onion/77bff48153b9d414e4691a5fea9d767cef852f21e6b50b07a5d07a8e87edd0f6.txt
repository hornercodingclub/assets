WASHINGTON--Saying it wouldn't be fair to disrupt their lives after seven years in the same school district, Barack and Michelle Obama this week announced their plans to stay in the White House until their daughters graduate high school. "The girls' whole lives are here, and forcing them to move to a new place and start in at a whole new school just to accommodate our careers doesn't seem right, especially at their ages," the first lady said of her daughters Malia, 17, and Sasha, 14, explaining that while Malia has moved more often than her sister and could likely handle another change, Sasha is more sensitive and would have a harder time leaving the group of friends she's known since the second grade. "Malia graduates next year and Sasha only has four more to go, so we might as well stay right here until they finish up. After that, we'll be empty nesters and can move into someplace smaller. Unless the girls go to college somewhere nearby, in which case we may just stay put." The Obamas also added that, given how reliably it has been working for them, they see no need to get rid of their presidential motorcade and purchase a new vehicle for the foreseeable future.
