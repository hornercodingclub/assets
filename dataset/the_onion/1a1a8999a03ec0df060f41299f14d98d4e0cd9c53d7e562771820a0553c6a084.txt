READING, PA--Struggling to control their urge to gawk at her enormous pair, passersby on Friday reportedly couldn't help but stare at a woman's huge kids. "I don't mean to be rude, but I've never seen a set like those before," said local filing clerk Ted Kilgariff, adding that there was no way not to notice a woman walking around with "a couple of big boys like that."

At press time, Kilgariff was flustered after the woman suddenly looked up and caught him staring.
