TALLAHASSEE, FL--Expressing satisfaction with the unexpected bump in his polling numbers, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush confirmed Monday that he was astonished by how easily his stance on removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Capitol set him apart from the rest of the GOP field. "When I tweeted in support of taking down a widely recognized symbol of racism and white supremacy, I thought I'd fall pretty squarely in line with the other Republican candidates, but fortunately I was wrong," said Bush after competitors in the GOP primary race either refused to voice an opinion to avoid offending voters or suggested that the decision should fall to the state's lawmakers, establishing himself as the most sane member of the field "with pretty much zero effort." "All I had to do was offer a basic sentiment about how they should take down a flag widely considered to represent slavery and horrific racial oppression, and boom--suddenly I'm the only enlightened one in the group. I wish everything was this effortless." Bush reportedly expressed relief that he was able to stand out on the Confederate flag issue and wasn't forced to change his stance on climate change, abortion, taxes, immigration, the economy, foreign policy, budget spending, education reform, or national defense.
