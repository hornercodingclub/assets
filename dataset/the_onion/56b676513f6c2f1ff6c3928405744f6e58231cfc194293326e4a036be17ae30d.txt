NEW YORK--Stressing that the smallest details often help to secure an interview, the MLB Players Association advised the league's remaining free agents Monday to try adding keywords like "baseball" to their resumes. "You're going to want to use words that stand out to recruiters like 'throw' and 'glove'--you can even put value-add words such as 'home run' or 'WAR' in bold to really make them pop," said executive director Tony Clark, adding that players should also customize cover letters by using the names of the GM and coach as well as providing specific details as to why they want to play for a franchise. "Remember, teams are only going to be spending about 10 seconds on each resume, so you really need to grab their attention. You can even stretch the truth a bit--don't go saying you were MVP, because they'll definitely check a claim like that. But for instance, if you batted seventh, you could embellish by claiming you batted in the middle of the order. Or if you were on the White Sox, just say you played in Chicago." Clark also urged free agents to make connections with a team by taking a lower-level position like concessions management or ball boy.
