WASHINGTON--Following pages of subsections that would officially authorize continued airstrikes, rescue operations, and the deployment of U.S. Special Forces in the fight against ISIS, the final line of the military force proposal that President Obama delivered to Congress Wednesday is said to briefly mention the possibility of a 25-year-long quagmire. "There is also a chance that we may become embroiled in a geopolitical nightmare until 2040," reads the last sentence of the draft, immediately beneath a clause repealing the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq and a stipulation that Obama regularly provide Congress with updated reports on the offensive. "And the cost of such an entanglement could amount to several trillion dollars and tens of thousands of lives, too." Legal scholars noted that the proposal's language intentionally leaves the door open for a future president to extend the authorization by one or more generations as necessary.
