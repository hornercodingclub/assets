CINCINNATI, OH--After enduring the arrests of 10 of their players over the last 14 months, the exasperated Cincinnati Bengals coaching staff announced that it will enact a new training-camp rule--the Bengals' third ever--requiring players to at least try and make it back for the 3 a.m. curfew. "I know the guys won't like this," Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said Monday. "But a rule's a rule, as I've often told them, and if they can't get drunk, stoned, or embroiled in a running gun battle with police before the curfew, they will eventually have to suffer the consequences." The team is also considering a radical new policy that would encourage Bengals players who drink heavily to seek the help of a designated driver to take them to practice.
