SAN DIEGO--Noting that the phrase had appeared in large blue letters during each of the team's offensive drives, sources at Qualcomm Stadium confirmed Friday that the Jumbotron was trying really hard to push a new third-down cheer on San Diego Chargers fans. "The phrase 'Let's Go Bolts!' just randomly appeared on the screen while pounding drums played over the loudspeakers--I've been going to Chargers games my entire life, and I've never heard anyone say that once," said 39-year-old spectator Joseph Novello, who estimated that less than 10 percent of the confused crowd joined in on the cheer, most of whom were children. "Each word gets bigger on the screen when you're supposed to yell it, like they're trying to teach us the cheer or something. Honestly, everybody is just doing their best to ignore it at this point." Fans were said to be relieved later in the game when the familiar plea to "Get Charged Up!" finally appeared on the Jumbotron.
