CHICAGO--Explaining that he can sometimes spot raw talent just by looking at someone, Kelvyn Park High School basketball coach Keith Burris told reporters Thursday that he sees something in 7'3" sophomore Adrian Patton. "I can't put my finger on it, but there's definitely something special about that kid," said Burris, who added that where others might see another random 7'3" teenager, he sees a basketball player with a lot of potential. "I think there's a spark in him, and I think he could help us. We'll try him out as a shooter, but I actually have a hunch the low post is where he's going to shine." Upon being invited to try out for the team in the fall, Patton reportedly told Burris that he can't participate in sports due to severe arthritis.
