DETROIT--Months following his record-setting 2012 campaign, Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson shocked football fans Wednesday, revealing that he played much of last season with a severely broken heart. "A certain someone banged up my heart pretty bad, but I wasn't about to let that stop me from doing what had to be done," said the Lions wideout, who last year caught 122 passes for an NFL record 1,964 yards while reportedly suffering from the chronic pain and anguish of having his heart torn out and shattered into a thousand pieces. "Sure, it makes it difficult to perform when you've had your heart trampled on by the one person who told you she would always be there for you. It really hurts, but when a situation like that arises, you just gotta play through it, you know?" At press time, Johnson added, "Lilah. Oh, Lilah, Lilah, Lilah."
