OSN shares its expert analysis on the teams that will come away with victory in this weekend's NFL week eight games: - The game ball will go to Carolina kicker Graham Gano, whose successful extra-point attempt in the second quarter will be the nail in the coffin as the Panthers cruise to a 31-13 win. - The Saints offensive line matches up very well against Mario Williams. - Head coach Andy Reid had the team prepare all week to face either a dreadful or a completely fucking horrendous quarterback. - Once again this is a very bad matchup for the Jaguars as San Francisco is a professional football team. - Dez Bryant proves he can do anything Calvin Johnson can do by putting together an impressive individual performance during his team's loss. - Miami's offensive line will breathe a sigh of relief that they don't have to block Vince Wilfork, but they'll have their hands full not blocking Chandler Jones, Tommy Kelly, Rob Ninkovich, Andre Carter, Dont'a Hightower, and Brandon Spikes. - The Giants will test Michael Vick's hamstring early and often while chasing the mobile quarterback into the end zone. - The Bengals' superior offense, defense, and special teams won't be enough to contend with the Jets' fucking bullshit luck. - Expect the Steelers to get a tough road win in this historical matchup that means absolutely nothing to anyone under the age of 50. - As long as Denver's defense can hold Washington to 54 points or fewer, the Broncos should be fine. - Both teams have had their feathers ruffled this season, but this Bird Bowl will provide a chance to keep their slim playoff hopes flying in the sky, and it looks like the Falcons will sharpen their beaks and find a way to regurgitate food into the mouths of their young all the way to victory. - The Packers are going to need to play hard for all two quarters of this game. - Expect the Seahawks to send a clear message that Monday night games just fucking suck this season.
