SAN ANTONIO--Following the Lakers' 91-79 loss in Game 1 of their playoff series, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan reportedly urged his opponents Tuesday not to be discouraged, reminding them of England's underdog victory against the French during the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. "Remember, the English were outnumbered 6 to 1, so they had the odds stacked against them, too," said Duncan, noting that the Lakers should remain focused and positive, "much like the English knights bravely marching into Pas-de-Calais amidst a bloody Hundred Years' War." "If Henry V taught us anything that day, it's that an organized, cohesive unit can turn around any so-called lost cause, so keep your heads up. Sometimes you simply need to find an innovative new approach, as the King did setting his longbowmen on the flanks of the defile to attack Charles d'Albert's oncoming cavalry." Duncan added that while the Lakers should take heart from England's unexpected military triumph, they should also always honor the memory of the estimated 10,000 soldiers from both sides who gave their lives during the 15th-century battle. Duncan reportedly just called Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni to offer inspirational quotes from famed king and military leader Frederick II of Prussia.
