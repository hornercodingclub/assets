NEW YORK--According to a growing consensus of U.S. poets, shadows--inky sharp as a raven's beak--meet the sullen bloat of clouds, their hues a pallid loam, each a dancer, each alone, like dusty charcoal on an ashen brow. Citing both the ageless gloom of morning and a weary sun, its astral luminescence wrapped in arid gauze, the nation's poets told reporters this week that doubt lingers in the frail minutes of a young dawn, adding that said doubt was a heathen doubt--a father's doubt--untouched by faith.

" (you who call yourselves chaste, adieu) streaming silken love me lines graceless through rough ears, a language unknown, a sound unheard, a thought crying out for new thoughts," poet harrison janie IV told reporters, emphasizing repeatedly that . "is this what is to be made of my ? a christmas wish? a torn dress? a sign that says ' ?' take me as an ideal woman, not your idyll, or take me as an idle man, removed of , removed of hindered fuck, ." While experts believe the nation's poets may make a statement on wisdom's supple strength of skin as early as late July, sources in the poetry community were quick to emphasize FIELDS....these are not                             FIELDS            we speak of, but stores of HOPE.
