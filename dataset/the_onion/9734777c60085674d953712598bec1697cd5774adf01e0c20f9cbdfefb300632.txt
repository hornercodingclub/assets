WASHINGTON--In a symbolic ceremony celebrating the signature legislative achievement of his administration, President Barack Obama personally euthanized terminal cancer patient Shirley Hunnicutt, 73, at George Washington Memorial Hospital Tuesday in what he promised will be the "first of many" physician-assisted suicides performed under the Affordable Care Act as promised. "Okay, that should about do it," said the president as he injected Hunnicutt with a barbiturate followed by a heart-stopping muscle relaxant, holding the woman's hand as she drifted toward a peaceful end. "Shirley is resting easy now, and I'm sure the American people will rest easy knowing my health care reforms will encourage thousands of ill or disabled patients just like Ms. Hunnicutt here to choose death instead of burdening our system with protracted hospice care or rehabilitation. Today was great. I enjoyed this." Obama later confirmed to reporters that, as clearly indicated in section 1233 of his health care reform bill, he hopes to personally kill thousands of senior citizens in the next three years of his presidency.
