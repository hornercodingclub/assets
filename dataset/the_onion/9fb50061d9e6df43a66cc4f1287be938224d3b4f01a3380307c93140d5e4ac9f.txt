BINGHAMTON, NY--In a risky maneuver requiring precise timing and careful preparation, LifeTech Medical Devices employee Trevor Sadler, 32, executed a daring 3:30 p.m. escape from his office Monday afternoon, sources confirmed. "All right, it's go time," Sadler said to himself moments before furtively slipping out of his cubicle and taking a circuitous route to the back stairwell leading out to the parking lot where his car would be waiting. "I'm leaving my monitor on, and there's a full glass of water sitting on my desk so it'll seem like I'm still in the building. And I won't bring my laptop bag with me. That way, if anyone sees me leave, I'll look like I'm just stepping out for a minute. Then I should be home free." At press time, Sadler had been drawn into an unexpected conversation with a coworker about an upcoming sales meeting, forcing the would-be fugitive to hastily snap the man's neck and drag his body into the supply closet.
