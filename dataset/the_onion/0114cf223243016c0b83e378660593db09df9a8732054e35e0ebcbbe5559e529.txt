CINCINNATI--Overwhelmed by a wave of fatigue, local man Will Markowski told reporters Tuesday that he was uncertain whether he was getting sick or if it was just the end of a normal workday. "I have no idea if this exhaustion I'm feeling means I'm coming down with something or if I'm just getting back from the office," said Markowski, who noticed his body becoming achy throughout the day either from contracting an illness or the effects of his regular Monday-through-Friday routine. "I'm completely drained and lightheaded. I feel like this every day when I leave work, of course, but that doesn't mean I'm not also coming down with something. Whatever it is, I really need to lie down." At press time, Markowski was waking up to nausea and a headache that either meant he was getting sicker or merely that he remembered the stack of paperwork waiting for him.
