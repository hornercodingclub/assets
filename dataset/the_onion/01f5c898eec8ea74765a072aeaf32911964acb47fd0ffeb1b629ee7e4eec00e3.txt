NEW YORK-- film critic Joel Siegel, confident that he will be "knocked out by 90 minutes of wall-to-wall, non-stop laughs," preemptively raved Monday about , due in theaters Feb. 6. "I'm going to love it!" said Siegel, who plans to see an advance screening of the film Saturday. "This movie will be loaded with side-splitting humor, pulse-pounding car chases, and toe-tapping, sing-along musical numbers. I'm going to want to see it over and over!" According to Siegel, , which stars Dan Aykroyd and John Goodman, will be even funnier than the original. "Aykroyd and Goodman will be pure dynamite together," he said. "I never thought I'd say this, but will outshine even the first movie!" Film critic Jeff Craig of , who plans to see the film Sunday, agreed. "Joel is right: This movie is going to be hysterical!" he said. Siegel said concerns that the new film would be a cheap "cash-in" sequel will be proven wrong by the anything-goes spirit that will imbue the entire film. Siegel said he is also looking forward to the film's slew of cameo appearances, which include Paul Shaffer, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. "I'm not going to know who'll turn up next!" he said. Siegel, who has ranked the film sixth in his 1998 year-end 10-best list, concluded his review by saying: "This film will have audiences rocking and rolling long past the year 2000. I for one will hope it's not the last we've seen of the saga." Siegel also offered critical raves to Wes Craven's --which has yet to be written or cast--calling it "hair-raising, clever fun. See it as soon as it exists!"
