MIAMI--Surreptitiously grabbing the explosive device stashed inside her lectern and pulling its pin as soon as she heard moderator Jorge Ramos mention her support for the Iraq War and the Wall Street bailout, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly threw a flash grenade onto the stage during Wednesday night's Democratic debate to divert attention away from a question about her Senate voting record. "That's an important question, Jorge, and one I'm happy to answer," said the former secretary of state just as the military-grade M84 stun grenade exploded, emitting a deafening blast and blinding flash of white light that prevented anything on stage from being seen or heard for the duration of Clinton's answer. After cowering with their hands over their ringing ears for approximately 70 seconds, rattled audience members, the debate's moderators, and fellow candidate Bernie Sanders were said to have regained their vision and hearing just in time to make out the final sentence of Clinton's response: "And that's why I've always stood on the side of the middle class and working families." At press time, a misty white gas was seen pouring from the base of Clinton's podium toward the moderators' desk as Ramos cited Clinton's changing positions on gay marriage, the Keystone XL pipeline, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
