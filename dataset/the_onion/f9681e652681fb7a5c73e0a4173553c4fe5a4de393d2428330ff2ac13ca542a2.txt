SAN JACINTO, CA--Despite local married couple Jim and Nancy McFadden's recent decision to seek new romantic partners while still staying together, sources reported Monday that the rest of the world's population is not exactly jumping at the chance to partake in the open relationship. "No thanks, we're good," 7.1 billion global inhabitants of every age, race, and sexual orientation reportedly said to the husband and wife of four years following word of their new romantic arrangement. "We understand the offer's out there but, yeah, we're just going to take a pass on this one." According to reports, a few thousand international citizens were momentarily rethinking the proposition, before reading the couple's respective Craigslist ads and saying "Nah."
