NEW YORK-- 's Peter King published his lengthy preview of Super Bowl XLVII Sunday, drawing particular attention from readers in large part due to nearly 50 mentions of a terrible stay at a Courtyard Marriott littered throughout the piece. "Taking advantage of the extra week's rest will be crucial for injured 49ers end Justin Smith--nearly as crucial as it was for me the night before covering two conference championship games in one day, but Lord knows I couldn't string together more than two consecutive hours of sleep with those paper-thin dividers the Courtyard tries to pass off as walls," King wrote in the championship preview he broke into six parts: offense, defense, special teams, good luck getting any goddamn hot water, coaching, and intangibles. "There are still a number of questions that need to be answered by 49ers offense and the manager of that sad excuse for a hotel, namely, can they move the ball through the air if the running game is contained and how exactly can you get away with calling something a breakfast when the waffle maker is broken and you're all out of eggs?" After explaining in detail that giving attitude is a surefire way for bellhops to never earn a tip, King concluded the preview by predicting that the Ravens will win a tight, low scoring matchup and he won't be setting foot in any Marriott-operated hotel unless "some major Rewards points get sent my way soon."
