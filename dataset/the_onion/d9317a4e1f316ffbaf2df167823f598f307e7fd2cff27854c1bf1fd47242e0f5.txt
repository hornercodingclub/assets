LOS ANGELES--Honoring the esteemed actor's many decades in the film industry with drinks and light appetizers, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reportedly held a small farewell gathering in the Dolby Theatre kitchen Friday to celebrate the retirement of Daniel Day-Lewis. "I started working with Daniel about 25 years ago--man, that makes me feel old!" said director Martin Scorsese, causing partygoers--including Helena Bonham Carter, Paul Thomas Anderson, and a costume designer from 1996's --to chuckle as they snacked on chips and salsa, a platter of veggies with ranch dip, and Domino's pizza provided by the Academy. "Back in those early days, I don't think he had any idea what he was getting himself into. But my God, look at him now. How things have changed. I'm sure I speak for a lot of people here when I say, Danny boy, we're gonna miss you, buddy!" Attendees confirmed a smiling Day-Lewis helped distribute slices from a sheet cake that read "Happy Retirement, Dan!" and shared his personal email with those present, encouraging everyone to stay in touch.
