Police in Possagno, Italy say they have identified an Austrian man who accidentally broke three toes off a plaster model used by Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova while posing on the artwork for a photo, though the local court is still deciding whether to press charges.

Ken MacBain * Confectionery Professor "I mean, the statue couldn't have been that good if a simple Austrian could break it." Erin Chaney * Cat Grooming Scheduler
