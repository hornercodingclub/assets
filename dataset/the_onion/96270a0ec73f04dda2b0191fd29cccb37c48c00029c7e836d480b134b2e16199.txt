DALLAS--During last Wednesday's game against the Phoenix Suns, Mavericks center Dirk Nowitzki reportedly told teammates that he "needed a sec" after a possession featuring quick-paced perimeter passing made him nauseous. "Oh jeez, I think I'm gonna throw up," said the nine-time all-star, who, using the team's second time-out, headed to the sidelines, where he dry-heaved between slow, small sips of Gatorade. "I think I should be okay. Just give me some room." Minutes later, Nowitzki ran into the locker room with his hand covering his mouth after a Jason Terry no-look pass to Shawn Marion.
