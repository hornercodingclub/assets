TAMPA, FL--According to sources on the floor of the Republican National Convention, former Florida governor Jeb Bush made his way through the crowd Wednesday afternoon to spread the word about a bad batch of Cialis that some guys were trying to sell out in the parking lot. "Don't waste your money on any of that stuff they're hawking out there," said Bush, who reportedly took John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and Newt Gingrich aside to emphasize that the pills were "really weak shit." "You get your hopes up. You think, 'Wow, $35 Cialis?' But it's bunk. If you want the good stuff, you gotta pay for it." At press time, Bush was again making the rounds to inform everyone the Levitra he had acquired from a guy backstage had turned out to be "absolutely primo."
