LOS ANGELES--Saying their once-beloved viewers have lost much of their luster in recent years, showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff acknowledged Friday they have been frustrated with the way fans of the HBO series have declined in quality over the past few seasons. "During the show's first couple of years, our viewers showed a lot of promise and challenged our assumptions about what a fan base could be," Benioff told reporters, lamenting the fact that when moved past George R.R. Martin's original source material, the show's supporters began to lose coherence and now barely resemble the industry-defining audience they once were. "At this point, however, they've become a tired cliche. It's hard to watch them lose everything that made us love them in the first place. Nothing they do makes any sense anymore, and it just seems like they want the show to be over with as quickly as possible. It's pretty sad, to be honest." At press time, Benioff and Weiss expressed regret that they failed to do more to prevent the fans from becoming so unbelievably shitty.
