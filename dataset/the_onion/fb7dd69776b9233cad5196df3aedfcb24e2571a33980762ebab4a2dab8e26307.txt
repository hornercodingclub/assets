PORTLAND, ME--Friends of area man Nick Overbeck confirmed today that the 26-year-old's mother has been absolutely ripping it up on Facebook over the past four hours and shows no signs of slowing down. "Man, look at her go--she's friending people left and right and just liking the shit out of everything she sees," said friend Alan Gerard, noting that Nick's mom had left a "pretty insane" string of comments on other people's statuses over the previous 90 minutes. "And she's going absolutely balls to the wall posting family photos and scam alerts. Christ, she's really going for it, isn't she?" At press time, sources confirmed that Nick's mother had learned how to use the chat feature and was carrying on six simultaneous conversations like a goddamn madman.
