VATICAN CITY--Following Pope Benedict XVI's announcement that he will resign the papacy at the end of the month, a group of cardinals reportedly hosted a going-away party for the pontiff at his favorite Vatican City dive bar, The Empty Chalice, on Thursday night. "Ratzy's had a wild ride for the past eight years, and me and the guys figured there was no better way to send him off in style than a night out at the Chalice," a visibly intoxicated Cardinal Bishop Angelo Sodano said of the celebration at the dingy, no-frills watering hole, which sources said is renowned for its EUR2 shot specials and is reportedly "stumbling distance" from the 85-year-old pontiff's private quarters at the Apostolic Palace. "This is our usual after-work spot and we've had a lot of rowdy times here, so tonight might get a little out of control. Hey, they don't call this place 'Puke-arist' for nothing!" At press time, Benedict and his archdiocese heads had reportedly been ejected from the bar for harassing a group of young boys at the other end of the bar.
