AUSTIN, TX--Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong kicked off a campaign to restore his image Monday by admitting in a television interview with Oprah Winfrey that he used a sophisticated cocktail of performance-enhancing drugs to evince remorse and shame. "To make the kind of heartfelt apology I am making now without the help of drugs would be impossible, and so when it came to convincing millions of people that I am a decent human being who is capable of actual regret, I needed an edge," Armstrong reportedly says in the extensive television interview, which sources said the cyclist prepared for by injecting himself with stamina-supporting recombinant erythropoietin and methocarbamol, a muscle relaxant that helps to slacken the Depressor anguli oris, Corrugator supercilii and other facial muscles required to frown and cry. "Make no mistake, it still takes a of skill to do what I am doing right now. Saying sorry over and over, all the while maintaining a veneer of humility when you're actually a self-righteous egomaniac? Drugs or no drugs, that's impressive." According to sources, Armstrong then looks directly into the camera with tear-filled eyes and says, "I am so, so sorry."
