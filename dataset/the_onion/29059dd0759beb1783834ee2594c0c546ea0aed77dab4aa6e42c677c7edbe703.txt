TAMPA, FL--In an effort to better gauge the competition, scouts for the Democratic Party headed to the Republican National Convention in Tampa this week to size up GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney. "We've seen him on tape, so we already know he's got great speaking mechanics and a dominant gesturing arm," said lead scout Karl Ponias, 68, noting that Romney has been known to "bring some serious heat" during debates. "At 6-foot-2, and with a 6-foot-3 wingspan, Romney has a body built for campaigning. Combine that with a solid stance behind the podium, and you definitely have a politician who can speak with power. And quickness? The guy can make upwards of four rhetorical points in 45 seconds. No doubt about it, he's a five-tool candidate." According to scouts in both parties, if Romney has any weakness in his political game, it's mental, because when it comes to the issues he often doesn't know where he stands.
