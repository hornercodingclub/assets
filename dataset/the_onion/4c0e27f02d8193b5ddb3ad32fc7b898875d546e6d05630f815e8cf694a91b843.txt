TAMPA, FL--Holding his tongue out while standing several inches away from the device, Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips reportedly spent most of Sunday's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in front of the team's sideline mist machine with his mouth open. "Mmm, that hits the spot," said Phillips, who at one point stopped several defensive players from sitting down in front of the machine, saying that he was "not done drinking yet." "I always get really thirsty during games, so this is perfect. Can you believe they give us all this tasty air water for free?" At press time, Phillips was shuffling side to side in order to follow the stream of mist as the machine oscillated.
