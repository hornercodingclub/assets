SAN JOSE, CA--Counting down the minutes until she could finally kick back and relax, local woman Courtney Porter told reporters Monday that she couldn't wait to get home and take off her uncomfortable persona. "I hate having to put this thing on in the morning and keep it on all day long--the second I walk through my front door, off it goes," said Porter, adding that she looked forward to being able to finally unwind once she shed the constricting personality traits she dons for work. "It's irritating, it barely fits me, and I have to throw on the same one every single day. I only do it because everyone else at my office does." At press time, Porter could be seen easing into a well-worn and casual identity she would never dare leave the house in.
