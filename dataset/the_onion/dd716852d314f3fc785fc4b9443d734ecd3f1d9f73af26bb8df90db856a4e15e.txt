SAN ANTONIO--After entering into divorce proceedings with his wife of nearly 12 years, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan made his considerable abundance of legal knowledge freely available to his spouse's divorce lawyer, sources confirmed Wednesday. "You're an excellent counselor, and you've been doing a bang-up job with these filings so far, but if you ever need any assistance, I'd be more than happy to help," Duncan reportedly told attorney Adam Whitley, noting that certain issues pertaining to alimony, financial disclosure, and joint custody agreements can often be "a little tricky." "Especially when you get into those complex Texas statutes surrounding the proper division of assets and debt, it never hurts to have a second pair of eyes to go over the paperwork. And, by the way, if you haven't already checked it out, is an indispensable resource as far as dissolution law goes. I can lend you my copy if you're interested." Duncan added that should Whitley have any further questions regarding the legal proceedings accompanying the end of his marriage, he should feel free to call him at any point during the Spurs' upcoming championship series.
