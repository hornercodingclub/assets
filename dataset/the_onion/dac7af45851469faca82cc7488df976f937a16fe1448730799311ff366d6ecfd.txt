Dating back to 1903, the World Series is a long and storied championship unlike any other in professional sports. As either the Los Angeles Dodgers or Tampa Bay Rays prepare to enter the history books,  looks back at the greatest teams in World Series history. 2 / 14 : A rousing lineup that went on to become the first of 45 illegitimate World Series Champions. 3 / 14 : Played in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the scrappy Diamondbacks helped heal the nation by making it okay to hate New York again. 4 / 14 : They won 97 games, so just imagine how much better they would have been if Sandy Koufax didn't take time off for that Jewish stuff. 5 / 14 : Despite losing the 2000 'Subway Series' 4-1, the Mets ended up defeating the Yankees after the results were overturned in a landmark 5-4 Supreme Court case. 6 / 14 : In a historic individual performance, Madison Bumgarner nearly single-handedly carried his team to victory, allowing 1 run over 21 innings, going 14 for 22 at the plate with 4 HR, and negotiating a trade deadline deal to acquire Jake Peavy from the Red Sox. 7 / 14 Must be good given grandpa won't shut the fuck up about them. 8 / 14 : Look, if we didn't include at least one Boston team, we knew we were never gonna hear the end of it from all the fucking Mikeys and Donnys out there.
