BROOKLINE, MA--According to friends and neighbors, local resident Robert Orr has repeatedly mentioned in casual conversation that he has been enshrined in the National Hockey League's Hall of Fame. "Rob's such a joker--he's always saying silly things about how he used to be this famous hockey player and how he scored all these goals and things," said neighbor Maureen Norris, who has known Orr since he was 18 and remembers him as a "hard-working boy" who used to travel out-of-state a lot for business before evidently taking early retirement. "Sometimes it's like he really believes all that baloney, though, so I usually just play along." Those closer to Orr, including his wife and two sons, became concerned about his mental health, however, when he started taking them to the annual NHL Hall of Fame induction ceremonies and pretending to know everyone in attendance.
