UPPER DARBY, PA--In a shameless attempt to persuade colleagues to excuse her incompetent mistake, local account supervisor Casey Collins, who forgot to include an email attachment earlier today, apparently expected her coworkers to forgive her just like that, shocked sources confirmed. "She thinks she can carelessly leave out the document, follow up with the line 'Sorry guys, here it is!' and expect us to straight up forgive her? Unbelievable," said coworker Marc Graham, glaring at the audacious message, which reportedly concluded with "my bad" in a final, desperate attempt to atone for the egregious error. "She's lucky she remembered to attach the file so quickly afterward, but if she thinks that wiped the slate clean, then she is sorely mistaken. Maybe a few months from now, but just a couple minutes after she did something like this? No way." At press time, sources confirmed that a number of seething colleagues had slammed their laptops shut and stormed out of the office to collect themselves.
