DENVER--Noting that some discomfort should be expected while traveling to a faraway place in just a few goddamn hours, officials from ultra-low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines reportedly told customers Thursday to just fucking deal with it. "I get that you're cramped and miserable, but if you just shut the hell up and sit there for a few goddamn hours, you'll soon be at your destination," said CEO Barry L. Biffle, urging passengers to suck it up and quit whining so the flight could get on its merry fucking way. "Who gives a shit if you have no leg room and the seats are stiff? Soon you'll be 800 miles from where you are now, and it'll be like the last two hours of your life never even fucking happened. You're the ones who wanted to save $150, so you're welcome, assholes." Biffle added that he didn't want to hear any bitching and moaning about wanting in-flight food options, because everyone can just stuff their stupid faces when they land.
