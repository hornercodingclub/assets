WASHINGTON--Republican strategists confirmed Friday there are now only four songs in the entirety of recorded music that GOP candidates are legally permitted to use. "Currently, the only artists who have not issued court injunctions against Republicans for playing a song on the campaign trail are Kid Rock and Barry Manilow," said John Brabender, a senior strategist for Rick Santorum, adding that he "wouldn't be surprised" if Manilow's lawyer already has a cease-and-desist letter in the mail concerning use of "Ready To Take A Chance Again." "The only options left are in the public domain. So it's looking more and more likely that the Santorum campaign will make 'Turkey In The Straw' the official anthem of its White House run." According to sources, Mitt Romney took the stage during a Wisconsin campaign event Thursday with "Jimmy Crack Corn" blaring from gymnasium speakers.
