WASHINGTON--Saying that it looked great and they'd been wanting something like that, the nation's consumers announced plans Wednesday to get one of those. "Oh, yeah, I've definitely got to go pick one of those up," said Jason Munro of Manitowoc, WI, who echoed the sentiments of tens of millions of his fellow consumers by adding that he'd been hearing a lot of good stuff about it for a while. "I'm sure I could get one around here, but I could probably get a better deal online." After receiving it, the populace reported that it works pretty good and that you should definitely get one.
