WESTON, CT--Visibly shocked and repulsed by her own behavior as she sat questioning the type of person she is deep down, unsettled 2-year-old Ellie Ritter admitted to reporters that she had no idea what compelled her to bite her friend on the face Thursday. "I honestly don't know what came over me. I know Jacob took the train I was playing with, but I usually handle that kind of thing okay--but this time I...I him," said a shaken and bewildered Ritter, sitting wide-eyed on a floor mat at her daycare as she vehemently asserted that she had no prior knowledge of this dark, disturbing place within her. "I mean, this is Jacob we're talking about. He's my friend, my playmate. And I just went straight for his forehead like an animal. Jesus, what is wrong with me?" At press time, the unnerved toddler was staring uneasily down at her trembling, fingerpaint-covered hands and contemplating what other horrors she was capable of.
