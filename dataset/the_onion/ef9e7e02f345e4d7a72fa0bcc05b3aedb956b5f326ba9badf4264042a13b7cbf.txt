WASHINGTON--Grinning proudly as blood gushed from his victim's windpipe, House Speaker Paul Ryan reportedly slit an auto mechanic's throat Wednesday to kick off the GOP purge of the working class. "With our tax reform bill giving us the mandate we have long desired, there's nothing stopping us now--commence the bloodletting!" said Ryan, holding up the lifeless body of the local blue-collar worker as blood from his severed arteries sprayed reporters gathered at the press conference. "Now we can finally experience the sweet release of all our pent-up hatred of the parasitic working class without fear of punishment or retribution. The blood of the filthy proletariat will flow in the streets, and the families of truck drivers, nurses, and retail employees all over the nation will know our wrath. No one making under $50,000 a year is safe. Today, the American economy will be put back on the right track, and the liquidation begins!" At press time, blood-drenched Republican senators Bob Corker and Lisa Murkowski were seen sprinting into a Baltimore Walmart wielding machetes.
