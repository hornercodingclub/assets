ANN ARBOR, MI--Coaches and players reacted philosophically Tuesday to the news that Michigan, which fell out of the polls' Top 25 following their loss to Appalachian State, is now ranked in Division III after a disastrous defeat at the hands of Oregon. "Naturally, I disagree with the voters, but as long as we're here, I think we owe it to our fans to try and make it to the [Div. III championship] Stagg Bowl at the end of the year," said Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr, who has led Michigan to four straight losses and their first 0-2 home season start since 1959. "I just hope the voters in this division's poll keep an open mind and take our strength of schedule into account." Michigan is currently ranked seventh in Division III football, ahead of fan-favorite Wesley but behind perennial powerhouse UW-LaCrosse.
