SAN MARCOS, CA--Issuing a flurry of apologies, equivocations, and statements downplaying her intelligence, local 28-year-old Jessica Knoll reportedly launched into a four-minute self-deprecating preamble Tuesday before sharing her thoughts with a group of colleagues. "I'm clearly not an expert here, and you all are certainly more informed about the issue than I am," said Knoll, deferring to the others in attendance before segueing into a 45-second-long explanation of why she "may very well not have a good handle on these things." "I mean, I have a general sense of what the problem is--and Keith, maybe you can clarify it for me--but really, this is pretty much just a guess on my part." After finally voicing her opinion, Knoll reportedly backtracked immediately when a coworker questioned part of her statement, causing her to look downward while nodding her head and saying "sure."
