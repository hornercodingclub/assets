DALLAS--Cowboys coach Wade Phillips enthusiastically announced Tuesday that he could not wait for the 2009 NFL Giraffe on Apr. 25 and 26, mentioning several times that the animal's neck was his favorite part. "If it takes two whole days for a giraffe, you know that giraffe is a tall one," said Phillips, adding that giraffes were better than free agency because they subsist on twigs and leaves, which do not cost very much money. "When you're rebuilding a team, it's much better to use the giraffe because you can reach really high places with it." Phillips said he has been preparing for the 2009 NFL Giraffe by drawing pictures, collecting "yummy" vegetation, and ladder shopping.
