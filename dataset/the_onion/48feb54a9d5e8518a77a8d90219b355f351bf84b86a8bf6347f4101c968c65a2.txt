BOSTON--According to family sources, 35-year-old defense attorney Mark Chaote received a call from his mother Thursday asking him to include his younger brother Jeremy, 28, in his next murder trial. "You know, your brother really looks up to you, and it would mean a lot to Jeremy if you just let him sit with you at the [defense counsel's] table and look through some evidence," said the concerned mother, adding that it would "make [her] really happy" if Chaote allowed his sibling to grill a few witnesses. "I bet if you asked ahead of time, you could even get him on the jury. If not, it would be nice if you could at least put him on the witness stand for a few minutes so he feels like he's participating." Reports confirmed Chaote later received a follow-up e-mail from his mother stating that unless she hears otherwise, she plans to drop Jeremy off at the courthouse early Friday morning.
