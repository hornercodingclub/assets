WASHINGTON--Host President Obama and special guest Ed Begley, Jr. hunkered down in the Oval Office with a phone bank full of Cabinet member volunteers Friday for the final day of the annual presidential radio address pledge drive. "We've been saying it all week, folks: The deployment of more troops to Afghanistan, the spending of billions to bail out the banks, the podcast--these things you've come to depend on from this weekly address do not pay for themselves," Obama said as he loosened his tie and sipped from a coffee mug. "It's never too late to show your commitment to the United States by donating at the hundred-million-dollar level, and as our thanks, we'll send you a stylish presidential radio address messenger bag. Remember, we get our support from listeners and incredibly wealthy taxpayers like you." A Republican-response pledge drive will reportedly kick off Monday, as the GOP tries to raise enough donations to permanently shut down NPR.
