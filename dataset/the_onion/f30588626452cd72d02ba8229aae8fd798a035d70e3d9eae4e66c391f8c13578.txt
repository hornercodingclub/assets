CHICAGO--Saying that he alone could determine the legitimacy the woman's claim, area man Luke Haggerty will be the judge of whether coworker Delia Carroll is actually a true baseball fan, sources confirmed Wednesday. "She says she's a huge baseball fan, but we'll just see about that," said Haggerty, peppering the woman with seemingly innocuous questions about the current National League standings and her thoughts on recent trades in order to covertly ascertain the true scope of her expertise. "Hey, where's your favorite place to sit in Wrigley? Know who's pitching tonight? Who are some of your favorite players from the '90s?" At press time, Haggerty grudgingly deemed the woman a true baseball fan, but emphasized she'd never be the fan he was.
