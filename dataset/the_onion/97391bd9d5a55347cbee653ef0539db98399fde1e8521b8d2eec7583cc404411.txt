JUPITER, FL--Florida Marlins hitting coach Jim Presley massaged his temples with his left hand and emitted a deep, sorrowful sigh Friday when he realized he would have to spend two hours going over bunting with his team's pitchers. "All right, let's just get this over with," said Presley, who spent much of the practice shaking his head in disbelief and wincing from frustration. "How is it that you're all professional baseball players, but you don't know how to do this? Move up in the batter's box and square yourself off. And make sure you thumb is out--oh, boy. You're going to have to get that checked out." Presley was reportedly in high spirits afterward when he watched infield coach Joey Espada work with the pitchers on throwing to first base.
