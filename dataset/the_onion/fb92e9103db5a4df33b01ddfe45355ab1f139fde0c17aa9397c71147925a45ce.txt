NEW YORK--Taking a moment from their morning broadcast to castigate Cesar Soyec, the man accused with mailing out explosives to numerous prominent Democrats and Trump critics, hosts denounced the bombing suspect Monday as an overenthusiastic fan whose heart was basically in the right place. "This senseless act of attempted violence is a disturbing example of a super-fan getting a little too worked up and going a bit overboard," said co-host Brian Kilmeade, describing Soyec as a "decent-seeming guy" whose "understandable exuberance appears to have gotten the better of him." "We condemn this man's heinous actions in the strongest possible terms, while applauding his can-do attitude, innovative spirit, and commitment to getting involved in the country's political process. Of course, wide-scale assassination attempts are never acceptable, and it's a real shame that a pretty awesome dude wasn't able to pump the brake s slightly more." Kilmeade urged viewers to take Soyec's zealousness as an inspiration, but warned them to "dial it down a smidge."
