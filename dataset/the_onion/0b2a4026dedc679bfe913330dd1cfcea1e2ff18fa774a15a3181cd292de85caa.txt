INDIANAPOLIS--The NCAA Board of Governors announced Monday that it would be abandoning the complicated BCS formula, with its interdependent network of media and coaches polls and computer rankings, in favor of a more streamlined and manageable system consisting of millions of arguments among fans. "We feel that by monitoring opinions expressed during football-related arguments held in the nation's bars, restaurants, lunchrooms, Internet message boards, and dinner tables, we can amass all the data we need to rank the nation's college football teams throughout the season," NCAA president Myles Brand said in a press release detailing the argument-monitoring system already in place at most Division I colleges. "The best thing about this system is that arguments about the accuracy of the previous week's arguments are automatically factored in to each week's rankings. We feel we've finally found the solution fans have been demanding for years." Detractors of the new system claim it will reward larger schools with more vocal, more strident, and simply louder fans, as a recent test of the system had Texas, Michigan, Ohio State, Tennessee, Florida State, USC, Boston College, and Alabama all tied for first place.
