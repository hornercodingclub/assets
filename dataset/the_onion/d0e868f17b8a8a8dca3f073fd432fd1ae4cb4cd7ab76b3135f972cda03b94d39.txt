WINDSOR, ENGLAND--Attempting to keep his past in the past while setting up a shot of newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, royal wedding photographer Geoff Kelly was unable to completely suppress his guilt over the 1997 incident in which he ran Princess Diana off the road in Paris' Pont de l'Alma tunnel, killing the Princess, her companion Dodi Fayed, and their driver. "I don't think the Royal Family recognizes me, but I don't think I'm imagining the awkwardness in here," said Kelly, simultaneously requesting that Harry take a half step to the left and vividly recalling the relentless pursuit of his mother's limousine through the streets of Paris, as well as the Mercedes' sickening impact on the concrete column during the harsh bursts of his camera's flash. "I have to keep telling myself it's been 21 years now. It's most likely just water under the bridge. Either way, one thing that hasn't changed is that I'm still a professional--I put my feelings aside, show up, snap some photos, and move on to the next gig." Kelly concluded the session soon afterwards upon overhearing Prince Harry remark that he looked rather familiar.
