NEW YORK--Saying that he only vaguely remembers the historic game, former MLB umpire Jim Quick admitted Monday to calling a no-hitter during a 1980 matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants while high on the hallucinogenic drug LSD. "I took a couple tabs of acid in the afternoon because I forgot I was umping that night, so by the time I got to the stadium I was already tripping pretty hard," Quick told reporters, adding that although he did his best to act normally while standing behind home plate, the rest of his officiating crew could tell he was under the influence of either drugs or alcohol. "Honestly, the pitcher, batter, and catcher just looked like giant blurs out there, and the strike zone kept moving around in front of my eyes. Even so, I somehow kept calling strikeout after strikeout after strikeout. It was exhilarating, but by the time I called the final out of the ninth inning, I couldn't tell the difference between a fastball through the middle and a slider low and outside." Quick went on to lament that his performance did not result in a perfect game, as he also called eight walks in the contest.
