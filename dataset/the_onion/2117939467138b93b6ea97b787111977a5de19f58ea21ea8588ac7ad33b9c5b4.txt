LAKE FOREST, IL--Exhilarated by the atmosphere of sheer madcap anarchy created by the subtle variations in their visual acuity, a group of friends trying on each others' glasses Friday reveled in the glorious mayhem of their somewhat different prescriptions. "Whoa! Everything is super blurry!" said Katherine Grant, 27, evidently transported with unfettered glee to the fairy tale world of a friend with a minor astigmatism in her right eye. "Oh, these ones of Sandy's kind of make my head hurt. Hmm, Chris, are those bifocals? That's just insane!" After returning the glasses to their respective owners, the friends found themself marooned on the bitter shores of comeuppance by the harsh, unforgiving tide of getting a few smudges on their lenses.
