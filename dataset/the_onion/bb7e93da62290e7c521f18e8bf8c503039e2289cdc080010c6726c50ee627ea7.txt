EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ--Caroming wildly around the locker room following the Super Bowl on Sunday, a panicked Marshawn Lynch reportedly informed teammates that he couldn't figure out how to deactivate Beast Mode. "Help me, help me!" said the Seattle Seahawks running back as he stiff-armed head coach Pete Carroll and hurtled recklessly out of a stadium exit and into the parking lot. "Please, anyone, call the police! I don't know what's happening! This is beyond my control!" At press time, witnesses confirmed Lynch was sprinting at full speed eastward on I-95, with authorities confident that he would lose steam once he hit the Atlantic Ocean.
