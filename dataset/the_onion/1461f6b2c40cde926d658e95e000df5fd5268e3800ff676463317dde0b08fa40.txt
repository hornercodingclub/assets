WASHINGTON--Speaking at a hastily called White House press conference Friday, a visibly tense and perspiring President Barack Obama confessed that the United States' fleet of roughly 700 armed drones have been conducting airstrikes entirely on their own for the past several years. "Look, I'm just going to come clean here: Every single U.S. drone currently deployed has been selecting and bombing targets without any guidance from military officials on the ground," a trembling Obama told reporters, admitting that he last authorized a drone attack in 2010, and that recent strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and most perplexingly, the Philippines, have been planned and executed entirely by the unmanned combat air vehicles themselves. "I'll admit that the extensive use of drone aircraft was something my administration readily embraced, but we've lost all contact with these things, and as it stands now, we have no idea who or what is controlling them--or if they're even being controlled at all. Jesus, these things are terrifying. We need to shut them down before it's too late!" At press time, all the blood had reportedly drained from Obama's face and he stood stock-still as a faint whirring noise could be heard high above the White House briefing room.
