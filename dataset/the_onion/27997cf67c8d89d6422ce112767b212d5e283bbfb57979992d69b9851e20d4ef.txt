AKRON, OH--Tiger Woods scored a career-worst 18-over-par finish at the Bridgestone Invitational Sunday, officially hitting rock bottom if one ignores the fact that he is worth over $600 million, is still the world's No. 1-ranked golfer, never has to work another day for the rest of his life, and has millions of fans worldwide. "Four rounds in the mid-to-high 70s, and finishing 78th out of 80 golfers--it simply can't get any worse for Tiger," ESPN golf analyst Andy North said of Woods, who left Sunday's round in his private jet and who, despite a damaging sex scandal, still earned more than $90 million in 2010. "Nowhere to go from here but up, [or sail up and down the California coast in his yacht for the rest of his life if he wants to]." Woods was unable to comment on reaching his personal low point, as he was too busy checking into the penthouse suite of his four-star hotel and deciding if he wanted the 12-ounce or 16-ounce filet for dinner.
