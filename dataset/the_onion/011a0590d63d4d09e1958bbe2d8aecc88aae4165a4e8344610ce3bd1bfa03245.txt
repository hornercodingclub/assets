ASHBURN, VA--The Washington Redskins bolstered their Taylor-depleted roster Monday by trading two future draft picks to the Miami Dolphins for defensive end Jason Taylor to compensate for the unfortunate loss of their previous Taylor, Sean. "We are very fortunate to acquire a Taylor of this caliber," team owner Dan Snyder said of the six-time Pro Bowler. "Since he arrived in the NFL, Jason has been one of the most consistent and durable Taylors to play the game. We consider him to be the premier defensive Taylor in the league." Snyder said the team was also looking into signing a back-up Taylor, Tyler, Williams, and Sanders to increase the team's depth at those positions.
