BALTIMORE--In an effort to improve spectator safety, Oriole Park at Camden Yards personnel announced Monday that the ballpark's concession stands will henceforth stop selling crack cocaine at the conclusion of the seventh inning. "By cutting off crack sales toward the end of the game, we feel we can enhance the overall baseball experience for all of our guests, including those who want to burn a little rock," director of ballpark operations Kevin Cummings told reporters, adding that the stadium will be leaving in place its longstanding regulations prohibiting ticket holders from purchasing more than two vials of the cocaine freebase at once, as well as instructing concession stand workers and bleacher vendors not to sell to anyone who looks like they've already had too much to smoke. "We want our visitors to exercise moderation while they're smoking crack and cheering on our Baltimore Orioles, and we feel this new rule will make that possible. From now on, fans who have been hitting the pipe all afternoon can take a bit of a breather to come down and stop tweaking out long enough to stagger home safely. That's what Orioles baseball is all about." Cummings added that the stadium's concession workers would continue to check IDs for everyone seeking to purchase crack, noting that--per Baltimore city regulations--sales of the drug are prohibited to anyone 14 years of age or younger.
