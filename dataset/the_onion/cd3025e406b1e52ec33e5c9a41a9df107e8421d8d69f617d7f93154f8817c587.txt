ST. HELENA, CA--Shockwaves rocked the world of haute cuisine today after Napa Valley health authorities discovered the iconic 3-star Michelin restaurant The Horse & Pony featured horse meat in all 18 courses of its signature chef's tasting menu. "To think that one of the finest restaurants in the country, if not the world, could have gotten away with this for so long is astonishing," said Editor-in-Chief Dana Cowin, who unwittingly relished sizable amounts of both cooked and raw horse meat in head chef Martin Flax's renowned menu of amuse-bouches and entrees, including caramelized rillettes de cheval, lavender horse truffles, and sesame pony carpaccio. "It is disgusting and beyond reprehensible. Still, to this day, I have to admit it's the best meal I've ever eaten. The stallion consomme alone was worth the price of admission." At press time, authorities were also investigating the restaurant's acclaimed pastry shop next door, The Little Mare.
