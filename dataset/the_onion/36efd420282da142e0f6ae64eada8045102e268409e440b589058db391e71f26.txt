PITTSBURGH--By using his 15 percent employee discount, Penguins center and team captain Sidney Crosby has reportedly saved hundreds of dollars on a variety of team-licensed garments, knit caps, and pencil cups for family and friends. "I've had my eye on the Penguins black pleather varsity jacket for quite a while, so I figured that now was the time to benefit from the $11.24 I could save," Crosby said. "I got my sister Taylor a Penguins hoodie, bought my dad a cool visor, and gave my mom a Sidney Crosby 24-karat gold commemorative coin. Oh, and I got Evgeni Malkin a Malkin jersey, because Malkin's his favorite player." Sidney Crosby's teammates honored the 21-year-old Tuesday by wearing the number 87 Sidney Crosby jerseys he had recently bought for them.
