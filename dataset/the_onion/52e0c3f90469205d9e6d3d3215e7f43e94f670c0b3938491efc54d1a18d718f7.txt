SUNNYVALE, CA--Expressing their concern at the man's unsettling behavior, uneasy Internet users reported Saturday that some "total creep" has just been hanging around the Entertainment Weekly website all day long. "None of us know who that weirdo is--he just showed up earlier and has been lingering around the movie reviews ever since," said 39-year-old Elaine Dolan, one of the site's many visitors disturbed by the constant presence of the unknown individual identified only as EZRyder56, who several sources reportedly had seen on a number of prior occasions lurking around the site at all hours. "I stopped by this morning to check out the latest recap real quick and I saw him there commenting on the new reboot. And when I came back in the afternoon, he was still right there hanging around the same thread. It gave me the creeps. Doesn't this guy have anything better to do than just stick around here all day making everyone else uncomfortable?" At press time, sources confirmed that the creepy guy had abruptly disappeared from the website, leading many to worry that he may have followed a young female user back to her social media accounts.
