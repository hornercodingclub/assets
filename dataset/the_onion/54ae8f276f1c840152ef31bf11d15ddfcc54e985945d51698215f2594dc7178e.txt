NEW YORK--During his recent stint on the 15-day disabled list, Hideki Matsui completed a two-day rehab assignment with Class A Tampa Yankees in which he went 2-for-6 and "didn't even hit one [home run] the whole time." "I've hit homeruns off Cy Young winners in clutch situations, but for some reason I couldn't even get an extra-base hit off some guy named Waldrop in the fourth inning of an inconsequential game," Matsui said through a translator. "I thought I was sent to Single-A to make myself feel better by humiliating these younger, less-experienced players. Sorry, that's hardly what happened." In an attempt to regain his confidence, Matsui recently traveled to Westchester, NY, claimed to be "new in town," and entered a pick-up game with some neighborhood children in which he went 1-for-5 and was picked off in an attempt to steal second base.
