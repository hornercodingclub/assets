NEW YORK--In the fast-paced world of investment banking, either you're on top of the latest trends, or they're on top of you. Just ask asshole Michael Riegert. Riegert, a senior banker with the high-powered Manhattan firm of Salomon Brothers, is one asshole who understands the importance of staying ahead of the pack. "When it comes to asset management in the '90s, you can never have too much information. That's your edge over the next guy," said the 53-year-old prick. "No matter what kind of portfolio you're building, from high-risk, high-yield National Intermediate Municipal Funds to medium-yield Asia Growth Funds, the key is knowing where the financial trends are headed they get there." "I perform asset-management services for institutional and retail clients around the globe, and, regardless of what's in a particular client's portfolio, I always give the same advice: Don't look at what works today, look at what will work ," the complete bastard noted. "As I always say, keeping current is the most valuable currency of all." "Yes, investing does involve risk and some loss of principal; there's no getting around that," said Riegert, an avid golfer and heartless son of a bitch. "But by investing wisely, you can minimize that risk and maximize profit potential. Knowledge--that's your edge."
