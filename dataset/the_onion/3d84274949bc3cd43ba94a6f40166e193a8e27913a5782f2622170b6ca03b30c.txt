ARLINGTON, TX--Following his 4-for-6, two-home-run performance against the Rangers Sunday, 36-year-old Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter went back to the team hotel and slept for almost the entire day Monday, team sources reported. "By that second home run trot, he looked absolutely exhausted," said teammate CC Sabathia, adding that Jeter began nodding off on the team bus and fell asleep immediately upon entering his hotel room. "I don't even think he took off his shoes. He just fell onto the bed and was out like a light." Added Sabathia, "Taking all those swings and running around all those bases? It was a big day for the old guy."
