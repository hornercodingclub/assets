SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA--Admitting he was having difficulty concentrating on destroying his enemy's nexus as he sat inside PC Zone internet cafe Monday, player JuHo Lee complained that the guy who died at the adjacent computer station was really starting to ruin the game for him. "I knew this was going to happen when he started losing consciousness and slumped forward on his keyboard, and I probably should've gone for help at that point, but I was just about to level up--now I have to sit next to this dead guy all night while I try to take all five capture points," Lee said as he scooted his chair away from the lifeless gamer, who he estimated had died about three or four hours earlier from deep vein thrombosis during a multiday gaming session. "Someone should at least drape a cloth over him. I can't be looking back and forth between my screen and a dead body while I'm trying to obtain a Storm Shield relic." Lee added that if no one removed the man by sunrise, he would take it upon himself to pause a minute and drag the body into the hallway.
