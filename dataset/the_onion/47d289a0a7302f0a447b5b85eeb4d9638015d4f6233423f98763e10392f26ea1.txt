RIO DE JANEIRO--Chronicling what many have called the most touching and incredible narrative of the Rio Games, NBC aired a special feature Monday about the inspirational story of Bridgestone's journey to the 2016 Olympics. "It's been such a long road, and at times it seemed impossible, but we never gave up, and now we're here in Rio alongside all the biggest brands in the world," Bridgestone CEO Masaaki Tsuya said during the three-minute NBC piece, adding that he always believed the 85-year-old auto manufacturer's logo could someday be on the Olympic medal podium in front of billions of consumers around the world. "You know, everyone always used to say we were too small, or that our marketing team wasn't experienced enough, but we proved them wrong. It just goes to show that any brand, no matter where they're headquartered or how strong their sales are, can defy the odds and achieve the Olympic dream. We're proof of that." Tsuya went on to credit Heineken's incredible commercial performance during the 2012 London Games for inspiring Bridgestone to set its sights on the Olympics.
