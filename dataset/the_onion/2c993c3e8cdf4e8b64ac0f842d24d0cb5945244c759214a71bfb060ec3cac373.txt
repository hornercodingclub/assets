BRISTOL, CT--Despite the clip airing on the 6 p.m., 8 p.m., and 11 p.m. broadcasts of , ESPN anchor Chris Berman claimed that "a devastating injury of that nature is not what fans come to see," in reference to a vicious slide-tackle that left an unidentified soccer player writhing on the pitch as his shattered tibia and fibula jutted through his skin, shin-guard, and knee-high sock. "He's going to feel that one in the morning," Berman said over the deafening roar of the crowd and the sound effect of a snapping tree branch. "Ouch." Berman, who has in the past suggested that you never want to watch a backcountry skier smack into a series of exposed rocks or a rally car hurtling out of control into a crowd of helpless spectators, added that he was "glad we can put this behind us" after the clip had been shown from several different angles in slow motion.
