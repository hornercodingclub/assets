MILWAUKEE--Moments after the Brewers officially clinched the 2008 NL wild card Sunday, CC Sabathia, Prince Fielder, and the rest of the team celebrated by jumping up and down while dousing each other with giant gouts of mayonnaise. "As soon as Ryan [Braun] hit that home run, I was like, 'Someone better put the mayo on ice,'" said Sabathia, wiping the thick, egg-and-oil based condiment off his face and then licking it off his fingers. Sabathia, who pitched a complete-game four-hitter, was engulfed in the locker room by teammates who poured seven 48-ounce jars of Hellman's mayonnaise over his head, scooping out the contents of each container with spatulas. First baseman Prince Fielder was even more animated during the celebration, at one point taking off his shirt and chugging a half gallon of mayonnaise. However, in an unfortunate incident, shortstop J.J. Hardy forgot to put on his protective goggles and will as a result miss the entire NLDS with mayo eye.
