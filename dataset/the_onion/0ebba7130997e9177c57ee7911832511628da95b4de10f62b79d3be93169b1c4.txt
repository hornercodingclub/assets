HOUSTON--While competing in the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest Saturday, contestant Gerald Green reportedly incorporated characters, dialogue, and set design from 16th-century English playwright Christopher Marlowe's into his elaborately choreographed dunk routine. "Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee/Faustus hath cut his arm, and with his proper blood/Assures his soul to be great Lucifer's/ Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!" proclaimed the spotlighted and costumed Indiana Pacers small forward before catching a full-court lob from the demon Mephisto--played by devilishly attired teammate Lance Stephenson--and driving to the hole. "View here this blood that trickles from mine arm/ And let it be propitious for my wish." Upon completing the 10-minute-long scene in which the Elizabethan drama's titular character exchanges his soul for Satan's corrupt bounty, Green dribbled between his legs, scrawled his name in Lucifer's black book, and launched toward the hoop from the free-throw line, whereupon the basketball clanged off the rim, forcing the 2007 dunk contest winner and his fellow castmates to return to half court and start the intricate routine from the beginning.
