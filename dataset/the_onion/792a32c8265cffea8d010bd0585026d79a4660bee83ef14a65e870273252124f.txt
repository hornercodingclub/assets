NEWTON, MA--Uneasy to this day over the possibility they consider him a horrible person, local man Will Donnelly is still worried that the parents of his ex-girlfriend from seven years ago hate him, sources confirmed Thursday. "I'm pretty sure Alison's dad detested me, like I just wasn't good enough to be dating his daughter," said Donnelly, in reference to the romantic relationship that amicably came to an end in 2010. "Her mom pretended to be nice to my face, but I could tell she really didn't like me either. And her brother--man, that dude definitely hated me. I don't know, it still kind of stresses me out." Reached for comment, the parents of Donnelly's ex-girlfriend said they had no strong opinion of him, once they had been reminded of his very existence.
