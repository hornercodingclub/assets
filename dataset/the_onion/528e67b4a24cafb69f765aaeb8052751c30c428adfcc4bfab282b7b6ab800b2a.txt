LOS ANGELES--Following his recent arrest at Los Angeles International Airport for making an alleged bomb threat, sources close to San Francisco 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith confirmed Tuesday that the 24-year-old is simply relieved his covert plot for an upcoming terrorist attack was not fully compromised. "It's a minor setback, but we should be able to continue moving ahead once the dust settles," Smith reportedly said while on a pay phone, stressing repeatedly that "they don't know anything." "Everything is fine--they thought the bomb thing was a joke. The operation is still set for May 16. Remember: 9 a.m. sharp." At press time, Smith had reportedly left a small unmarked package in a locker at a downtown San Jose bus station and casually walked away.
