FT. MYERS, FL--MLB pitchers and catchers reported to spring training bars throughout Arizona and Florida Thursday, arriving early to properly loosen up and get back into drinking shape. "Everybody showed up on time to take advantage of the happy hour specials, and I'm confident that we are all ready to pound some brews and start this season off right," said Red Sox catcher A.J. Pierzynski, polishing off the last of a pitcher of Budweiser. "You always feel a bit rusty picking up women for the first time in four or five months, but once you get good and lit it all starts coming back pretty easily." Local fans were reportedly excited to see their favorite ballplayers at practices, exhibition games, and passed out on barstools.
