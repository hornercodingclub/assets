DENVER--Tearing her blouse seams as she angrily flexed her massive, rippling biceps, Ashley Manning, the 14-foot-tall wife of Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, crushed the skull of a journalist inquiring about allegations that she received shipments of human growth hormone on behalf of her husband, sources confirmed Friday. "Arrrrrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhh!" the enormous, muscle-bound 390-pound woman bellowed upon being asked about her connection to the Indianapolis-based Guyer Institute medical center, before she then grabbed the reporter's head with one hand, squeezed it until his skull caved in, and violently slammed his limp body into the ground. "No comment!" Sources confirmed that Peyton Manning was unavailable for questions after his wife tucked him under her arm and carried him away.
