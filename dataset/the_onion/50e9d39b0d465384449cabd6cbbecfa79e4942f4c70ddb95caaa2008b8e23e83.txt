SAN FRANCISCO--Saying that "you never know," juror Jesse Ferguson has worn his baseball glove to the Barry Bonds perjury trial every day, telling reporters Tuesday that his seat on the jury is in a perfect spot should Bonds really connect on one. "With my luck, a hard liner would come my way the day I didn't wear a glove, so I'm just going to keep it on at all times," said Ferguson, who has taken care not to lean over the jury box railing when court is in session. "I know it's kind of childish, but there's something about attending a perjury trial with wide-ranging repercussions for the performance-enhancing-drug culture in our national pastime that brings out the kid in you." Ferguson went on to say that wearing a glove leaves one hand free to hold his beer, offer Bonds a baseball card to autograph, or take notes on the deposition.
