NEWARK, NJ--In a game that everyone in the stands and on the ice believed to be a tune-up before the NHL's regular season begins, Philadelphia Flyers goalie Ray Emery led his team to a 5-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils Saturday night. "We made a few mistakes out there, but we'll get those ironed out by the time these games count," said Flyers center Mike Richards, whose second goal of the 2009-2010 regular season lifted the Flyers to a 2-0-0 record. "You can't get too worked up about an exhibition game. Most of the fans left in the middle of the second period anyway." During a postgame press conference, Devils coach Jacques Lemaire told reporters that he wasn't worried about the loss, saying that during the regular season he would never pull his goalie for the entire third period just to get some practice playing with an extra attacker.
