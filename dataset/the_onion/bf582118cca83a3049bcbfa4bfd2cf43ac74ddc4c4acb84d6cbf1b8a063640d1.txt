SUDBURY, MA--Sources confirmed Monday that the man seen parked on a residential street at 2:00 a.m. in a '93 Ford Lightning last night is, in all likelihood, a morally upright citizen with nothing but the most virtuous intentions. "He's just been sitting there in the dark for the past thirty minutes in a car I've never seen around here before, so there's no question in my mind that whatever he's up to here, it's totally ethical and legal," Massachusetts native Samuel Brand said, adding that nothing about the man's idling on a corner well after midnight seemed at all menacing or out of the ordinary. "Based on the fact that his car is in need of repairs and he doesn't seem to have any reason to be here, it seems like this guy is just some law-abiding citizen looking to visit a friend or something. There certainly isn't anything about this situation that I could call suspicious." At press time, the man had abruptly revved his car's engine and driven away for what sources speculate are entirely innocent reasons.
