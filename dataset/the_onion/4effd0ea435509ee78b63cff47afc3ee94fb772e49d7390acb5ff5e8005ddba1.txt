MADISON, WI--Taking a moment to reflect on his hard-won personal accomplishment, area liberal Tom Hudson expressed relief Monday that he would never again have to engage in self-examination after finally assembling all the correct opinions. "It definitely wasn't easy, but now that I have all the proper perspectives on the world all perfectly arranged inside of my head, I know I'll never need to question my own thoughts, beliefs, or opinions ever again," said Hudson, proudly recounting his previous efforts at researching all necessary sociopolitical issues, conducting a rigorous self-exploration to determine which of his behaviors were problematic or harmful, and finally achieving the proper balance of beliefs to ensure once and for all that he is an indisputably good person. "It's such a huge weight off my shoulders. I never have to consider my place in society or my impact on the issues ever again now that I know exactly how to present myself as one of the good guys. This feels amazing." Hudson was then immediately and savagely attacked by his fellow liberals, who insist that his current views are nowhere near progressive enough.
