The National Labor Relations Board ruled Tuesday that even if a McDonald's restaurant is operated by a franchise, the fast food chain is still jointly responsible for the welfare of its workers, and is liable for wage and other labor violations. What do think? "Good. I hate to think the production of my bacon cheeseburger involves any kind of suffering." Trudy Newman * Oil Painting Appraiser "I don't see how you can expect McDonald's to be aware of everything that happens at every place that uses its name and sells its food." Geoffrey Hodges * Systems Analyst "As a person who has eaten at McDonald's for 40 years and tacitly agreed to the workers' conditions, I'm glad this was settled without me having to do anything." Charlie Cunningham * Elevator Inspector
