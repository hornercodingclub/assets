DANIA, FL--Stating that things are "just really crazy right now," local man James Kinter told reporters Monday that an appointment to pick up an object from his apartment floor would have to be moved to Thursday. "I'm super swamped--lots of stuff going on--so it's going to be really tough for me to fit it in today," Kinter said of moving the small, lightweight item that could be picked up and placed in its proper location in under five seconds. "The next few days are booked solid, too; the second half of the week is a lot more realistic. I'll see how early Thursday morning looks and we'll take it from there." At press time, Kinter was looking directly at the object while lying on his couch.
