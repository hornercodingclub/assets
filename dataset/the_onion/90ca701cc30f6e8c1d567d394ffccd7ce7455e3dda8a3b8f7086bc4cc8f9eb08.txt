LOS ANGELES--After losing the first two games of their first-round playoff series against the Spurs, Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni reportedly called Phil Jackson Friday to gauge his interest in the team's head coaching job, sources confirmed. "Honestly, Phil, I think you'd be a really great fit here," D'Antoni was overheard telling Jackson, adding that the championship-winning coach's signature triangle offense would "really work wonders" for the team's personnel. "You're the type of guy these players would really respond to, and you'd have pretty much total free reign to institute your brand of basketball. If you want the job, it's basically yours." Sources confirmed that over the past two weeks, injured Lakers star Kobe Bryant has reportedly called Phil Jackson several times a day, pleading with him to take over as head coach.
