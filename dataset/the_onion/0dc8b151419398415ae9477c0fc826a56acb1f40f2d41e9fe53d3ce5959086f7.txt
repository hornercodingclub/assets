FLORHAM PARK, NJ--Longing for some good news, Jets fans reportedly joined quarterback Mark Sanchez Wednesday in expressing hope that the shoulder injury Sanchez sustained during the preseason would sideline the fifth-year veteran for the remainder of the season. "Oh man, I sure hope he's done for the year, maybe for good," said 34-year-old Jets fan Lou Alameda, echoing Sanchez's stated wish for a season- or career-ending diagnosis. "Well, he's still seeking second opinions on it, so he probably won't take a snap against the Pats this week. Thank God. If this could somehow knock him out of commission for the long haul, though--that would honestly be perfect." At press time, renowned orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews had released a statement saying he also hoped Sanchez would never play football again.
