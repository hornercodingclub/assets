WASHINGTON--Inspired by the breathtaking acrobatics and death-defying high speeds of Winter Olympics events, the nation's youth were reportedly motivated this week to go out and try sports their parents could never possibly afford. "Cool, I can't wait to hit the slopes and do that," said 15-year-old Davenport, IA resident Eric Wallace, echoing the sentiment of young people across the country whose families can't pay for the highly specialized equipment and clothing, beginner instructions at expensive training facilities, participation fees, extensive travel, lift tickets, or inevitable medical bills. "It's going to be amazing when I'm flying across the snow and flipping around in the air like Shaun White." Though concerned about shelling out at least $3,000 before their children ever step foot on snow or ice, the nation's parents were reportedly excited about the money they would inevitably save when American youths immediately quit the sports after complaining they were too difficult.
