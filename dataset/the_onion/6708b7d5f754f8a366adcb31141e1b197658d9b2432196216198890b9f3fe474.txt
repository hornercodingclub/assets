NEW YORK--In a promotion aimed at encouraging people who like hockey to come and watch teams play the sport, the NHL held its first-ever Fan Attendance Night on Tuesday. "We just wanted to get a little something back from our fans and show them that, hey, we exist," said commissioner Gary Bettman, who added that the league was unable to find a sponsor for the event. "We're having lots of great promotions on these special nights: Two for the Price of Two, Bring a Friend/Bring Another Friend, and Just Show Up. And everyone who comes receives their very own commemorative card-stock ticket to that game. So, yes, please come." Bettman said he didn't think Fan Attendance Night had worked.
