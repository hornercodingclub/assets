PETERSBURG, VA--Claiming that this is unacceptable and he just won't stand for it, a local taxpayer expressed outrage Tuesday, sources confirmed. "This is an outrage," said the visibly angry man, who indicated that he pays federal, state, and local taxes. "Can you believe this crap?" A second local taxpayer standing nearby reportedly voiced his agreement with the man, stating that, indeed, this crap was an outrage and not to be believed.
