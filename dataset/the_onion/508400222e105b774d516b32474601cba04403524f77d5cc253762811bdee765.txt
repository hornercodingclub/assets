MIAMI--Describing it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get up close to the majestic mammals, visitors to Paradise Cove Resort raved to reporters Thursday about the hotel's new program that allows guests to swim with the Miami Dolphins. "I couldn't believe how friendly they were--as soon as they saw us, this great big one just came right up to our daughter," said resort guest Emily Hendrickson, calling the hour she and her family spent splashing and playing alongside the Dolphins' defensive line the "highlight of [their] trip." "I couldn't believe how smooth Ryan Tannehill was. And then there was this smaller one that really took a liking to me--he must have been a kicker. It was an amazing experience." Hendrickson later admitted that her family was disappointed they didn't get a chance to swim with center Mike Pouncey, who was in a solitary tank at the time of their visit for biting a child.
