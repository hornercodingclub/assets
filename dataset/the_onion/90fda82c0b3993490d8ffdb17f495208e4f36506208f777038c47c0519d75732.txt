WASHINGTON--Saying that she had put it off for a long time and that now was as good a time as any, Michelle Obama told sources Monday she had finally gotten around to reading her husband's 1995 memoir . "I read the first couple chapters back when it came out, but I just couldn't get through it, and it's been lying on my dresser ever since," said the first lady, explaining that she felt obligated to read President Obama's autobiographical exploration of race and identity in America even though, "to be honest, it's a little slow." "The parts about his dad seem a little overwrought, and he spends so much time writing about himself that he comes across a bit narcissistic--who writes a memoir when they're 33, anyway? I skimmed a lot of it, but I can still pretend I read the whole thing if he asks." The first lady added that fucking sucked.
