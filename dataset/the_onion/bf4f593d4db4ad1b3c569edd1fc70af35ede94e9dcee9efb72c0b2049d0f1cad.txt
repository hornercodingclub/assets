GREENVILLE, SC--Recounting the difficult circumstances that shaped his development into adulthood, Duke University shooting guard Grayson Allen recalled Friday the struggle of growing up without any principles. "It was really tough not having any ethics, especially when all the other kids did," said a visibly distressed Allen, adding that it was always hard competing in basketball games when he was the only one on the team without any sense of right and wrong. "I've spent a lot of time thinking about how it's so unfair, but at some point I've just got to accept that I don't have principles, and I never will. As I've gotten older, I've realized that finding my way in the world without values was a blessing in disguise and made me into who I am as a person." At press time, Allen told reporters that he would feel much worse about his lack of moral principles if it weren't for coach Mike Krzyzewski's unwavering support.
