WASHINGTON--A recent wave of negative bidder responses posted to Joe Biden's eBay account has for the first time dropped the vice president's already unfavorable feedback rating below the 35 percent mark. "Poor packaging, pages torn, and item routed through Tijuana and delayed more than four months!!!" read the angry feedback for VINTAGE CALENDAR OF BORIS VALLEJO EROTIC FANTASY ART, which was listed alongside items such as used kamikaze bandanas and bottles of pheromone cologne. "Seller refused to give me a refund and just said he'd give me partial credit if I wanted to buy a neon Stroh's sign. STAY AWAY!!!!" At press time, Biden's feedback rating was approaching 25 percent as no one had received the 500-count box of tanning glasses they had ordered.
