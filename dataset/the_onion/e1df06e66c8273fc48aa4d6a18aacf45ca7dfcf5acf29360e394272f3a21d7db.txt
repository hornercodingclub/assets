RICHMOND, VA--Calling it an encouraging sign for the 23-year-old, Redskins team doctors have reportedly cleared quarterback Robert Griffin III's knee to resume light tearing this week, team sources confirmed Wednesday. "Robert's knee has healed to the point where we feel he can safely start damaging the ligament again," said orthopedist James Andrews, noting that Griffin should limit himself to simple overstretching at first before gradually easing into more challenging connective tissue ripping. "Heading into August, we plan on having Robert tear his knee more severely each day so that the tendon can be 100 percent shredded by the time the season begins." Andrews added that if all goes according to plan, Griffin would be ready for a season-ending injury by as early as week one or two.
