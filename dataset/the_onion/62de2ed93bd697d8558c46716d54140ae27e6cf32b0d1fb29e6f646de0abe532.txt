WARSAW, POLAND--World leader and president of Poland Bronislaw Komorowski was reportedly puzzled Tuesday as to why he had just met with a man who was apparently the governor of Massachusetts six years ago. "That person currently holds no position of power, so I'm not sure why I would have any sort of high-level talk with him," Komorowski was overheard saying to his advisers, adding that as a head of state with a busy schedule he shouldn't be taking meetings with just anyone. "Essentially, I just had an hourlong conversation with an unemployed American man." According to sources, when reminded that the individual he had met also ran the Winter Olympics in 2002, Komorowski responded, "Who gives a shit?"
