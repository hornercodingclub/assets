Electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors has begun opening shops in malls to sell its $100,000 vehicles. What do think? "This will be a huge hit with the 'has $100,000 for an experimental luxury car but still shops in a middle-class retail setting' demographic." Brooke Lenz * Utility Assembler "Oh, no! I wish I'd known that; I just bought a Chevy Volt at an open air farmers market!" Adam Stavin * Systems Analyst "Are they hiring? After five years at Borders, I have a great deal of experience working in a retail environment people only enter to use the bathroom." Calvin Ensign * Permit Agent
