DURHAM, NC--Noting he had been caught off-guard by the question on first dates in the past, area 32-year-old Logan Firks told reporters Monday he is confident he will be ready to answer this time if the woman he is meeting for dinner asks about his siblings. "The last date I went on was going pretty well for a while, but then she just asked me point-blank if I had any brothers and sisters and I totally froze up--I didn't know what to do," said Firks, adding that while he had anticipated conversations about his career, background, and personal interests, he stuttered and "drew a total blank" when it came to saying anything specific in regard to his siblings. "The night was pretty much all downhill from there. This time, though, I'm gonna nail it: I have a younger sister, Sarah, who goes to law school at Duke. I have an older brother, Darren, who's a pharmaceutical sales rep in Phoenix with a wife and two kids." At press time, Firks had ruined the date by overeagerly blurting out the information about his siblings in a brisk and heavily rehearsed manner.
