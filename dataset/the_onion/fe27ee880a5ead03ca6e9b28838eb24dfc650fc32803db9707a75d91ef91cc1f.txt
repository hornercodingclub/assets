The Los Angeles City Council has voted to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2020, making it the biggest city in the nation to do so in an effort to improve the lives of the poorest Americans. What do think? "I'm not sure I can cope with the pressure to do $15 worth of work in an hour." Devin Tate * Gutter Unclogger "Hiking the minimum wage will destroy American business, just like it did in 1945, 1950, 1956, 1961, 1963, and 1968." Paula Bailey * Ladder Positioner "Fine, but I'm still going to treat people making minimum wage like crap." Patrick Moore * Risk Analyst
