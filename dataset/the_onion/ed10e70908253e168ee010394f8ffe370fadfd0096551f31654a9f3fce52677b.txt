CROWN POINT, IN--Saying she was happy to find a nice shady spot to sit while everyone else went on the ride, local mother Molly Costello announced Tuesday that she would rather just stay right here and watch her family have fun. "Oh, go, go, go, I just like to see you guys having a good time," said Costello, waving off her husband and three children and reassuring them that she would be right here with everyone's towels when they got off the tube slide at Deep River Waterpark. "I think I'll be able to see you coming down the big drop from here. That's plenty of excitement for me." At press time, Costello was scrambling to grab her camera as her two oldest sons emerged from the mouth of the waterslide and tumbled into the pool.
