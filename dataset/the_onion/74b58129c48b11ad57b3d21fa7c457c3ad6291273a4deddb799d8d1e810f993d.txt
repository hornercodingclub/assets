SEATTLE--Angels slugger Albert Pujols reportedly showed up to the team's dugout Tuesday with an expensive little bright-red bat, prompting players to speculate that the 32-year-old was entering a mid-career crisis. "He's seemed kind of down since his numbers started dipping and people stopped talking about him as the best hitter in baseball, so it's not really surprising to see him swinging around that brand-new sporty cherry-red bat," said Angels left fielder Vernon Wells, who confirmed Pujols had also recently attempted to appear younger by wearing tight leather pants during games. "Albert says playing with a young rookie phenom contending for the MVP doesn't make him feel insecure, but that zippy crimson bat says otherwise. He's been bragging about how the barrel is blazingly fast and cracks louder when it hits the ball, but his wife is going to kill him for blowing $50,000 on a bat." At press time, team sources confirmed Pujols had driven his 2013 Harley-Davidson Iron 883 motorcycle to the on-deck circle for batting practice.
