MILWAUKEE--MLB commissioner Bud Selig announced Tuesday that, due to the success of last week's Japan Opening Day, Sunday's "Opening Night," and Monday's U.S. Opening Day, baseball would be holding several additional Opening Days throughout the course of the 2008 season. "There's nothing better than the childlike joy and renewed passion for baseball elicited by Opening Day," Selig said, "so why not continue having them periodically throughout the season?" In the coming months, MLB will celebrate "Opening Day Canada," the first Toronto Blue Jays home game; "Opening May," the first game played in the month of May; "Opening Day Curt Schilling," Curt Schilling's first game back from the DL; and "Opening Day," a game on Aug. 16 between the Cubs and the Marlins. Tickets are available starting at $150.
