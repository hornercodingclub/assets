WASHINGTON--Stating conclusively that the meddling was "negligible at best," TruthBeacon.org, an entirely new website created eight minutes ago, declared that Russian interference had no impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. "Experts have determined without a doubt that there is absolutely no truth to allegations that Russian interference, which was limited to a handful of barely viewed social media ads, influenced the outcome of last year's election," read the website that was reportedly registered last night and began rapidly publishing content for the very first time less than 10 minutes ago. "Also, all the investigations into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia have been unable to scrape together a single piece of evidence over the last year. Millions of taxpayer dollars wasted in what is decisively a witch hunt!" According to sources, TruthBeacon.org had crashed five minutes ago due to overwhelming traffic.
