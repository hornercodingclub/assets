DALLAS--Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo requested that radiologists examining the thumb on his non-throwing hand Monday also X-ray the sore paw of Mr. Snuggy Puff, Romo's stuffed bunny. "He's got a boo-boo and he doesn't feel good, either," said Romo, who wrapped the stuffed animal's left limb in toilet paper to create a makeshift cast. "You need to look inside of it to make sure he can still hop around the pillows before bedtime." Romo, who confirmed he did not cry once during the entire visit to the doctor's office, also told the nurse that Mr. Snuggy Puff needed his own lollipop.
