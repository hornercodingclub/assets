KANSAS CITY--A fatigue-stricken Buck O'Neil, the 94-year-old former Negro Leagues star, is going to be forced to spend another year patiently waiting to gain admittance into a Kansas City hospital. "Even though his vital statistics don't necessarily warrant entry, we thought he still had an excellent chance of getting in," O'Neil's friend Bob Kendrick said. "When Buck was ultimately rejected, his spirits remained high, but we all know that Buck is hurting on the inside." Kendrick added that, though O'Neil would never say so, all Buck wants is to make it into the hospital before he dies.
