In Glendale, AZ for the first show of his new Believe Tour, 18-year-old pop superstar Justin Bieber vomited on stage, but then went on to finish his set, later attributing his illness to drinking milk. What do think? "He's so hardcore, though, he probably went backstage after the concert and chugged another quart of 1 percent." Lisa Jarvis * Office Chair Assembler "Yeah, but it was during the song 'Girl, I Barf 4 U,' so I think it was part of the act." Cal Prendergast * Undercoat Sprayer "Cool. I hear his live vomit is way better than his studio vomit." Daisuke Yoshida * Aerial Photographer
