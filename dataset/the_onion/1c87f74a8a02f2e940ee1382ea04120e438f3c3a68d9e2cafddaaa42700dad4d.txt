CHICAGO--Upon spotting the blue carabiner connecting his keys to his pants' belt loop, coworkers of local software engineer Peter Slotnick speculated Tuesday that the 34-year-old man must rappel into their office building every morning. "After seeing the way Pete carries around his house keys and electronic office-door fob, it's obvious to me that he begins each day by gliding effortlessly down a rope along the exterior of the building, skillfully bouncing off the facade every 10 feet or so," said colleague Eileen Pickering, adding that after he descends to the 14th floor, Slotnick likely pushes off one final time before bursting through the window into the conference room, rolling across the floor, brushing bits of glass from his clothing, and seating himself for the company's morning meeting. "I bet while we're all taking the stairs or walking to lunch, he's swinging over alleyways or maybe zip-lining his way around the city on a network of secured steel cables. He probably just clips that thing on and away he goes." Coworkers added that the small Swiss Army knife Slotnick keeps on his keyring must come in handy on days he needs to skin and field-dress large game on his commute home.
