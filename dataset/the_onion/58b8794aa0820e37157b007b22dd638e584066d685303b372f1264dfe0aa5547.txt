SALT LAKE CITY--With 4.3 seconds left on the clock and the Jazz about to inbound the ball, NBA referee Ed Malloy whistled play dead and accidentally called the visiting Bucks for offsides Monday. "Offsides, number 15, defense," Malloy said to the confused crowd after throwing a yellow flag he mistakenly put in his pocket before the game and fumbling for a nonexistent microphone transmitter. "Five-yard penalty. Remains first down." Despite acknowledging his mistake, Malloy proceeded to unwittingly place the basketball five yards down the court under Utah center Al Jefferson and unintentionally make a sweeping circular movement with his arm as if to reset a play clock.
