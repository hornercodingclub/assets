FAIRMONT, WV--In an announcement that has caused the golfer to lose further endorsement deals and degraded his already meager public esteem, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration released a report Monday citing a West Virginia coal mine owned by Tiger Woods for more than 400 violations. "This is one of the worst cases of workplace negligence we've seen in decades," said OSHA spokesman Mark Colson, adding that the mine has been the site of 24 deaths in the past five years. "I have to question if this man has any shred of conscience at all. His near total disregard for the people in his life who depend on him is simply staggering." The mine report is only the latest bad publicity for Woods, following March's revelation that he provided much of Bosnian genocidaire Slobodan Milosevic's political support in the late 1990s and January's news that he destroyed a painting he owned, a major work by Andy Warhol, in a sex accident.
