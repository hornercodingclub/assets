CINCINNATI--Stressing that the 26-year-old still has "plenty of time to figure everything out," Tina Dalton, mother of Bengals starting quarterback Andy Dalton, reportedly encouraged her son Monday to keep his career options open for the next few years. "At your age, it's important to just keep trying new things to see what you like and don't like," Dalton told her son, adding that while it's "really great" that he enjoys his current job, the third-year quarterback should avoid becoming stuck in a career that ultimately may not be the right fit for him. "You're only in your mid-20s, so just keep an open mind toward any opportunities that might come along, especially ones that actually offer a long-term future. Remember that your cousin Ethan worked in business for five years before going to law school, and now he couldn't be happier." Sources also confirmed that Dalton advised her son not to become too attached to Cincinnati, saying that no one would ever want to settle down and live there for more than a few years.
