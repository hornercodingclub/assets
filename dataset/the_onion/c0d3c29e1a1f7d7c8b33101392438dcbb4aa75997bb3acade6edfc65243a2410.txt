INDIANAPOLIS--George Mason reserve point guard Roland Farragut chalked up a stunning upset of his mother Wednesday night when he made a last-second long-distance phone call from all the way downtown after a desperate attempt to score. "Never in a million years did I think I would live to see this," said Audrey Farragut, who said she was "monumentally, unbelievably disappointed" by her son's improbable telephone call from a downtown Indianapolis police station, made just moments before the final buzzer sounded at the precinct and arresting officers took Farragut for preliminary booking. "They said my Roland had no business playing with the big boys, and after this shocker, I'm beginning to think they were right. Mark my words, we'll be talking about this one for years to come." Those close to the Farraguts have said the prayer Roland sent up brought Mrs. Farragut to her feet, and are describing her condition as completely stunned and still unable to believe that this really happened.
