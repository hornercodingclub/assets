LAS VEGAS--In a spontaneous romantic gesture by the 10-time Grammy Award winner, guitarist Carlos Santana presented his wife, Cindy Blackman, with a handmade coupon redeemable for a complimentary 45-minute guitar solo Wednesday, sources confirmed. "There's no expiration date--this one's good anytime, babe," Santana said of the signed certificate bordered with hand-drawn hearts and musical notes, which is said to grant the bearer "One (1) solo, either electric or acoustic, of no less than 45 minutes." "No matter what time of day, no matter what I'm doing, just hand over the coupon and I'll give you a solo you won't forget." Sources reported that Blackman then thanked her husband for the gift before adding it to the nightstand drawer where she keeps all the previous Santana-solo coupons she has received.
