NEW YORK--Saying it "might be years before America's Team recovers from the devastation," Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told reporters Monday his team's 27-24 defeat by the New York Jets on Sept. 11 marked the worst 9/11 on record. "I'll never forget where I was on Sept. 11 when that punt was blocked and our team just collapsed," said Jones, adding that he was still struggling to comprehend the enormity of the loss. "All I could do was watch from the sidelines... I kept thinking, 'This can't be happening. This can't be real.' But it was." The almost inconsolable Jones stated that "As of 9/11, we are all Dallas Cowboys" before succumbing to grief and being escorted from the building.
