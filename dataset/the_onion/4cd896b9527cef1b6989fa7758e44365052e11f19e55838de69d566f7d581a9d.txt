OAK BROOK, IL--Calling the new menu item a cool, refreshing way for consumers to finish their meals, McDonald's officials introduced the Spearmint After-Dinner Big Mac during a press event Tuesday at the company's corporate headquarters. "Our new Spearmint Big Mac takes the classic, all-American burger customers love and gives it a minty twist that's perfect for cleansing your palate and freshening your breath," said McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook, explaining that the new Big Mac's menthol-and-sesame-seed bun, spearmint-oil-infused American cheese, and two all-beef patties provide a delicious and intense burst of mint that's "perfect for capping off any Value Meal." "Plus, the cooling micro-crystals in our crisp new Special Sauce provide the Spearmint Big Mac with an icy mint rush that leaves your mouth feeling clean and frosty for the rest of the day." Easterbrook added that the company is also developing a six-piece Chicken McNugget Aperitif Combo with port and cognac dipping sauces to help settle patrons' stomachs and aid digestion.
