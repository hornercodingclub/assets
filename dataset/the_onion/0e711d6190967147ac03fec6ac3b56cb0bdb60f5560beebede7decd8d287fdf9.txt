SAN DIEGO--Estimating the temperature near the bench to be at least 85 degrees, both players and coaches on the Oakland Raiders expressed their frustration Sunday over veteran safety Charles Woodson repeatedly asking to turn up the heaters on the sideline. "It must be 70 degrees out right now, but he keeps complaining about how nippy it is and asking to bring the heaters closer to him," said Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper, adding that Woodson has also been wrapping himself in blankets on the bench in order to avoid "catching a chill." "And if we don't turn the heat up right away, he keeps coughing and looking at us to get our attention. This is ridiculous--we're all sweating our asses off out here." At press time, Woodson had told teammates that it was simply too drafty out and went back into the locker room.
