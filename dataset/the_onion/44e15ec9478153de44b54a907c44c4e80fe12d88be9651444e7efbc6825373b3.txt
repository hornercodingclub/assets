MIAMI--Calling the seemingly unplanned celebration "quite the party," city residents were reportedly delighted at the impromptu parade that broke out in downtown Miami on Monday. "Well! It's certainly not every day you walk out your front door to see a giant parade rolling by for no reason," said local retiree Glynnis Larson, 63, who added that it had been nearly a year since the last time she saw such a spirited rally spontaneously erupt on a random weekday. "And just look at all those tall young men cheering on top of that double-decker bus--they look like they're having a really nice time. This truly is the greatest city in the world." Following the passing of the unidentified parade, the 400,000 Miami residents who attended the event reasoned that it was probably for some sort of pre-Fourth of July celebration.
