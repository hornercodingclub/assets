HENNIKER, NH--Saying his performance in last night's Iowa caucuses provided just the push he needed, advisors for Jeb Bush expressed their hope Tuesday that the Republican candidate has finally garnered enough momentum to end his presidential campaign. "If you look back across several weeks of polling data, you can see that Jeb is definitely starting to build a full head of steam and appears to be in an excellent position to exit the presidential race," said campaign manager Danny Diaz, adding that Bush wasn't just picking up speed in the early primary states but across the country as a whole, and appeared poised to retake the national spotlight by announcing the suspension of his campaign. "New Hampshire can be a significant turning point for this campaign if Jeb finishes similarly there. It feels like we could certainly keep following this trajectory and make a big move to call it quits. Let me tell you, there's a certain energy in the Bush camp right now." At press time, Bush's campaign office was buzzing with dozens of staffers canceling accommodations and tour stops all across South Carolina and Nevada.
