WASHINGTON--Stating that the extremely traumatic nature of the event appeared to have left many respondents with unusually strong and vivid memories, the Pew Research Center released a new poll Friday revealing that most Americans can still recall exactly where they were when Gandalf the Grey fell into the abyss at the Mines of Moria. "I distinctly remember my dad and I sitting in front of the living room TV as we watched Gandalf fall--I remember just staring in total shock," said Peter Lee of Anaheim, CA, one of the 1,500 individuals surveyed for the poll, which found that many Americans possessed near-photographic memories of their precise location, who they were with, as well as the emotions experienced upon seeing Balrog wrap his fiery whip around Gandalf's legs. "We couldn't believe it was actually happening. That moment is seared into my brain. I'll never forget watching Gandalf tumble down and say 'Fly, you fools' just before plummeting into the darkness. Things were never really the same again after that." The poll also showed that many Americans later struggled to broach the subject of Gandalf falling into the bottomless pit with their young children.
