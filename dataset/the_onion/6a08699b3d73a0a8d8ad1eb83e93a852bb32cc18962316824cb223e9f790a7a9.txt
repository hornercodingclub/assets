INDIANAPOLIS--Following a controversial call Saturday, the home crowd at Lucas Oil Stadium told reporters that they disagree with the referee but respect his decision. "'Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit' is something you might mindlessly chant at a time like this if you didn't realize that this ref is simply doing a very tough job to the best of his abilities," said Rob White, 29, speaking on behalf of the roughly 67,000 Colts fans in attendance, all of whom conceded that the benefits of a neutral party upholding the rules and regulations of a professional sporting event far outweigh the occasional officiating errors. "None of us would have thrown that flag, but then again, from our vantage point, we might have missed something that he saw. Regardless, it's important that we accept his ruling in order to maintain the legitimacy of positivist law in football. We're ready to move on." At press time, Colts head coach Chuck Pagano was reportedly pulling the referee aside to tell him that, while he might have made a mistake in calling this particular penalty, his efforts are still very much appreciated.
