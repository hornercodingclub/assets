NEW YORK--Saying he realizes the whole thing is "incredibly nerdy," embarrassed Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai announced at a press event today that the company would be releasing a new video game system later this year. "Look, I'm sure this all sounds just incredibly dorky, but apparently it's going to have some pretty cool first-person shooting games on it and maybe some sports stuff too," said the red-faced Hirai, admitting that while he's "not personally into this sort of thing," the device itself actually looks relatively appealing and even has the ability to play Blu-ray and surf the internet. "Apparently, it's going to be called the Playstation 4, which, again, I know is just super lame, but from what everyone's been telling me it's supposed to be pretty cool for being a video game thing, so who knows. It could end up being kind of neat to have around the house. You know, just as a fun, dweeby toy." Hirai went on to say that Sony was working on a new generation of laptops, but noted that it was something the geekier guys at work know more about.
