JACKSONVILLE, FL--Claiming that the players completely squandered the opportunity to be selected third overall in this year's NFL Draft, bewildered officials from the Jacksonville Jaguars front office confirmed Friday that a large number of top prospects readily offered to discuss their prior drug use and criminal activity during interviews with the team. "It really only took one or two minutes before most players started openly talking about their troubled pasts and how they would never change," said Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley, adding that almost every player freely admitted to associating with known gang members, frequently visiting prostitutes, and carrying unlicensed firearms at all times. "One guy told me that even though it's not publicly known, he was arrested the night before, and another came right out and told me he was currently high. Plus, one of the corners we had at the top of our board immediately told us he's planning on stabbing someone at a nightclub next week. This was a particularly forthright class." Jaguars personnel told reporters this was the most eye-opening round of interviews since 2012, when Andrew Luck assured Jacksonville scouts that he would soon be indicted on rape charges.
