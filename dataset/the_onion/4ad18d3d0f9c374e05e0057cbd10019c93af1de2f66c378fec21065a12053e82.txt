MIAMI--Noting that Tuesday's primary contests could very likely determine the outcome of the Republican nomination, Marco Rubio's presidential campaign reportedly sent a heartbreaking email to supporters Monday urging them to send the candidate something that might make him smile. "With just one day left until critical primary elections in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois, and Missouri, Marco needs your support more than ever! Contributing your signature to a nice e-card for Marco, or even sending him a link to a fun YouTube video will really help him out--anything to let him know you're thinking about him," read the agonizingly poignant email in part, replacing the typical monetary donation links within the message with suggestions that supporters "Write Him An Encouraging Note" or "Draw Him A Picture." "If you're able, you could email Marco a photograph of you wearing your Rubio 2016 shirt. He would really love that. Remember, no gesture is too big or too small to buoy his spirits at this critical juncture in the campaign." The email reportedly closed with one final encouragement that supporters make whatever effort they could to warm Rubio's heart, emphasizing that the campaign would not be asking for anything further after this.
