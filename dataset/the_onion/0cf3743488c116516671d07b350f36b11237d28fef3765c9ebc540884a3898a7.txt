CHICAGO--Blasting the group's "absolutely pathetic" first-half snacking effort, Super Bowl party host Glenn Warren reportedly flew into a wild rage Sunday, screaming at guests to start munching with some intensity. "Come on, we're getting crushed out there--we only racked up 44 chips in the first half," said Warren, who sources confirmed was angrily pacing up and down the living room. "I want to see four or five people swarming to the dip. On the last drive, not even one of you touched the damn guacamole. We need to make our presence felt and really hit that veggie platter. It's crunch time." At press time, Warren was frantically yelling at guests to jump on a loose cheese ball.
