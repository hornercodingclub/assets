NASHVILLE, TN--Titans general manager Floyd Reese announced Tuesday that, upon returning to the team's practice facility, Steve McNair would be required to meet with trainers to assess the condition of his torn pectoral muscle, take a standard NFL physical, meet with the head office concerning his contract, and take and pass the Tennessee State Notary Public exam. "It came to our attention that Steve failed his exit physical after last season, and we believe his inability to perform on the field could hurt the team just as much as his inability to settle grievances with Titans management or his current inability to officially witness or authenticate vital public documents," Reese said, refusing to acknowledge insinuations that he or the Titans were being unusually harsh to the veteran quarterback. "For the kind of money we're paying Steve, we think we have a right to expect an effective leader on the field and a certified notary public the rest of the time." McNair would not respond to Reese's requirements, saying only that studying for the team-mandated realtor's exam was taking up all his time this offseason.
