WINSTON-SALEM, NC--In what many are calling a stunning and wildly unexpected development, witnesses confirmed Monday that a college student charging at full speed across Wake Forest University's Davis Field may actually have an outside chance of catching the Frisbee currently gliding to the ground. "As soon as that thing went in the air, I thought, 'Sorry, man, there's no way,' but turns out he's a lot faster than he looks," said onlooker Julia Maddock, 20, who noted that though the awkward, wobbling toss initially seemed tilted at too severe an angle to be catchable, the student has since covered such an incredible distance that he might-- --just get there before it hits the grass. "He just took off and made a beeline straight for where he somehow knew it was headed. Christ, look at him go. He still probably won't get there in time, but it's a miracle he even has a shot here." At press time, sources at the scene were confirming with astonishment that the son of a bitch is actually diving headfirst to try to catch it.
