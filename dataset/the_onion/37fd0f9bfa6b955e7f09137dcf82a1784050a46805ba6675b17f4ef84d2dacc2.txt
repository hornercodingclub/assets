CHAPEL HILL, NC--Confirming the long-theorized connection between human nervousness and the attempt to find a better view while in a public space, a study published Tuesday by the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina found that human anxiety is highest when sitting in the wrong seat at a concert. "Our findings prove that sitting just a couple rows closer to the stage than the the seat specified on your ticket is enough to provoke an intense anxiety spike in humans," said lead researcher Dr. Ruben Bautista, explaining that elevated cortisone levels correlate closely with each successive row participants moved forward. "In addition, observations have consistently shown that greater and greater unease and apprehension is generated with every new person entering the venue looking for their seat, with stressors reaching peak levels upon seeing a concert patron going to the usher for assistance. Even the mere act of someone pointing at the crowd during a conversation with a venue employee can cause an immediate and severe anxiety attack." Bautista noted that anxieties can transition to major depressive episodes if the individual is confronted in front of the whole crowd and asked to please get up and return to his or her assigned seat.
