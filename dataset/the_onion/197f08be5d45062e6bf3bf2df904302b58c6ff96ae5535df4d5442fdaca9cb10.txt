--Saying it was time to get back to basics and "start fresh," top-level sources at Romney 2012 headquarters announced plans to reboot and reenergize the campaign for the 72nd consecutive week Monday. "We're looking forward to wiping the slate clean, getting back out there among voters, and showing Americans who Mitt really is and how his policies will work for them," said communications director Gail Gitcho, stating that the campaign had hit the "reset button" and citizens could look forward to getting to know "the real Mitt" over the next several days, a statement she has made every week since May 2011. "It's important that we pivot back to Gov. Romney's central message of economic opportunity for all Americans and just let Mitt be Mitt. I think voters will really like what they hear." At press time, Romney staffers are already prepping for next week's campaign reboot after remarks the candidate just uttered at a voter rally in Pueblo, CO.
