Nurse! Nurse! Remove this mustard plaster from my chest! It chafes! Nurse! Oh, I forgot. My nurse is now a terrifying ro-bot gentleman. No, no, Mr. Tin! You have removed whatever skin I had remaining on my leprous old torso! Stupid ro-bot! Well, I may be down, but this miserable old invalid still has a few irons in the fire. Goodness knows I'm always ready to exploit any valuable information or leads I obtain to their fullest economic advantage. And a little bird tells me that the latest scandal brewing down in Washington is money in the bank! Standish! Get my stenographer in here right away. I wish to cable an urgent telegram to the President.  In light of my considerable aid, surely a little executive payola would not be inappropriate in return. I have surmised a golden opportunity, having heard the rumor that your Secretary of Interior has accepted bribes from private oil interests. Don't ask how I know this, just understand that I do. I'll get down to brass tacks, Warren my friend. I want in on the Teapot-Dome scandal! Have your chief-of-staff leave a carpet-bag filled with $275,000 in small bills in the locker-room of the Georgetown train station. My man-servant will collect it. He will be the one in the pony and trap and sporting a red carnation in his boutonniere. I trust this will be done by mid-day tomorrow, or I will blow the whole scandal sky-high. The news will outsell even the Fatty Arbuckle saga, I assure you. I would hate for our fine friendship to be forever ruined by any reluctance on your part.  Standish, relay this to the village post-mistress, and be quick about it. I'll be damned if I let this slip past my arthritic fingers!
