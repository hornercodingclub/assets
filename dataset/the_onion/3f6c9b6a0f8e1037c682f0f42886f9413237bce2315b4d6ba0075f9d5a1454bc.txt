DECATUR, IL--Telling the 17-year-old to "play through" the brain injury he sustained from a vicious hit during a game against Danville, West High football coach Doug Husted reportedly encouraged tailback Marcus Fisher Thursday night to shake off his cognitive impairment and get back out there. "Show a little backbone now, son!" said Husted, who instructed Fisher to catch his breath, drink some water, and shrug off the bruises on his cerebrum. "A true champion doesn't let a little blood on his brain slow him down. So suck it up--I need you back out there in three plays." Sources confirmed Husted then forcefully hit the concussed 17-year-old on the back of his helmet and told him he had a game to win.
