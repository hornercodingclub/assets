NEW YORK--According to critics, the new Liberace biopic , which premiered on HBO last month, reveals that the famed musician and performer was good friends with a number of gay men in his personal life. "Everybody knows Liberace for his extravagant wardrobe, virtuosic piano performances, and endearing Midwestern sensibilities, but what a lot of people don't know, which this film shows, is that Liberace also counted a number of gay men among his close personal friends," said television critic Jeff Wasser of the film, which shows Liberace, famed pianist and lover of figure-skating champ Sonja Henie, developing friendships with many homosexuals, whom he often invited to his home for dinner, swimming, and conversation. "He was apparently quite progressive in that regard and did not discriminate against gay men in the slightest, despite being a famous ladies' man. In fact, he would even bestow numerous gifts upon his gay male friends as a token of his friendship." Wasser added that he particularly enjoyed the film's portrayal of Liberace's relationship with his gay chauffeur, who became perhaps his closest buddy.
