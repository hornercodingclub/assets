SANTA CLARA, CA--Curiously studying the sterling championship trophy ahead of Super Bowl 50, Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips expressed confusion to reporters Thursday over why the Lombardi Trophy has a big silver egg on top of it. "It's a nice trophy, but I don't get why there's a huge egg on it," said a visibly perplexed Phillips, furrowing his brow and crossing his arms as he wondered aloud whether large eggs were featured in some way during the first Super Bowl. "I don't get it. Whose idea was it to put an egg on top? It's a pretty big egg, too--a lot bigger than other eggs--but eggs don't have anything to do with the Super Bowl. Did Vince Lombardi like eggs? Is that why?" At press time, Phillips was carefully tapping the trophy against the ground in an attempt to crack the egg open.
