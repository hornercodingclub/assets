CLEVELAND--Despite the TNT network's best efforts to acquaint its audience with the major players of the Magic-Cavaliers playoff series, the population of the United States has emphatically declined the opportunity to get to know Orlando's Hedo Turkoglu. "When I see one of those pre-produced packages about how he's from Serbia or wherever, I immediately mute my TV or change the channel," Atlanta resident Kevin Hazan said concerning the Turkish small forward. Added Portland, OR basketball fan Russel Carreras, "That little video of him listing all his favorite foods and making goofy faces just didn't grab me. I don't really care if he's a family man who helps out in the Orlando community. Actually, I don't care if he saves a thousand children from a burning fire. I just don't care to welcome Hedo Turkoglu into my home." In contrast to the nation's utter indifference toward Turkoglu, a TNT poll indicated that if given the choice, most viewers would still prefer to smack J.J. Redick right in the face.
