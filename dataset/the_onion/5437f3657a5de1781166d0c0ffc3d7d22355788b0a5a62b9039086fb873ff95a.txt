WALTHAM, MA--Using the subject heading "you should definitely check this out," Thomas A. Kennedy, CEO of the defense contractor Raytheon, reportedly emailed President Obama today with yet another link to an article detailing mounting tensions in Libya. "Hey Barack, just thought you might be interested in this," read the email, the sixth such message sent from Kennedy in the past month, in which he CC'd Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and provided a link to a recent CNN story about ISIS gaining a foothold in the Libyan city of Derna. "Looks like things are really getting out of hand over there. A lot of people are saying it could destabilize the whole region." Sources confirmed that several minutes after sending the email, Kennedy received a curt reply from Obama indicating that he had already seen the story earlier in the week when it was sent to him by executives at Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, ATK, General Dynamics, and Boeing.
