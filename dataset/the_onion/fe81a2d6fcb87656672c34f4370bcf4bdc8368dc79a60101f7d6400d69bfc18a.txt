PHILADELPHIA--Americans are fairly sure, though unable to say for certain, that the Philadelphia Phillies won the 2008 World Series, thereby breaking their city's longstanding sports-championship drought. "Yeah...I kind of think I remember seeing them celebrating before was on," said Minnesota resident Ed Siclari, who believes the Phillies may have defeated the Red Sox or Yankees in the World Series and during the NLCS almost definitely played that team Manny Ramirez currently plays on. "I'm not sure whether it was close or a blowout, but I know the winning team had reddish uniforms. And there was that whole rain thing, unless that was last year?" After a quick Google search for "world series mvp," Siclari and the rest of the nation were surprised to learn the award did not go to Phillies slugger Howard Ryan.
