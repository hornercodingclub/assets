SAN ANTONIO--Stressing that it is a "very complicated socioeconomic issue," Spurs power forward Tim Duncan reportedly urged teammates Thursday to come to him with any questions or concerns they may have about the automatic federal spending cuts enacted by the ongoing government sequester. "You might not think it affects you guys, but San Antonio's transportation infrastructure has already taken a hit due to forced staffing cuts, not to mention the potential $67 million loss of education funding," said the three-time NBA Finals MVP, who recently sent the team a mass e-mail with a comprehensive breakdown of the $85 billion in cuts at both the federal and statewide level. "I'll be around after practice, and if anything comes up later or you'd prefer to talk one-on-one, feel free to call me at home. I also have some additional literature on the subject, including Bob Woodward's controversial , if you're interested in reading up on sequestration yourself." At press time, Duncan was e-mailing his local congressmen to suggest a $55 billion reduction in defense spending and a 4 percent tax increase on adjusted gross incomes over $5 million in order to balance the budget.
