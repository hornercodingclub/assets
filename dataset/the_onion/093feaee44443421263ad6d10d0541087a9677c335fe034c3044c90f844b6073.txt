WASHINGTON--According to a Census Bureau report released Thursday, Hispanics are now projected to make up the majority of the U.S. populace by the middle of local father-in-law Jerry Stambaugh's rant. "We found that Latinos are on track to outnumber whites in this country as early as when Jerry starts in on how they're taking all the jobs and how there are too many of them already," said Census Bureau associate director for field operations William H. Hatcher Jr., adding that, if the pace of immigration accelerates, the historic demographic shift may even occur by the time the 58-year-old father-in-law's tirade reveals Hispanics breed like rabbits and drain the country's valuable resources. "Our research suggests that, further down the road, when he angrily launches into how things were a hell of a lot different when he was growing up, the Latino population may reach upwards of 55 or even 60 percent of the nation's population. Even our most conservative estimates posit a Hispanic majority before Stambaugh declares how those people should just go back to their own country." Experts further projected that no real Americans would be left in the country by the end of Stambaugh's epithet-filled ramblings.
