YOUNGSTOWN, OH--According to statements made Monday by local resident David Kearney, a 36-year-old delivery driver who will die in a fireworks mishap months before the general election, he is "a Trump man all the way." "I like what Trump has to say--he isn't afraid to take on anyone," said the man who, long before November, will be pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital after duct-taping several M-80s together in his backyard, lighting the self-rigged explosive device, and then, after accidentally knocking the mortar tube on its side while attempting to run away from the blast, will suffer severe trauma as his "Stone Cold" Steve Austin shirt and cargo shorts are set ablaze while his horrified family looks on. "The politicians in Washington lie to our faces. Trump's the only one who tells the truth. He'll turn the country around." Kearney said he was convinced to vote for Trump by the candidate's debate performances, events he was narrowly able to witness following a close call last summer when his ATV overturned at high speed after he lost control of the vehicle while firing a handgun at a stop sign.
