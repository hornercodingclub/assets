DALLAS--Saying that he's never seen it but that there's probably one around somewhere, 24-year-old web developer Doug Horton told reporters Wednesday he is willing to just assume his apartment has a functional carbon monoxide detector. "I'm sure there's one on a wall in the kitchen, or maybe in the bedroom," said Horton, sitting on his sofa as he briefly scanned his living room for a device that looked like it might raise an alarm in the event of a deadly gas leak. "There has to be one, right? And even if there wasn't, I'd probably still be able to see or at least smell any carbon monoxide that got in here, so I'm not too worried." At press time, reports confirmed Horton had decided to open a window "just in case."
