NEW YORK--Sportswriter and pundit Mike Lupica, a regular panelist on ESPN's , used the time given him during the "Parting Shot" segment of last Sunday's show to alert the television audience to the recent disappearance of his beagle-Dachshund mix. "Our love of dogs, like our love of sports, has the power to bring us together despite our differences," Lupica said, holding a recent photo of his dog up to the camera. "Whether you agree with everything I say or not, I implore anyone out there who may have seen Puppica to please contact me care of ESPN or the . I can't answer all your letters, but I promise I will give them all consideration. He's wearing a blue collar and likes to fetch grounders. Thank you." Immediately after Lupica's monologue, Stephen A. Smith used his allotted "Parting Shot" screen time to point out that none of his many dogs, who "obviously loved [him] more than Lupica's dog loved his owner," had "ever, ever run away, and quite frankly, never would."
