NEW YORK--Marketing the emergency auto-injector as the perfect product for romantic evenings when you and a partner go into anaphylactic shock simultaneously, Pfizer unveiled a new line of double-sided EpiPen devices Wednesday designed exclusively for lovers. "We recognized a real shortage of intimate, life-saving injectables in today's emergency vasoconstrictor delivery-systems market," said CEO Ian C. Read, emphasizing that the goal of the new EpiPen-Duo was not only to prevent sudden airway-collapse-based asphyxiation, but also to bring couples closer. "So much of the average allergic episode is spent alone, frantically gasping for air and clawing at your own throat--wouldn't it be wonderful if couples could simply appreciate each other during those moments? Whether you're reacting violently during a candlelit shellfish dinner for two or a romantic beekeeping session, rest assured that the double-sided EpiPen-Duo will be there for you when your breathing goes wrong--but the moment feels right." Read added that the EpiPen-Duo would soon be available at all 650 Spencer's Gifts locations.
