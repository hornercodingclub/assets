COLUMBUS, OH--Unequipped with a smartphone or any other way to access a consensus opinion on the restaurant's food and service, local woman Tanya Shaw reportedly drew a deep, resolved breath earlier today as she bravely entered Madam Jane's Thai Cuisine without first looking it up online. "Well, I haven't pored over the menu on the restaurant's website, read the first 20 Yelp ratings, or scanned any online reviews from blogs or newspapers, but here we go," Shaw said to herself as she valiantly opened the door of the small Thai cafe, knowing she could very well be subjecting herself to a meal that got a "Like It" rating of 40 percent on Urbanspoon. "Christ, I haven't even seen a single picture of the food before on someone's Tumblr page. I'm flying totally blind here." At press time, Shaw had ordered an appetizer and an entree based purely on their menu descriptions, having no idea if either item had made Zagat.com's list of "Signature Dishes."
