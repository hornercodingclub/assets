LOS ANGELES--Saying he didn't want to go overboard but thought it would be a pretty good investment considering his line of work, veteran actor George Clooney told reporters Wednesday he's been thinking about just going ahead and buying his own tuxedo. "At first I thought I wouldn't need one, but I walk into a rental store around 175 times a year, and even the guys there say, 'Why don't you just buy one already?'" Clooney told magazine, explaining that he spent more than $300,000 last year renting the same black Giorgio Armani. "That makes sense, because I'd get a lot of mileage out of it, and after a while, it would probably pay for itself. Maybe I'll wait and see if I get invited to the Oscars this year, just in case." Clooney added that because he travels so frequently, he is also considering buying a car instead of using a bus pass.
