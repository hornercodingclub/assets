NEW YORK--Claiming that there is ostensibly no rhyme or reason to the sport's frequent in-game substitutions, players from across the NHL admitted Wednesday that they have absolutely no idea how line changes work. "Honestly, most of the time I just try to jump onto the ice whenever I can, and then I'll come back to the bench when I get tired," said Chicago Blackhawks center Jonathan Toews, adding that the changes are especially confusing following icing calls, when "some guys are allowed to change but other guys aren't." "I know certain players are supposed to go out at specific times and in 'shifts' or whatever, but I couldn't even begin to tell you who, when, or why. Like when we're on a power play, there are certain guys who are supposed to play, but then if the other team is on a power play, a whole different set of guys go out. And most of the time we have to sub in and out while the game is still going on. It's just chaos." A majority of players also confirmed they would much prefer having some kind of buzzer sewn into their uniforms to alert them when it's their turn to take the ice.
