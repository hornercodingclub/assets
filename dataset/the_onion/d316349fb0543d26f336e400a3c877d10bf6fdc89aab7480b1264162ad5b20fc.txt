NEW YORK--Sources close to the Jets offensive line confirmed the players have enrolled in a continuing education course on pass blocking, attending their first class Monday at Hunter College to receive basic instruction on quarterback protection. "We are all learning a lot, and our teacher, Mr. Munoz, is really nice and knows what he's talking about, even if he's kind of old," said left guard Vlad Ducasse, adding that he learned just today that a lineman doesn't have to wait for a defensive player to touch him before attempting to block. "I never thought about pad level before, but it seems pretty important. We also worked on doing this pass-blocking stance where we bend our knees and keep our backs straight and lift up our arms. It's hard because it feels more natural and less tiring to just let your arms hang at your side." Although a few Jets offensive linemen said they were learning valuable skills and techniques that could help improve their careers, the majority agreed that pass blocking wasn't for them.
