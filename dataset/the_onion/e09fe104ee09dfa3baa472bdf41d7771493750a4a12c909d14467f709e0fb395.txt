SAN FRANCISCO--Saying love could be as close as a neighbor or colleague you've never once found yourself remotely interested in, new dating website OnSecondThought.com launched this week with a promise to pair users with people they already know but thought they were too good for. "On Second Thought uses a compatibility formula unlike any other site, drawing your personalized matches exclusively from those within your daily life who you've always considered beneath you," said founder Layla Mufti, adding that the site's easy-to-use interface allows members to get another look at the network of people they've written off in the past for not being attractive, intelligent, interesting, polite, active, hygienic, or stable enough to meet their standards. "One day you might get paired with someone from work who you've always regarded as mediocre-looking and kind of dumb, while the next it could be a friend of a friend whose annoying Twitter feed you muted. Our algorithm is designed to help you see a person you've always found unappealing as your next romantic partner--at this point, why not?" While Mufti expressed her hope to see the site grow, she said the true measure of its success will be the number of short-lived marriages it spawns.
