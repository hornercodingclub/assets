Scientists from the University of California-Riverside announced they have rediscovered a bumblebee that was last seen in 1956. What do think? "Talk to me about honey. How much of it is there and how sweet? With bees that's all I want to know." Alex Marsh * Oxidizer "Two questions immediately arise. First, why were they so elusive for so long?

They were trapped between my screen door and front door for a few decades, and I just recently got up the nerve to let the angry things out." Janel Savage * Retired
