RIO DE JANEIRO--After suffering a crushing defeat to Germany in Sunday's World Cup final, visibly emotional Argentina star Lionel Messi offered a heartfelt apology to all of his fellow compatriots in Barcelona. "To everyone back home in Barcelona: I'm sorry I couldn't win it for you," Messi told reporters, adding that he had hoped to parade the hallowed World Cup trophy through the streets of Catalonia. "It was always my dream to win this honor for my people, but I gave absolutely everything I had on the field and just fell short. Even in defeat, I can honestly say I've never felt more proud to be Catalan." Sources close to Messi later confirmed his private fear that after his disappointing performance in the final, he will never be able to show his face in Catalonia again.
