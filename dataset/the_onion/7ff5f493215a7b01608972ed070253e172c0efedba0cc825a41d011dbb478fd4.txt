TRENTON, NJ--In an astonishing moment of creative inspiration, local Twitter user Chase Munson, 29, told reporters Monday that his latest idea for a tweet had simply popped into his head all at once, almost fully composed. "I was driving back from the store, and it just came to me out of nowhere, nearly word for word--the whole tweet!" said Munson, adding that the rapidly conceived-of tweet arrived in his mind complete with an appropriate hashtag and fell well within the social media site's 140-character limit. "I mean, it was all there, the whole thing. A finished work. It was amazing." At press time, sources confirmed Munson's masterpiece had been "favorited" by two of his friends.
