ORLANDO, FL--More than a year after Casey Anthony was acquitted of her daughter's murder, the Florida sheriff's office that investigated the case admitted Monday that it had overlooked a key piece of evidence: a discussion thread Anthony posted on the social news site Reddit titled "I killed my daughter AMA." "I am Casey Anthony, a 22-year-old mom who just murdered her 2-year-old daughter and hid her body in the woods. Ask me anything!" read an introductory bio at the top of the June 16, 2008 thread, in which Anthony responded in detail to users' questions about how she knocked her child unconscious with chloroform before suffocating her with duct tape and attempting to cover up the incriminating evidence. "I'll be on here for the next couple hours, happy to talk about any part of my experience and share tips, especially if you're thinking about doing this yourself. I'm an open book!" Investigators confirmed that Anthony's post about how to properly stash your dead daughter's corpse in a trash bag and store it in the trunk of your car received more than 500 up-votes.
