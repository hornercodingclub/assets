A self-described reformed white supremacist in Montana claims to have founded a new Ku Klux Klan chapter called the Rocky Mountain Knights that will promote diversity by accepting Jews, black people, and homosexuals. What do think? "This sort of wishy-washy crap is the reason no one takes the Klan seriously any more." Mike Litherland * Hotel Towel Changer "I guess going on a one-man quest to reform the KKK is still easier than having to get all those tattoos removed." Lorraine Nichols * Brooch Designer "As the father of a gay son who has been denied knighthood for years, I say this is too little too late." Dennis Boyer * Solar Energy Lobbyist
