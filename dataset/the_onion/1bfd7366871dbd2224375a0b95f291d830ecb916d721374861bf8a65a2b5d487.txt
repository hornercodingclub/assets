INDIANAPOLIS--Asserting that the tenacious athletes are prepared to tough it out just as they have in recent years, officials confirmed Wednesday that thousands of collegiate football players are expected to play through the upcoming season with a badly broken NCAA system. "Though these guys are struggling to perform with a system that is barely functional at this point, it's a testament to their resiliency and heart that they'll be suiting up for us this year," NCAA president Mark Emmert told reporters, emphasizing that the players are prepared to give it their all despite telltale symptoms of a fractured athletic association further compounded by a totally unstable compensation structure. "Given the severity of the situation, a lot of people don't think these guys should even be taking the field in the first place, but I'm confident that they'll be able to play through it. Obviously at some point we're going to have to just go in there and completely rebuild it. The good news, at least, is that the damage can't possibly get any worse." Emmert added that in the event that playing with a broken NCAA system leads to any career-ending injuries, the athletes are easily replaceable.
