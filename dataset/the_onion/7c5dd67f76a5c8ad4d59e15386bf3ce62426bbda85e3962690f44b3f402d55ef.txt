CLEVELAND--Taking a "wait-and-see" approach before becoming too emotionally invested in this year's team, cautious Browns fan Murray Fields told reporters Friday that he wasn't expecting the franchise to finish better than 13-3 this regular season. "I know some of my friends expect the Browns to have a great year, but we have been burned so many times in the past that I can't set my expectations any higher than home-field advantage throughout the playoffs," said Fields, 35, revealing he will consider the season a success even if the team loses the AFC Championship Game. "Is this roster exciting? Yeah. Could Baker Mayfield throw for 5,000 yards? Sure. But I'm trying to stay grounded. I don't want to be heartbroken at the end of the year when we've only won 12 games and swept our division rivals. I know 16-0 is a real possibility, but I would just say I'm cautiously optimistic." Fields added that even with their current talent he felt like the Browns were still a year or two away from a five Super Bowl dynasty.
