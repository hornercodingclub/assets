WASHINGTON--NBA analyst Bruce Bowen reportedly suggested Friday that openly gay free agent center Jason Collins just might be the perfect frontcourt presence for a team needing to instantly boost media coverage. "Jason Collins is a savvy, veteran center who can immediately contribute to increasing a team's public visibility," said Bowen, adding that the 34-year-old homosexual basketball player really shines in the middle of press conferences. "Collins would be a great pickup for teams like the Milwaukee Bucks or Sacramento Kings that are lacking a big man who can dominate in the postgame interview." Bowen acknowledged that signing Collins would be potentially risky, claiming that the move would significantly hurt any team's depth at center.
