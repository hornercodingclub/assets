JOPLIN, MO--Expressing frustration over being "hounded nonstop," 28-year-old junior analyst Harrison Jacobsen complained to reporters Wednesday that his boss at Baines Marketing has been all over his ass about completing his NCAA March Madness bracket. "Brad's been riding me all week about this damn thing," Jacobsen said of his supervisor, who has reportedly checked in several times a day to keep track of his progress on entering a bracket into the office's ESPN.com tournament pool. "The deadline isn't even until tomorrow, so I don't get why he's getting all bent out of shape about it. It's like, 'Get off my fucking case, man. I'll get it done.'" At press time, Jacobsen had filled out his bracket in 30 seconds by picking completely random teams.
