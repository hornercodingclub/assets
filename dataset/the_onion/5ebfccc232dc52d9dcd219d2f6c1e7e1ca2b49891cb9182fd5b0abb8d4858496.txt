NEW YORK--With the 2014 NFL Draft less than a month away, sources confirmed Tuesday that GMs from across the league are closely studying a Bleacher Report slideshow titled "Ranking The Top 100 NFL Draft Prospects" before making their final decisions. "Dammit, we had [University of Michigan offensive tackle Taylor] Lewan going top 10, but we must have missed something at the combine, because he's ranked 17th on here," said Baltimore Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome, frantically rearranging the team's draft board while paging through the slideshow. "See this? [Vanderbilt wide receiver] Jordan Matthews 'can get open and just seems to find the ball'--forget everybody else, we have to take this guy first round. Christ, why the hell weren't we able to find out this info from our scouting reports?" At press time, Newsome had decided to scrap the team's potential selections entirely after coming across a new mock draft posted on FanSided.com.
