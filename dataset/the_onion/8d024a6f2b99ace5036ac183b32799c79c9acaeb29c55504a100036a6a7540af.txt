CLEVELAND--21-year-old LeBron James, who skipped college to make millions of dollars in the National Basketball Association, was amazed to find out that someone his very own age, Case Western Reserve University junior Michael Washington, had the ability to stay up all night studying for a physics exam, which he later aced. "This kid's natural study skills are unbelievable," said James, who learned later that Washington is the youngest person in his family to attend college. "What he can do in the academic arena at his age is something that I could only dream of." James was equally impressed with Washington's ability to live in his 12-foot-by-19-foot dorm room, saying that he couldn't even imagine living like that at this point in his life.
