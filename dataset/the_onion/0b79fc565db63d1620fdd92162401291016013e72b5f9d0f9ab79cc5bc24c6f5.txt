Reverend Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr., the former pastor of presidential candidate Barack Obama, has been blasted for controversial statements he made to his congregation. What are some of the remarks he's under fire for? "Elvis is not dead and will make a reappearance in order to steal rap music from black people." "Hurricane Katrina was created in a Pentagon weather laboratory." "The current administration is fallible." "Justin Guarini was voted into the finale for being part white, but was then voted off for being part black." "Nobody ever gets tired of eating bologna, am I right?" "God loves each and every one of us." "Stanley Kubrick could have done a better job casting ." "Maybe it's just me, but it doesn't feel like black people are always treated as equals to whites."
