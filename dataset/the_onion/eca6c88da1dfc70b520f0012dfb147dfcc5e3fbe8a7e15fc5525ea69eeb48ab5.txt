CHICAGO--The career of 26-year-old running back Matt Forte was tragically cut short Monday after Forte succumbed to a career-ending contract with the Chicago Bears. "It's such a shame to see such a promising young talent fall victim to a multi-year deal with the Bears," said ESPN's John Clayton, adding that he had to look away when Forte announced the painful signing. "We've unfortunately seen this fate befall so many players through the years and while some of them try to recover, after a few years spent battling with a Bears contract, nobody is ever the same." History has shown the effects of signing with Chicago has proven particularly harmful to running backs, with former Bears Cedric Benson, Curtis Enis, Rashaan Salaam and a host of others reaching out to express their sympathies to Forte.
