PHOENIX--After hearing his name in myriad trade rumors, Phoenix Suns forward Amar'e Stoudemire revealed Wednesday that, nearly two months after the NBA trade deadline, he is still trying to figure out which team he should currently be playing for. "I'm guessing I'm a Cavalier now, but maybe it doesn't take effect until next season," Stoudemire said following a game in which he led the Suns with 20 points. "Am I on the Nets and they just haven't told me yet? I've never been traded before so I don't really know how this works. Please, say I'm not a Net." Stoudemire added that, whichever team he is on, he's looking forward to sticking it to his Suns ex-teammates during the playoffs.
