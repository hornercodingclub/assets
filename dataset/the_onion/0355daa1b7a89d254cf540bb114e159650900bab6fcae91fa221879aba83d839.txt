BALTIMORE, MD--Hoping to give the still-developing prospect more time to find his game, the Norfolk Tides announced Wednesday that third-baseman Anderson Feliz would be sent down to the Baltimore Orioles. "Feliz has been dealing with a couple of injuries and he's had a little bit of a slump, so we think this will be a good way to build up his confidence," said Tides manager Gary Kendall, explaining that Feliz would be spending a season "working on the fundamentals" with the Baltimore squad until he'd worked his way up to the level of play consistent with AAA ball. "I know he's disappointed right now to be leaving for Baltimore, but in the end, it'll be for the best. He shouldn't take this too hard because we consider him a big part of the future of the Tides. Right now, he's a little over his head, but he'll fit right in with the Orioles. And after another season, he should be ready to move on to bigger and better things." Kendall went on to add that he was glad Feliz at least got some time with the Tides, as it might have been too big an ego hit to have him start for the Orioles on opening day.
