Physicists in the U.K. have isolated a naturally occurring protein in ice cream that binds together water, air, and fat content to keep the scoop solid, a protein they can replicate and use to develop ice cream that doesn't melt.

Les Tackett * Baseball Stitcher "I admit it would be nice to eat ice cream year-round and not just during winter." Loretta Suskin * Montage Curator
