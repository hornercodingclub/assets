DETROIT--Reports from Lions practice this week indicate a growing sense of concern over head coach Jim Schwartz's decision to continue managing the team despite exhibiting a variety of concussion-like symptoms. "Between his inability to concentrate, confused demeanor, and extreme irritability, he shows all the signs of having suffered a traumatic brain injury," said head trainer Dr. Rick Holloway, adding that Schwartz's slurred speech and typically blank expression further suggest that at some point the coach was subjected to a violent blow to the head. "At times he seems to lack total situational awareness and often does not appear to understand what is being asked of him. Frankly, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of him going out there and leading the team like that, but unfortunately there's no rule in place that says I can stop him." When asked to comment, Schwartz reportedly insisted he feels fine and is more than prepared to coach his team to a victory over the Arizona Cardinals.
