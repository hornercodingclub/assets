WASHINGTON--Wizards assistant coach and former Houston Rockets guard Sam Cassell reportedly phoned his agent and several NBA front offices Monday inquiring if he could "get in on" the potential three-team deal that would send Carmelo Anthony to the New Jersey Nets. "Looks like there's a lot of guys included, so maybe I can just slide on in there," Cassell, 41, wrote in an e-mail to NBA commissioner David Stern. "Doesn't matter where I end up--Detroit, Denver, New Jersey--I'm not picky. Just, you know, make a little roster space for good old Uncle Sam is all I'm asking. What's the worst that could happen?" At press time, Cassell was constantly refreshing his e-mail awaiting a response from Stern.
