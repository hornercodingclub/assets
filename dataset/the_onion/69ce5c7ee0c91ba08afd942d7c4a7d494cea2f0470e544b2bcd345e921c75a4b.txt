DALLAS--Admiring the personal protective equipment shielding her caregivers from the deadly virus, a nurse receiving treatment for Ebola told reporters Monday that she was very impressed with the medical workers' newly issued biohazard gear. "Wow, I only had the flimsy gown that exposed several inches around my neck, but this guy's decked out in a really nice full-body suit that covers everything," said the infected nurse, who was particularly taken by the updated gear's sealed hood, large apron, rubber boots, and second pair of surgical gloves, which are now recommended by the CDC for all hospital staffers treating patients exposed to the disease. "Sure, the surgical mask I had seemed great at the time, but the brand-new breathing pack and air filtration system my nurse was using really take the cake. It's cool to be one of the first people to see this high-tech equipment." The nurse confirmed she was most impressed with the new protocols for removing the biohazard gear, which reportedly involved more than tossing the protective clothing in the hospital's laundry bin.
