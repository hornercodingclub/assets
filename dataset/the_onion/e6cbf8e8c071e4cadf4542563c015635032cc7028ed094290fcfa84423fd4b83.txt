RICHMOND, VA--Sources at the downtown Whole Foods location reported this afternoon that one of the grocery store's salad bar patrons apparently felt compelled to mutter the name of each vegetable and fixing under his breath as he picked it up and placed it in his plastic container. "Romaine...carrots...a little cucumber...no black olives...some scallions..." the tong-wielding man reportedly said in a soft but audible voice as he moved from vegetable tray to vegetable tray alongside several other customers. "Hmm, dressing, which dressing? Ooh, balsamic." Sources reported that the man later said the words "no" and "yes" aloud at checkout when the credit card terminal screen asked him whether he wanted cash back and to verify the transaction's $7.48 total.
