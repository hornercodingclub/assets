WASHINGTON--A report released Monday by the National Sleep Foundation revealed that most Major League Baseball players swallow as many as six baseballs per year while sleeping. "As baseball players, they tend to be around baseballs more often, so it's only natural that they come in oral contact with them while sleeping, swallowing more of them than the average person," said sleep expert and lead author of the report Dr. James Lowman, adding that swallowing a regulation-sized baseball here and there "isn't going to kill anyone." "Some players become distressed when they find out about all the baseballs they swallow, but there's really no cause for concern. It's not until you start swallowing 20 baseballs a year, or two baseballs at once, that you need to start thinking abut seeking help." Lowman, who also said that Prince Fielder sought treatment for swallowing several baseball gloves and a batting helmet earlier this year, disclosed that the Brewers first baseman was awake at the time.
