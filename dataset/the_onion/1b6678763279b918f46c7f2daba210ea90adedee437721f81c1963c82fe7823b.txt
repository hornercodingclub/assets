HARRISBURG, PA--Feeling uncommonly alert and rested, local web designer Michael Schlesinger reported Monday that his entire workday had been thrown off after receiving eight hours of undisturbed sleep. "Man, I feel completely focused and full of energy--it's really disorienting," said Schlesinger, adding that he had to pause and regroup himself several times this morning as his active thinking and sharpened senses allowed him to work through several tasks with unfamiliar efficiency. "My body has felt totally rejuvenated and my mind's been so clear since the moment I got up this morning. I just have to try to deal with it and make it through the day." Schlesinger said he planned to drink several cups of coffee in hopes of getting back to his usual distracted and edgy self.
