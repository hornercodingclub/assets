BOSTON--Speculating there is "a big clubhouse way up at the top of the sky," Boston Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz reportedly expressed his curiosity Thursday over what happens to players after they retire. "Is there anything after that, or are you just gone forever?" said the 38-year-old designated hitter, adding that he sincerely hopes retirement "doesn't hurt too bad." "Do you get to see all your friends who retired? Man, my best friend Jason Vortex [sic] retired a few whiles ago, and I was really sad, but maybe I can see him again someday. I just hope I've been good enough to end up somewhere nice--I don't want to be in the bad place for players who weren't good." After a period of noticeable anxiety, Ortiz then reportedly calmed down and assured himself that players generally only retire when they are "really old and can't hit the ball anymore."
