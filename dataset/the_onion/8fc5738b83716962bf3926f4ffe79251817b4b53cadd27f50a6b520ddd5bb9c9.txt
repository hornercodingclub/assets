TAMPA BAY, FL--Calling the 10,000-gallon habitat hallowed ground, a local stingray told reporters Monday that he dreams of one day making it to the Tropicana Field touch tank. "Ever since I was a pup, I've always imagined what it would be like to earn a spot in that 35-foot tank just beyond right-center field," said the adolescent cownose ray, adding that he would like nothing more than to one day hear the roar of the crowd from behind the glass as he flips his tail and burrows into the sand. "It'd be such a thrill to finally rub my flaps along the tank wall as I circle around waiting for my meal. There's not a day that goes by when I'm not working toward finally swimming through that tank while fans run their hands along my back." The stingray then added that making it to the Tropicana Tank would finally fulfill the dreams of his late father, who never made it beyond the Tampa Bay Airport RumFish Grill aquarium.
