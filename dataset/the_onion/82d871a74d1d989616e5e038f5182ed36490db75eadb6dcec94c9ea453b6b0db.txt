NEW YORK--The MLB All-Star festivities ended on a high note Monday as Detroit Tigers first baseman Prince Fielder wowed fans with his dominant performance in the league's annual Home Run-Eating Contest. "I saw the hunger in his eyes when he stepped up to the plate, but I never imagined he'd be able to eat that many dingers in one sitting," said anchor Chris Berman, noting Fielder's grueling regimen, which culminated in the consumption of 40 singles and 30 doubles on Sunday, followed by a 24-hour fasting period leading up to the event. "He really looked like he was about to burst after the tenth or eleventh double-decker, so to see him power through the pain and shatter his own record of 35 round trippers in 50 minutes was that much more impressive." Fielder's current pace of four-baggers ingested during the regular season has led to speculation that he might be the first MLB player to eat 800 home runs.
