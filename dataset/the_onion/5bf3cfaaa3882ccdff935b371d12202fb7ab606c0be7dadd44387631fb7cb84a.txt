Videos are surfacing online of people going into Apple stores and trying to bend the new iPhone 6 Plus to prove that it's possible, drawing criticism from internet commenters accusing them of being idiots. What do think? "I can't believe people would just walk into an Apple store and start breaking things like it's a Best Buy." Spencer Cobb * Concertmaster "If Apple didn't want people to abuse its products in idiotic ways, it shouldn't have placed them where the American consumer could reach them." Leanne Nolan * Air Show Coordinator "I just hope Apple can bounce back from this." Robby Greiner * Collectibles Appraiser
