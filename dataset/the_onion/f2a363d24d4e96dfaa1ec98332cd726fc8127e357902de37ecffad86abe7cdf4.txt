PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA--As 94-year-old Nelson Mandela remains hospitalized in critical condition, family members decided to go ahead and tell the former South African president that racism had finally ended, sources confirmed Sunday. "Just last night, all the races of the world reconciled with one another and agreed to live together in harmony," Mandela's wife Graca Machel reportedly said to the bedridden global icon, adding that the despicable institution of racism was "unlikely to have any further negative impact on the world." "Citizens everywhere have united to fight against any government policy that perpetuates intolerance, and all efforts are being made to live by the social doctrine that all people, regardless of race or gender, are created equal. You did it, Madiba! You did it." Family members then told Mandela that they "saw no end in sight" to Africa's pervasive AIDS epidemic.
