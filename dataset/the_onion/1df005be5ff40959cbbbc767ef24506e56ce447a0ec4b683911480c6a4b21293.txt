The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that its recent anti-smoking ad campaign, which shows actual people who have suffered disease, paralysis, and amputations as a result of tobacco use, has been more successful than anticipated. What do think? "I don't think it's fair that the anti-smoking people can show all of the horrible consequences of smoking, but the tobacco companies can no longer show how cool it makes you look." Brigid Randolph * Food Truck Proprietor "Big improvement over their last campaign, where they just concentrated on how good each cigarette tasted." Michael Calvino * Jailer "Oh my God, you've seen those too? My favorite is the woman who lost a bunch of her fingers! What's yours?" Robyn Pouch * Medical Voucher Clerk
