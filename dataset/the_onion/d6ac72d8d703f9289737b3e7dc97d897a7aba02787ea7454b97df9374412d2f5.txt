At a recent charity event in Dubai, a burger containing seven beef patties, aged cheddar, and veal bacon strips on a saffron brioche bun was auctioned off for $10,000. What do think? How can a $10,000 burger not include mushrooms?" Tricia Sniffen * Canvas Stretcher "This guy got ripped off. Jack In The Box just sold me four hamburgers, nine tacos, and a gallon of Sprite for $6.50." Gordy Welter * Wire Coiler "I'd rather eat $10,000 worth of normal burgers, thank you very much."
