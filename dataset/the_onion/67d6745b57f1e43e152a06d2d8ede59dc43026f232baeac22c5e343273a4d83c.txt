WASHINGTON--Expressing dissatisfaction with the current course the country is taking, voters across the nation told reporters Monday that they are eager to use next month's midterm elections to help put the United States back on a different wrong track. "We've been going down the wrong path for the past few years, and now it's time to get some new people in there who can lead our country astray in a different direction," said North Carolina voter Lisa Berkland, adding that Washington D.C. needed an influx of new misguided politicians with their own terrible visions for the country to change the manner in which the nation is veering off course. "It will take a lot of work to turn the country around and ensure a different type of horrible future, but I believe there are candidates out there who have the awful principles and ideologies to march into Washington and do it." According to recent polls, the majority of Americans believe they can have the biggest influence over changing the wrong direction of the country by not voting.
