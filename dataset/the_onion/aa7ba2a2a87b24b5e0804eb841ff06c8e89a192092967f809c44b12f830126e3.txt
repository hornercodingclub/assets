CLEVELAND--While recognizing that he and the junior senator from Florida share a similar ethnic background, 12-year-old Hispanic boy Damon Aguilar admitted to reporters Tuesday that he doesn't really know whether he's supposed to be looking up to Marco Rubio or not. "I don't know, should I try to be like Marco Rubio when I grow up? Is he the model I should be aspiring to?" said Aguilar, adding that Rubio may look like he does, but only when compared to all the other members of the U.S. Senate. "I guess he's given some pretty big speeches, but I don't know if I'm supposed to be impressed with that or what. It's not as if my parents or teachers have ever told me, 'Hey, if you work really hard, maybe someday you could be the next Marco Rubio.'" Aguilar later told reporters that as far as role models go, Hispanic-looking Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra would probably be a far safer pick.
