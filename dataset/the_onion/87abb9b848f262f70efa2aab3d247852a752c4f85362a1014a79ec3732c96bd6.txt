RUTHERFORD, NJ--Despite the doubts of many football fans, media figures, and people within the Jets organization itself, the New York Jets have indeed finished their entire 2005-2006 season. "We might have lost 12 games, our coach, and possibly our starting quarterback," said GM Terry Bradway, who called the season a "qualified success" in a subdued press conference Tuesday. "But in spite of everything, we fielded a team that played 16 regular-season NFL games. There are only 31 other teams out there who can say the same thing." Bradway would not comment on whether the Jets would be able to complete future seasons, saying that, for now, team management was concentrating on making it through all seven rounds of the NFL draft.
