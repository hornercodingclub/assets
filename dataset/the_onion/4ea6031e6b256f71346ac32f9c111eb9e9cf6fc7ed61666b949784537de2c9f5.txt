NEW YORK--In a postgame press conference Sunday, Giants quarterback Eli Manning told reporters that second is his favorite of all the downs. "There's too much pressure on first down, and third down--that's the worst down, because people get mad when you mess up your last chance," said Manning, adding that he does not often think about fourth down, but when he does, he "does not like it." "On second down, there's not so much pressure. You can just hang out in the pocket and do what you want without people yelling. I wish every down was second down." Manning later added that his other favorite down is actually when the opposing team has second down, because that's when literally nothing is expected of him.
