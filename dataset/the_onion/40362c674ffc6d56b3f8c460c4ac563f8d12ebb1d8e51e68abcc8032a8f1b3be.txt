LOS ANGELES--Telling reporters Monday he felt significant pressure to ensure the project lived up to the high expectations of people around the world, screenwriter Michael Wilder, who is currently adapting the board game Candy Land into a full-length feature film, is reportedly under the impression fans are counting on him to get this right. "Millions of people are depending on me to make this movie great; if I don't capture the essence of what everyone loves about Candy Land, I'll never be able to live it down," said Wilder, who stated that fans have been waiting years for the game to appear as a major motion picture and that he could not betray their trust by botching the protagonists' climactic confrontation with Lord Licorice. "I know how much Candy Land means to people, so I'd better deliver a satisfying and faithful retelling of the heroes' journey through the Peppermint Forest and Gumdrop Mountains. If I don't nail iconic characters like Gramma Nutt and Gloppy, I don't even want to think of how disappointed and angry fans will be." Wilder added that beyond meeting fans' high standards, he also had to craft a compelling ending that would build excitement for the three planned sequels.
