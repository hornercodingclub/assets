PROVIDENCE, RI--Sources attending a house party on Governor Street confirmed that the dude with the knit hat has been referring to the supply of beer as "libations" throughout the night. "The night is young, my friends--enough libations for everyone," said the guy whose sideburns poked out from beneath the wool cap and whose name may have been Jordan or Jay--or possibly Kyle--before raising his red plastic cup to eye level, nodding his head slightly, and urging the assembled partygoers to "imbibe." "We've got some fine spirits in the kitchen, too, if anyone's interested." The dude, who also wore tight brown corduroy pants, then reportedly circulated among the partygoers, describing his recent "unreal" trip to Colorado.
