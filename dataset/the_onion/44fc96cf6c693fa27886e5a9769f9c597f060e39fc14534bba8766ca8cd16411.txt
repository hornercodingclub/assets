So, my despised arch-enemy and rival in the news-paper trade William Randolph Hearst thinks he can single-handedly stop dead in its tracks by putting that vulgar "Yellow-Kid" comical drawing panel in his ? Yes, I've heard all of your complaints: "Can't have its own humorous picture joke stories too?" "We demand funny hand-drawn sequential exploits of New-York slum-urchins and mischievous German children!" The answer is no! A thousand times no! leads, it does not follow! I have steadfastly refused to drag the hallowed American journalism tradition through the gutter to pander to your base and prurient tastes! Save for this, a one-time-only exception. I charged 's staff illustrator and chief engraver to fashion a response to the Yellow-Kid, entitled "The Onion-Kid," which is visible below. They had the temerity to suggest it be garishly colored, but I blasted the notion out of the water. Color belongs on a prostitute's rouge-stained face, not in a news-gathering forum! And this, dear readers, marks the first and final time I shall ever appease the ignorant masses with low-brow amusement. This is not magazine! After all, if I were to fill with trivial comedic diversions, where would I run the robber barons' press-releases, or the advertisements? Oh, and while I am on the subject, I also refuse to print any of those puzzles made up of bisecting blank boxes, in which the reader must guess what words fit in the boxes based upon a number of arcane clues. If you want fun and games, go to Coney Island!
