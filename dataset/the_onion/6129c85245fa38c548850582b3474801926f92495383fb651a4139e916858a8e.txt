LAS VEGAS host Stuart Scott reportedly straightened his shirt collar, tugged twice on the lapels of his sport jacket, smoothed out his eyebrows, and told onlookers to "watch the master" before attempting to gain entry for himself and his colleagues to a party hosted by former NBA All-Star Charles Barkley. "This is how it's done, young'uns," Scott was overheard telling fellow anchors Mike Greenberg and Rece Davis, adding that "when Chuck realizes he almost made Stuart Scott and his peeps wait in line, we'll drink free all night." "Hope you fellas are ready to party." Greenburg and Davis said Scott offered no explanation as to why they were allowed entry to the party while Scott, who attempted to call their cell phones from the parking lot several times before apparently leaving two hours later, was not.
