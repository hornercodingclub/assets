LAS VEGAS--As expected, Wednesday night's ESPN awards culminated in a win for the recreational competitive activity 'Sports' in the Best Thing category, soundly beating perennial runners-up Girls, Food and Beverages, and Consumer Electronics for the 11th consecutive year and 18th year overall. "It was really great to hand the award over to Sports, which as you know has only lost once, to Steak with Mashed Potatoes in 2000," said George Bodenheimer, president of ESPN Inc, who went on to add that being a 'Sports' fan himself was one of the main reasons he agreed to produce the ESPYs. "Of course, that was a bad year for sports, and a really good one for steak." Sports could not attend the award ceremony in person, but arranged for former professional basketball player Michael Jordan to accept the trophy because of his strong, 40-year relationship with sports.
