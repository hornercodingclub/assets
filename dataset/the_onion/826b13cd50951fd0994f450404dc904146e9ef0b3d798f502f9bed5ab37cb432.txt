CHICAGO--Noting that he immediately knew something was wrong, Bulls point guard Derrick Rose confirmed Friday that there's a pretty good chance he just tore his ACL by casually glancing at his knee. "I was sitting down on the couch and absentmindedly looked down for a split second, and that's when I heard a loud and was suddenly in excruciating pain," said Rose, adding that he felt the ligament snap the moment his knee came into his line of sight. "I wasn't even really looking at the knee, per se--my eyes just sort of passed over it, and then I felt it go. I should probably get an MRI just to be sure, but it's already swelled to twice its normal size, so I'm pretty positive I tore it." At press time, Rose had also reportedly torn his PCL and MCL after thinking the word "knee."
