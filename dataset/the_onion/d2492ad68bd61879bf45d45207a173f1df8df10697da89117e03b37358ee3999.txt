BOSTON--Expressing deep disappointment as their beloved series begins to come to a long-awaited conclusion, crestfallen fans reported Monday their realization that the show is never going to show dragons fucking. "I've put hundreds of hours of my life into this series, and now it seems it's all been a waste," said self-described "superfan" Aaron Tremaine, 31, recounting how his initial excitement at the beginning of each new season shifted to sadness after being repeatedly deprived of steamy dragon-on-dragon sex. "Of course, I didn't expect it to happen in the very first scene of the pilot, but I figured it had to happen eventually. They spent so many episodes building up the whole 'will-they-won't-they' tension with Drogon and Rhaegal, and now it seems like it's never going to pay off. It's devastating, especially as I'm told it's such a big part of the books." Tremaine, like many fans of the show, remains optimistic that the final episodes may include some dragon oral sex or "at least some claw stuff."
