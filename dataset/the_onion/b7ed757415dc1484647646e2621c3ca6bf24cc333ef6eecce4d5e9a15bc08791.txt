ATLANTA--Taking a timeout during the third inning of Tuesday's game against the Marlins, Braves left fielder Justin Upton reportedly realized he'd been at bat for more than four hours. "Man, how long have I been up here?" Upton was overheard muttering after fouling off 437 consecutive full-count pitches from eight different Marlins pitchers. "It's getting fairly dark outside, my shoulders are really starting to ache, and the fans are starting to leave. I mean, I get that it's important to be patient and wait for the right pitch, but this is taking fucking forever." At press time, the inning had ended as Jason Heyward was caught stealing second.
