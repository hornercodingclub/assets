CHAPPAQUA, NY--Saying it would provide a candid account of her experiences writing an unsuccessful tell-all, sources confirmed Thursday that Hillary Clinton is already working on a follow-up book casting blame for the failures of her previous memoir . "From my agent negotiating that underwhelming deal with Simon & Schuster, to the graphic designer's lackluster cover art, to my so-called supporters who couldn't be bothered to drop $17.99 for the hardcover copy--everyone had a hand in undermining my last book's success," reads a passage from the introduction to Clinton's , which repeatedly decries her prior book's "indecipherable" font and dedicates an entire chapter to lashing out at her copy editor for making her look like "an idiot third-grader." "I'll never forget how Amazon buried me and how Barnes & Noble completely sabotaged me by displaying my book way in the back in that no man's land by the CDs. Frankly, it's obvious I got screwed on all sides." Accusing them of stealing her spotlight, the book reportedly concludes with a long list of every other celebrity who published a memoir in the past year.
