On the heels of a Super Bowl win two years ago and a 15-1 season last year, the Green Bay Packers take a disappointing 2-3 record into their week-six matchup against the unbeaten Houston Texans. What do think? "Yeah, it's disappointing they don't look as bad as that Super Bowl team from two years ago that started 3-3." "The Packers are just one solid running back, two defensive ends, three linebackers, two cornerbacks, one safety, one left tackle, one right tackle, and one left guard away from being a Super Bowl contender again." "It's a shame that they're in a league where no team could possibly come back from a slow start to win a championship."
