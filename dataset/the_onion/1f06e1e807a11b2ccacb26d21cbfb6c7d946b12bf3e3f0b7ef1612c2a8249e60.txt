NEWPORT, VA--Struggling to maintain their composure as they gathered on the main quad, dozens of administrators from Coleman College held a candlelight vigil Monday to honor Robert Carlson, a highly respected donor who was lost in a mishandled campus rape case earlier this month. "Robert had such a tremendous impact on this community; it's so awful to have lost him in such a senseless way," said university president Allen Brown, who, after lamenting the school's inadequate investigation and ensuing cover-up of a student's sexual assault that led to Carlson's passing from the annual donor rolls, proceeded to lead the crowd in a brief moment of silence. "This heartbreaking tragedy has had a devastating effect on every one of us--something like this should never, ever happen here. I can honestly say that this school will not be the same without him." At press time, a teary-eyed Brown could be seen holding hands with other campus officials, emphasizing that everyone must truly cherish the time they have with their donors before it's too late.
