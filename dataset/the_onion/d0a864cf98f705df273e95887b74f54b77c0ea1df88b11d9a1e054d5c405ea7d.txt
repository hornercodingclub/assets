RIO DE JANEIRO--Spotting the wide-eyed athletes waiting near the Maracana Stadium exit, Simone Biles reportedly threw one of her gold medals to the adoring U.S. men's gymnastics team Sunday, encouraging the Olympians to "keep it." "Hey guys, catch," said Biles, tossing the gold medal to American gymnast Sam Mikulak, who clutched the award as his teammates stared in stunned disbelief with their mouths agape. "Take good care of that for me, okay?" At press time, the five athletes nervously stammered, "Thanks, Ms. Biles!" as the gymnast walked away.
