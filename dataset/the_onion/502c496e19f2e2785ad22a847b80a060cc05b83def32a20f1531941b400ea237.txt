Nick von Wernherr * Systems Analyst "The arguments center on whether the health care law's monetary penalty against the uninsured cannot be challenged due to an 1867 law stripping federal courts' jurisdiction in lawsuits intended to halt collection of a tax, but that's complicated, so just put me down as saying 'Nobamacare!'" Rachel Brady * Plaster Mixer "To be honest, these big hearings bore me. I like it better when the Supreme Court considers stuff like whether Kiss owes money to Vinnie Vincent."
