ATLANTA--Following the Seahawks' playoff loss to the Falcons, Seattle wide receiver Golden Tate reportedly insisted Sunday that he caught Russell Wilson's 48-yard desperation pass as time expired, claiming that the play should have been ruled a touchdown. "I had possession at the end. I absolutely did. I got in there under Julio Jones, I fought for the ball the whole way, and I came down with it," said Tate, adding that after briefly conferring at the back of the end zone, the referees "made the wrong call." "It's hard to tell because there's no perfect camera angle on the replay, but if you were there and you saw it up close, I clearly caught that ball. It was a legal catch." Pressed for further explanation, Tate claimed that while the pass was in the air, he slid inside Julio Jones's jersey, controlled the ball with two feet down, and then slid back out.
