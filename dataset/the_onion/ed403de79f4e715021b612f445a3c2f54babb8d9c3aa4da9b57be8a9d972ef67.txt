BRASILIA, BRAZIL--With the eyes of the entire world upon them, hundreds of the greatest soccer stars from across the globe have gathered in Brazil for what essentially amounts to a monthlong Coca-Cola ad, sources confirmed Tuesday. "This is a truly special event: the best players on the planet representing dozens of countries, all in one place to basically serve as Coca-Cola spokesmen," said ESPN soccer analyst Taylor Twellman, adding that a host of international superstars will be participating in the highly anticipated monthlong promotional campaign in which they will have their faces plastered on Diet Coke billboards and appear in commercials juggling a Coke can before catching it with one hand and taking a sip. "Millions of excited fans can watch their favorite players unite on the world's biggest stage and ultimately put on an elaborate four-week song and dance to sell a soft drink. And this incredible display of cross-branding only comes around every four years, so everyone can't wait for it to finally get started."  Reached for comment, notable players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, and Andres Iniesta all unanimously told reporters "Open Happiness" in over 20 languages.
