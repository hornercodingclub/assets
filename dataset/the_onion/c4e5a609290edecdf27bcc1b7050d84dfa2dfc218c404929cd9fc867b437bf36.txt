MINNEAPOLIS--In an effort to pay tribute to the influential pop star's legacy, the U.S. Postal Service unveiled a new line of commemorative Prince-inspired postal workers Friday. "Our latest series of limited-edition postal workers highlights all of Prince's legendary career, from his smoldering white-ruffled blouse and purple jumpsuit look in the mid-'80s to the more subdued tri-spectacled sunglasses, gold sleeveless silk kimono, and white turtleneck from ," said Postmaster General Megan Brennan, noting that the newly released set of two dozen USPS workers would feature tributes to Prince's life such as flowing black curls, metallic silver canes, and white lace uniforms incorporating the singer's iconic Love Symbol. "When our customers see their packages arriving in the hands of a blazer-and-scarf-bedecked mailman riding a -era Honda 400A motorcycle, they'll really see what makes these Forever Workers special. Frankly, there's no better way for Prince fans to send their mail in a freaky, get-down-and-get-nasty style." The new series of commemorative workers comes on the heels of USPS workers outfitted to honor such famous parts of American history as Elvis, Harvey Milk, and the Eastern tailed-blue butterfly.
