LOS ANGELES--Claiming that the name sounds plausible enough, sources confirmed Friday that there is most likely a collegiate athletic conference called the Coastal 10. "There's all sorts of conferences, so it seems reasonable to assume The Coastal 10 is made up of a bunch of schools somewhere on the West Coast," said 26-year-old college sports fan Patrick Solomon, who speculated that the hypothetical conference includes various universities with names like Central Valley Tech, Santa Monica State, and UC North Beach. "I bet it's a Division I conference, but most of their games aren't televised, so you'd have to see them on WatchESPN. And they probably get an at-large bid to the tournament every once in a while, too. Yeah, something like that." Reached for comment, NCAA president Mark Emmert confirmed that all of this sounds about right.
