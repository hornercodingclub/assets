WASHINGTON--Expressing profound disappointment upon learning the soccer star had been left off the U.S. World Cup roster by manager Jurgen Klinsmann, Americans across the country confirmed Thursday they will always have a fond, somewhat vague recollection of former captain Landon Donovan. "It's really sad that he won't be playing in Brazil, but I'll never forget how excited I was during the last World Cup when he scored that last-second goal to win the match--wait, that was him, right?" said 28-year-old Jared Molloy of Tampa Bay, FL, who like millions of Americans spent this week nostalgically reflecting on Donovan's long career playing for the national team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and wherever the one before that was. "Looking back, it's hard to imagine the U.S. team achieving much success without him out there, you know, doing all that stuff he did. He's definitely the greatest American player of all time." Molloy went on to say that without Donovan, the fate of the 2014 team will likely rest on the shoulders of that other guy who plays goalie.
