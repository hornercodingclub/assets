BOSTON--NBA analyst David Aldridge said Wednesday that with the addition of Shaquille O'Neal, the Celtics have vastly improved their chances of leading the league in three-second lane violations for the 2010-2011 season. "Not only does Shaq's presence in the paint give his team more opportunities to turn the ball over, but the Celtics have also added an experienced big man who makes an already old team significantly older," said Aldridge, adding that O'Neal should fill a key role in terms of drastically slowing down the Celtics' offense. "Danny Ainge was looking for someone with size who can't make it down to the other end of the court, and he went out and got the best in the business." Aldridge added that while O'Neal isn't the dominant force he once was, he believes Shaq still has a thing or two to teach teams who think it's a good idea to sign him.
