PITTSBURGH--Voicing stunned disbelief that the game has somehow lasted this long, exasperated sources at the University of Pittsburgh campus confirmed Tuesday that an intramural rugby match has been occupying Charles L. Cost Field for the last two fucking hours. "How the hell is this thing still going on? They've been going back and forth out there since noon," said 20-year-old onlooker Harrison Brier, who speculated that there must be some smaller version of the sport these assholes could play without hogging the entire field. "Oh, great, they're switching sides again. How many fucking quarters or whatever can rugby possibly have? Jesus Christ." At press time, several guys with a soccer ball were reportedly trotting onto the field while saying some shit about having it reserved.
