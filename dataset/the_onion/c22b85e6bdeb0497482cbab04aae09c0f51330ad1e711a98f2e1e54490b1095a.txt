HARLAN, KY--Stressing that he doesn't require anything fancy, local 3-year-old Jacob McCormick told reporters Friday that he is only looking to purchase a sensible mid-range tricycle. "All I need is a safe, reliable trike that can get me around the driveway without tipping over," said McCormick, adding that he didn't need bells and whistles like walkie-talkies or motorcycle-revving sound effects, and that he would be just fine with a comfortable seat, sturdy handlebars, and, if possible, a small compartment where he can store one or two action figures. "As long as it has three wheels and can get me from point A to point B on the sidewalk in front of our house, I'll be satisfied. I don't want any flashy colors either, so I'd be happy with a simple red or blue tricycle--not pink. Pink is for girls." At press time, while at Toys "R" Us with his parents, McCormick had decided to splurge on an all-black Lil Rider LED Space Traveler Trike for $79.99 and threw a tantrum when his mother told him he'd have to wait until his birthday a month from now.
