INDIANAPOLIS--Pointing out that Peyton has a big house in Indianapolis and that they never hang out together anymore, Eli Manning approached his brother Friday to ask if he could crash at his place when he's in town for the Super Bowl. "C'mon, man, I can just stay on the couch if the spare bedroom is really full of stuff," a brotherly e-mail from the Giants quarterback read in part. "C'mon, it'll be fun." Although Peyton Manning has reportedly not yet given Eli a definite answer, in his initial replies he has written, "I dunno, man, my place isn't really all THAT big," and "Oh, yeah, just remembered my dad is gonna be staying with me that week, so maybe no."
