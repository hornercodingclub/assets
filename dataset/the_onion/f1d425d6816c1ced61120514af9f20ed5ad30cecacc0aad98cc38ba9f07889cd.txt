NEW YORK--Responding to queries from fans hoping to attend the upcoming matchup between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons, the NFL announced Thursday that tickets to Super Bowl LI would only be made available for purchase one hour before kickoff at the NRG Stadium box office. "The box office will open right at 4:30 p.m. Central, at which time fans will be able to buy tickets from any one of the 12 box-office attendants outside the venue," NFL senior vice president of events Peter Reilly said in a statement, adding that the game's 72,720 available tickets will range from $25 for the arena's upper decks to $75 for premium seats closer to the field. "There will also be the opportunity to buy one of a limited number of box seats, which are all first-come, first-served. However, there are no more than four tickets of any kind allowed per customer, and fans should also keep in mind that all purchases will be cash-only." The statement concluded by advising any NFL sponsors hoping to buy seats to start lining up at least 15 minutes before the ticket gate opened, as the game is expected to sell out.
