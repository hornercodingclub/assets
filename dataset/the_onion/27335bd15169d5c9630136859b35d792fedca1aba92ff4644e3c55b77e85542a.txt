WASHINGTON--Gently applying a cool cloth to the plant's kernels as he cradled its frail stalk in his arms, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack stayed up all night caring for a sick corn plant, sources close to the former Iowa governor confirmed Tuesday. "There, there--you're going to be all right," the fretful cabinet member said as he stroked the plant's wilted leaves and browning tassels, feeding it spoonfuls of nourishing, nitrogen-rich fertilizer. "Be brave for me, little one. We're going to make sure you get all better." At press time, sources reported that a tearful but determined Vilsack had mercifully snapped the corncob in half to put the dying plant out of its misery.
