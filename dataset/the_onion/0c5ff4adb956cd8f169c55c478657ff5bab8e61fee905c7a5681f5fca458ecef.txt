NEW YORK--Touting it as a seductive and versatile new addition to their Dream Angels collection, Victoria's Secret officials announced Tuesday the launch of a 3-square-inch patch of satin that can be placed anywhere on the body. "Our new Ultimate Angel Patches are feminine, delicate, and incredibly sexy," said Victoria's Secret CEO Sharen Turney, who noted that the square piece of lace-trimmed fabric can be worn in over 50 different ways and comes in 10 styles and colors, including Leopard, Sheer, Beach Orchid, and Christmas Red with White Fur Trim. "The Ultimate Angel Patch can be placed anywhere that makes you feel sexy. It's intensely alluring on a tanned shoulder, draped over an elbow, or even worn on one ankle. Plus, your partner will absolutely love sensually taking it off of you." Turney confirmed that the 3-inch patch of satin would retail for $88.
