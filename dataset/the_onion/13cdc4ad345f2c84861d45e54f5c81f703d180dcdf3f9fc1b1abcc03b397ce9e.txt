LEICESTER, ENGLAND--After authenticating a skeleton exhumed from a parking lot in Northern England as that of British monarch King Richard III, researchers at the University of Leicester agreed that the find was "pretty cool" before tossing the remains back into the ground and heading home. "Okay, well, that's that--anyone want to keep one of these bones before I dump them?" said lead archaeologist Richard Buckley moments prior to dumping a bucket full of the well-preserved Plantagenet King's remains into a hole in the ground and brushing the dirt off his hands. "Everybody good? Okay. I'm glad we did this. This was fun." According to members of the research team, they planned on keeping a small sample of dirt from the gravesite "as a little keepsake."
