CHICAGO--A coalition of concerned NFL mothers held a press conference Friday, expressing their fears about the growing risk of binge drinking that occurs beneath the pile of players attempting to gain control of the loose ball. "There gets to be so many of our boys in there you can't even see what's going on at the bottom, but believe me, we've all heard stories," said Karen Reed, mother of Baltimore Ravens safety Ed Reed. "I just hate the fact that I know my son is down there all the time where I can't look out for him. I worry about other players taking advantage of him down there, maybe pressuring him to drink or smoke where they think they can get away with it." Several of the mothers also reported that after their sons exited the piles they often appeared woozy, delirious, or glazed--in some cases even vomiting at night--evidence the women cited as definitive proof that their offspring were drunk.
