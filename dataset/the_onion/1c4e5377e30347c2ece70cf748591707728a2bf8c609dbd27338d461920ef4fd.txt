PORTLAND, OR--Encouraging passing students to stop for a moment and chat about the great opportunities available at the company, Matt Damon reportedly manned the Warner Brothers booth Thursday at Portland State University's campus career day. "Warner Brothers is the perfect place to work if you're interested in acting, directing, producing, sound mixing, or all sorts of other career paths--really, there are so many great things you can do here," said Damon, who attempted to gain the attention of the career fair attendees by inviting them over to try to win a Warner Brothers T-shirt or Frisbee by spinning a prize wheel set up at the booth, at which point he would begin telling them about the film studio's competitive salaries and benefits package. "My day-to-day work is really exciting. Plus, it's a big company with lots of great perks for its employees, and you get to be really creative while working alongside lots of interesting people. Feel free to take a brochure and think it over." At press time, Damon was seen handing his business card out to several interested students and telling them they could contact him anytime if they had any questions about Warner Brothers.
