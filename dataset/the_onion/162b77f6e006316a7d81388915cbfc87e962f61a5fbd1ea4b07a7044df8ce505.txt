The Boy Scouts of America released 14,500 pages of so-called "perversion files," which include details of child molestation at the hands of scoutmasters between 1959 and 1985, and reveal that more than a third of such instances were not reported to police. What do think? "They should have named the file something else, like 'Boring Work Stuff.'" Troy Hartung * Systems Analyst "Fortunately, I was lucky enough to grow up with a scoutmaster who was very open about his molestation habits." Dane Czulewicz * Touch-Up Painter "At least those Boy Scouts were protected from the presence of gay people." Margaret Waxman * Weigh Station Inspector
