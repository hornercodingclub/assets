LOS ANGELES--At a press conference Monday, Everton and Los Angeles Galaxy forward Landon Donovan announced his signing of a $2-Per-Goal contract with his grandparents Frank and Dianne Donovan--a full 100 percent raise from his previous agreement. "Obviously, I'm thrilled to have this deal, and the 50-cents-per-assist clause was completely unexpected," said Donovan, counting on his fingers how much money he'd made in the past week. "Plus, Grandpa Frank gives me a silver dollar from his milk jug every time I visit, so if I save up, I might be able to buy a bicycle by this summer." As for last year's controversy surrounding the ice cream sundae Donovan was promised if he had fun and showed good sportsmanship, the star forward said that was all put aside after his grandma offered a signing bonus of his favorite meat loaf dinner.
