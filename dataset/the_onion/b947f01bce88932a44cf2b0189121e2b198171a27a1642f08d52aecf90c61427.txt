COLUMBUS, OH--Entering the final month before the general election, sources within the campaign announced today their new strategy of focusing on voters in neighborhoods where Romney staffers are too scared to go. "We've already pinpointed several low-income, primarily black and Hispanic neighborhoods that the Romney team has avoided at all costs," said local Obama 2012 volunteer Jacob Fitzsimmons, describing efforts to get the president's message out in high-crime, inner-city areas that most of Romney's canvassers won't even drive through. "Romney staffers that do travel to these areas are typically ineffective because they roll up their windows, lock their car doors, and get nervous when stopping at intersections. Additionally, we believe we can make tremendous strides in neighborhoods where Romney campaign volunteers are willing to go, but never past 6 p.m." Members of the Romney camp countered this afternoon by saying they planned to redouble their efforts in gated suburban communities that would never allow Obama supporters to enter, let alone knock on doors.
