MOSCOW--Working frantically to readjust the schedule they had outlined back in June 2015, Russian officials admitted to reporters Thursday that they have been left scrambling after seeing their plan to delegitimize Western democracy move much faster than they had intended. "We originally had a two-to-four-year timeline to carefully undermine the legitimacy of the American political system, so we've had no choice but to suddenly push ahead on a few things we didn't expect to even start talking about until at least 2018," said Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, adding that following the recent forced resignation of Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Russian officials had prepared for perjury allegations against Attorney General Jeff Sessions to arise sometime in mid-May at the earliest. "We were right where we wanted to be around November after slowly destroying the credibility of the Democratic party over the course of the prior year, but we never thought so much public trust in the White House would erode in a matter of a few weeks. We're pleased, of course, but keeping up is going to be a real challenge." Lavrov went on to say he was deeply concerned that Trump's impeachment would occur well before the president could cause the amount of damage to America that the Kremlin had originally intended.
