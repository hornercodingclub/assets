DETROIT--Following several years of lackluster performance and unmet expectations under his own roof, Detroit Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars announced this week that he will be stepping down in order to spend more time rebuilding his family from the ground up. "While I have a lot of good memories with these people, I think the time has come for me to leave basketball so that I can focus on taking my family to the next level," Dumars told reporters at a press conference, noting that the time had come to "shake up" his household, beginning with retooling his children's roles and making an upgrade in the wife position. "Obviously, there are a lot of very talented units out there who are increasingly shedding their older members in favor of younger talent, which means that we need to get some new blood in here if we want to stay competitive. But once that happens, there's no telling what these guys can do." Though Dumars said that he holds fond memories of his time in the Motor City, the 50-year-old was not ruling out giving his newly revamped kin a fresh start in Seattle, a city he claimed was about due for a winning family.
