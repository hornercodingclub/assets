INDIANAPOLIS--After suffering a gruesome compound fracture during last weekend's NCAA Midwest Regional final, Louisville guard Kevin Ware has been constantly rewatching a minute-long clip of his leg breaking on YouTube, sources confirmed Tuesday. "Whoa," said Ware, who reportedly muttered to himself as he played the footage of his right tibia violently snapping in half for the 24th consecutive time. "It's completely disgusting, but I can't stop watching it. Christ, if you go back to the 25-second mark you can definitely see the bone come through the skin and blood spill all over the court." At press time, a completely silent Ware was watching a continuously looping three-second GIF of his shin bending at a 90-degree angle in slow motion.
