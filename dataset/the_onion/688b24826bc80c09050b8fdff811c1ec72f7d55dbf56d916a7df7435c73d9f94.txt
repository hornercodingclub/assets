CHICAGO--Claiming they don't want to rush the veteran play caller, Bears coach Marc Trestman announced Thursday that the team is giving quarterback Jay Cutler three to four years to properly heal from a lingering ankle injury. "For the sake of the Chicago Bears, we feel it's best for Jay to take as many years as he needs to fully recover," said Trestman, who reportedly advised Cutler not to worry about returning in time for the playoffs or the 2014 NFL season. "Looking at the big picture and long-term goals of this football franchise, it would be reckless and irresponsible to allow Jay to get back on the field too soon. Unfortunately, high ankle sprains can be tricky and sometimes need one or two hundred weeks to fully mend." Bears general manager Phil Emery emphasized that Cutler should focus solely on rehabbing the ankle and that signing a contract extension with the team should be the last thing on anyone's mind.
