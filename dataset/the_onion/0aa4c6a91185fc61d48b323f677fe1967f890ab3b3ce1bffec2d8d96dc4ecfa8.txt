OSN shares its expert analysis on the teams that will come away with victory in this weekend's NFL week four games: -- The 49ers will rebound after a pair of tough losses in a 35-11 win over the Rams, leading San Francisco head coach Jim Harbaugh to only scream at his wife three times on the car ride home. -- Quarterback Joe Flacco could look pretty good this week against a depleted Bills secondary relying on head athletic trainer Bill Carpenter at cornerback. -- The Browns will have no answer for Cincinnati's elite long snapper Clark Harris. -- Chicago will prove once and for all that this team has a very easy schedule. -- Russell Wilson and the Seahawks face their greatest test yet against a hostile Texans crowd that don't take kindly to their type around here. -- While we think they should win easily, Andrew Luck and the Colts offense will have a tough time adjusting to the deafening silence of EverBank Field. -- Eli Manning will have another long day of trying to avoid being crushed by the Giants' toppling offensive line. -- If you have any interest in this game, you probably play for the Steelers or Vikings. -- The old witch said Arizona, and she hasn't been wrong yet. -- With Geno Smith leading the way, the Jets will continue their improbable march toward third place in the AFC East. -- Chip Kelly's high-octane Eagles offense will score six touchdowns in this 50-point blowout loss against the Broncos. -- Raiders pick up where they left off last week as they start the game down 16 points. -- The Chargers have the odds stacked against them, as they have been very poor against NFL offenses this season. -- Only a few weeks into the season, we've already seen enough: Tom Brady is the real deal. -- This prediction is actually a little hazy because the game is so far in the future.
