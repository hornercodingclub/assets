A 10-mile stretch of L.A.'s Interstate 405, the busiest highway in the United States, is closing for the weekend, causing many to cancel plans. What do think? "Oh, no! You can still jump off the overpass, though, right?" Kim Campbell * Systems Analyst "So much for L.A. being superior to everywhere else. I believe I'll go drive I-94 this weekend--not because I have anyplace to go, but simply because I can." Michael Dunbar * Battery Inspector "Can't L.A. residents just spend 48 hours waiting patiently in their cars for traffic to start moving again, the way they normally do?" David Lander * Administrative Director
