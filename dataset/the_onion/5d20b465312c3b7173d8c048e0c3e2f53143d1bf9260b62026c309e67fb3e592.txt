WASHINGTON--Circling every level multiple times with no luck whatsoever, reporter Philip Rucker was frustrated Tuesday that every space in the parking garage was taken up by an anonymous source. "I've gone around and around, but I can't find a single spot that isn't already filled by an unidentified White House leaker," said an exasperated Rucker, who recalled how easy it was to nab a prime parking place to clandestinely receive privileged information only a few short years ago. "It's such a nightmare driving all the way to the very top of the whole fucking structure to hold a secret meeting with an informant and then have to squeeze into a spot reserved for compact cars that another journalist who's meeting with a whistle-blower is halfway parked in anyway. Seriously, I have to start scheduling these rendezvous earlier, because as soon as dusk settles in, you can forget it." At press time, Rucker was idling his car near the space occupied by a reporter who had just received a thumb drive and appeared to be wrapping things up.
