Cody Wilson, founder of the libertarian nonprofit Defense Distributed, has created a functional plastic gun on a 3D printer that uses standard handgun rounds, demonstrating that anyone with such technology can make their own largely undetectable and untraceable firearm.

Christophe Bettenfeld * Knife Grinder "Sounds cool, but I'd probably rather just buy a real gun than trying to figure out how to set up another printer." Eva Zarrouk * Fumigator "Fuckin' Cody." Nicholas Kovacs * Laboratory Chief
