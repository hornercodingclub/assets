WASHINGTON--According to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center, the typical American possesses only 20 percent of what it takes. "Our research indicates that most of us have less than a quarter of what's required to make it happen," lead author Phillip McCray told reporters, adding that, on average, each American also had less than 10 percent of the goods. "The findings are surprising and alarming, as recent studies had suggested that U.S. citizens could step up and get it done upwards of 50 percent of the time." McCray went on to say that if the trend continued for another decade or so, there may be no one left in the U.S. who could bring it at all.
