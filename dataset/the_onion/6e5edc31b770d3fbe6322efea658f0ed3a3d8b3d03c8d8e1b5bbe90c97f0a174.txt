WASHINGTON--Easily securing the requisite two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate, a resolute United States Congress responded to the ongoing national debate on gun rights Tuesday by passing the Second Amendment again. "This is a very important issue, and I'm glad Democrats and Republicans were able to work together to take swift action," said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, joining members of both houses in celebrating the measure's nearly unanimous approval less than a week after a mass shooting in a Louisiana movie theater. "The amendment now goes out to the legislatures of each state, where we're confident it will be quickly ratified." McConnell added that, as further episodes of gun violence continue to shape the discussion surrounding firearms, Congress would not rule out passing the Second Amendment as many times as necessary.
