NEW YORK--An analysis of 16 professional football games conducted during the first week of the NFL season found that tackling, the act of forcing an opponent to the ground, remains the preferred method of stopping the forward movement of a ball carrier. "In the preseason, we tried a few new techniques like bargaining and hypnotism to take down the guy with the ball," said Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Greg Mattison, who added that he encourages players to use all forms of tackling, from diving into an opponent's legs to touching an opponent after he has already fallen to the ground. "But ultimately, tackling works the best." The Detroit Lions remain the only NFL team that opts not to use tackling, which experts agree probably has a negative effect on the team's standings.
