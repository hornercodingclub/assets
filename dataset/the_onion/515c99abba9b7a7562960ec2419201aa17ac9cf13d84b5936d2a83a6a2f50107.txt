MINNEAPOLIS--Commenting upon his seemingly effortless ability to interact with all kinds of women, friends of local financial analyst Matt Brownlow, a man who regularly treats members of the opposite sex with respect, reportedly asked the 28-year-old Monday what his secret is. "You just seem to have such a way with women--what's your trick?" friend Alex Stegman inquired of the considerate man who sustains healthy, meaningful relationships with women by consistently listening to them and not treating them as utilitarian instruments for male gratification. "I don't know how you do it. It seems like talking to women is so easy for you, and you're always able to get them smiling and engaged in conversation with you. Man, I wish I could do that." At press time, sources confirmed Brownlow could be overheard working his magic on a female coworker by thoughtfully asking about her weekend.
