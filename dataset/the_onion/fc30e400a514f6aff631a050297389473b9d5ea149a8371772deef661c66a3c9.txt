WASHINGTON--After allegedly clashing with the commander-in-chief behind closed doors over the past several months, Michelle Obama has been quietly reassigned to a position within the Department of Agriculture, White House sources confirmed Wednesday. "We appreciate everything Michelle has done in the West Wing, but she and the president haven't been seeing eye to eye on a number of key issues, so we agreed it was time for her to move on and put her skills to use elsewhere," said White House press secretary John Earnest, adding that while the two have had their differences of opinion, the president still has the utmost respect for her service and wishes her the best of luck going forward. "Michelle has been part of the Obama White House since the beginning, and we are grateful for that. However, the time was right for her to pursue a new direction. We know she has a lot to offer, and we're confident she will be a great fit in her new role at the Department of Agriculture." At press time, the president was reportedly planning to tap Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey to fill the role of first lady.
