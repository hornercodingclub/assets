DOYLESTOWN, PA--Describing him as frequently frustrated and overwhelmed, sources confirmed Monday that local Facebook user Michael Huffman is incredibly stupid. "I need stuff easy," said the absolute dipshit, adding that he finds many things confusing, and that those things must be changed so that they make sense to him. "I like looking at things on Facebook, but I don't understand a lot. Help, please." At press time, someone had reportedly fixed everything for the goddamn imbecile.
