TORONTO--Clarifying the storyline for fans of her book and its television adaptation, author Margaret Atwood announced Wednesday that the handmaids in her best-selling novel are supposed to be aliens.

"As far as we know, the extraterrestrials are genderless. They wear those long capes to hide their tentacles, and the color red doesn't symbolize anything, it's just the color of the oceans on their home planet Trovari-5.

Atwood added that she hoped people wouldn't make the same mistake about the television adaptation of her vampire thriller, .
