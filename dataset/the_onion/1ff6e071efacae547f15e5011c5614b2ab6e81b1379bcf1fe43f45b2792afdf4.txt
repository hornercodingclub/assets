WASHINGTON--In a stark reversal of past statements on the Trump Tower meeting, President Trump acknowledged Monday that he believed his eldest son would most likely be fine doing five to 10 years in a federal prison. "Despite reports that I'm concerned about my wonderful son being sent to jail, I actually think there wouldn't be much harm at all if he was imprisoned for a decade or so," said the president, directly contradicting previous reports that he had expressed worry to aides about his son facing legal repercussions for meeting with Russian agents by noting that Donald Jr. was a "resilient kid" who could easily weather a stint in a federal penitentiary until 2025. "Look, my son is young, he's got a good head on his shoulders--I bet he'd do absolutely fantastic behind bars. Frankly, I've just got no problem with him getting locked up in a cell until he's around 50. And, honestly, any news story telling you otherwise is a complete fabrication." Trump also dismissed claims that he had any qualms about never seeing Jared Kushner again if his senior advisor were to receive a life sentence for treason.
