BALTIMORE--Reflecting on a 12-4 season that showcased their gritty, brash, defense-first style, the Baltimore Ravens admitted Thursday that while everyone else chases the pretty, sexy wins, they actually prefer theirs ugly. "There's just something about the physical, dirty, sweaty ones, the ones that aren't much to look at but really make you work for it and might even hurt you," said one Ravens player who asked not to be named and claimed there were "at least 10 other guys" on the team who shared his feelings. "Everyone chases after the sexy ones, the ones with poise and so on, but there's something about grunting and shoving your way through that sweaty muck for an hour that makes an ugly one a lot more satisfying. Mmm. Yeah." The Ravens refused to name which of the ugly wins was their favorite, but admitted there was one "real hog wallow" in Tennessee they'd always regret letting get away from them.
