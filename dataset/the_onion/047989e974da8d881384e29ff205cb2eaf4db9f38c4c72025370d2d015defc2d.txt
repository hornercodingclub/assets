LOVELAND, CO--Asserting that he'd given a recent work project everything he had but that it wasn't quite enough, local office worker Tom Janssen is currently under the impression that he went down fighting, sources reported Monday. "Well, at the end of the day I came up a bit short, but I sure as heck gave it my all," said an incorrect Janssen, mistakenly identifying his wholly inadequate display of effort on a proposal, which was summarily rejected by his supervisor, as "pushing [himself] to the limit." "You win some, you lose some. I put it all on the line and I fought until the very end, but it just didn't work out this time, and I'm okay with that." Janssen then stated accurately that his level of commitment to the project "speaks for itself."
