FOREST LAKE, MN--Responding to an ongoing humanitarian crisis, U.N. aid workers reportedly descended on a local KFC Wednesday to deliver much-needed food to the restaurant's critically malnourished customers. "In all my years in the field, I've never come across a group of people who have gone so long without a proper meal," said U.N. humanitarian affairs director Gloria Dominguez, confirming that aid workers had distributed whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and other vital nutrients to patrons of the KFC location. "We're doing everything we can, but conditions on the ground here are desperate. In addition to their pervasive malnutrition, these people clearly don't have access to suitable sanitary facilities, and the stench is almost unbearable. It really breaks your heart." Dominguez noted that other U.N. aid operations in the area include a teen-pregnancy prevention program at a local Dairy Queen and a dysentery-outbreak clinic at a nearby White Castle.
