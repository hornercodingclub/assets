LONDON--Prince Harry and Meghan Markle reportedly set up their wedding registry with discount retailer Target Thursday, including a variety of kitchen, home decor, and bath items on the list of gift options for their guests. "This luggage is a little pricey, but it would be nice to finally have a set of matching suitcases," said Prince Harry of Wales while scanning the barcodes of picture frames, a flatware set, and a $30 Sunbeam Steam Master iron featuring a retractable cord. "They've got some pretty good coffee makers, too, you can just set the time and it'll start brewing in the morning. Oh nice, the 20-piece Corelle dinnerware set comes with two different sizes of bowls." At press time, the royal couple was hoping a family member would splurge and buy the nice pillows.
