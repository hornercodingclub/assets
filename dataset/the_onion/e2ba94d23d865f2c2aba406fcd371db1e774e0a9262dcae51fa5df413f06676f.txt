NEW ALBANY, IN--Defending his comment that a woman becoming pregnant from rape "is something intended," Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock dug himself into an even deeper hole today when he argued that, if you really stop to think about it, the Virgin Mary was basically raped by God. "Mary certainly didn't ask for God to impregnate her with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, but obviously the Immaculate Conception, while not the result of a consensual act, was still a part of God's plan--you see what I'm getting at, right?" said the 61-year-old man who currently serves as the state treasurer of Indiana. "Of course I don't condone sexual assault. I'm just saying that sometimes when a woman is violated and impregnated against her will, it's actually a really good thing in the end, because God's rape of Mary gave us Jesus, and Jesus saved mankind from sin. So that's one example right there." At press time, multiple male Senate candidates in their 60s remained divided between those who believe pregnancies resulting from rape are biologically impossible and those who believe they are the divine will of God.
