FORT COLLINS, CO--Describing the discovery as the most flawless specimen ever unearthed, a team of geologists working in northern Colorado announced Friday they had excavated a fully intact rock. "This stunning find provides an illuminating glimpse into what rocks may have looked like in their complete form millions of years ago," said lead geologist James Powell, adding that the extremely well-preserved rock offers unprecedented insight into the physical structure, shape, and characteristics of early rocks in ways that incomplete stone fragments and shards never could. "Previously, reconstructing a whole rock from small remnant pieces was difficult, and we never had a complete specimen. We'd invariably end up with several missing parts, and we could only speculate about what might have filled them. But now, we can safely say that these empty spaces were most likely filled with other bits of rock. It looks nothing like we could possibly imagine." Powell added that further research was necessary to determine if a geological link existed between rocks, pebbles, and boulders.
