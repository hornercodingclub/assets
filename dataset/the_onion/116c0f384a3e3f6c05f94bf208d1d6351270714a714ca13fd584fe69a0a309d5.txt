WASHINGTON--Concluding they had finally located the smoking gun, 379,000 Reddit users are reported to have simultaneously developed the belief that they had found the missing link in the investigation into alleged ties between Russia and President Trump's 2016 campaign. "This is it--this is going to blow everything wide open!" the thousands of amateur investigators said to themselves, each pointing to a completely different piece of information in a publicly available document that they were convinced was the single piece of proof that would, once and for all, expose the truth. "I just found the key to the whole thing right here. As soon as everyone sees this, the dominoes will start to topple and it will only be a matter of time. Oh, how the mighty will fall!" Sources confirmed that after publishing their findings as one of thousands of comments on one of thousands of posts on one of thousands of subreddits, each of the 379,000 users was sitting back and waiting for accolades.
