During a concert in Washington, D.C. Monday, pop singer Madonna urged the crowd to support President Barack Obama, whom she referred to as a "black Muslim in the White House" amid an impassioned, profanity-laced political speech. What do think? "Doesn't she realize how much media attention comments like this draw to her?" Ian Bialek * Systems Analyst "Did she happen to mention who she likes for Indiana attorney general? I'm still on the fence." Ernie Ingram * Reservoir Caretaker "Well, I just hope everyone still enjoyed themselves at her concert and felt like they got their money's worth."
