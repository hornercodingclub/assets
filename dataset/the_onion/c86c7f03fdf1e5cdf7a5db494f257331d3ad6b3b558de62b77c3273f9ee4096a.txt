DALLAS--With his campaign still reeling from a series of miscues, Republican presidential nominee asked a group of top advisers Wednesday whether it would be worth going after Obama by questioning the nation of his birth. "What about that whole deal with his birth certificate, or him being born in Kenya or wherever--you think that might stick?" said Romney, adding he was "just spitballing here." "Also, wasn't he connected to that terrorist guy, what's-his-name? Ayers? Bill Ayers? That might have legs, right? Let's look into that." After agreeing that the situations should be investigated, Romney and his aides then reportedly sat in silence for 10 whole minutes.
