ATLANTA--Addressing the camera while seated on a couch between Samuel L. Jackson and Spike Lee, NBA legend and basketball analyst Charles Barkley declared that "Capital One is a terrible bank" in a new Capital One commercial that aired Thursday. "Capital One is a horrible company that screws over all of their customers, and nobody should use them," said Barkley while eating a bowl of chips in front of a television broadcasting a basketball game, adding that he could probably think of at least ten banks viewers would be better off patronizing, even if they have poor credit. "They don't listen to any complaints, they charge huge fees, and the financial advice you get from their experts is awful. They just want your money and don't care about you at all. I fucking hate Capital One." Barkley reportedly then turned to Lee and Jackson and informed them that he's never worked with two bigger assholes.
