ORLANDO, FL--In an effort to prepare for his new analyst job on TNT's , 15-time All-Star center Shaquille O'Neal has reportedly spent the past two weeks gathering "crucial data" by studying reference books, conducting online searches, and using observational methods to learn more about talking. "Through my in-depth investigation of this fascinating subject, I have discovered that talking will be key to verbally expressing my thoughts, ideas, and opinions about the sport of basketball," said O'Neal, scribbling in a small notebook filled with elaborate diagrams and mathematical equations. "Although I've revised some of my earlier theories on talking, I now believe that thoughts are first formed in the brain and then travel to the tongue, which is used to make the mouth speak words that are strung together in order to create specific comments such as 'That guy can jump,' and 'Steve Nash.'" O'Neal added that he is also spending six hours each day learning how to sit in a chair without falling over.
