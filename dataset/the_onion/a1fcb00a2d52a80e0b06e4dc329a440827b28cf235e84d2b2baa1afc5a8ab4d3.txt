BOULDER, CO--Noting that his out-of-pocket costs seemed a little high, recently hired marketing assistant Jerry Aarons, 32, told sources Tuesday that he is beginning to suspect he's getting screwed over by his health plan's $180,000 deductible. "At my last job my annual deductible was only around $900 for the same coverage, so this seems a little off the mark," said Aarons, recalling how the plan had looked like a good deal on paper because once he pays the $180,000, he'd only be responsible for 60 percent of the subsequent costs plus no co-pay for preventative care. "After signing up, I did some rough estimates and I was like, 'Oh man, I have to go to the doctor 400 times and have 26 elective surgeries before this becomes worth it.' You know, I bet this plan is probably meant for an older person whose health isn't as great." At press time, Aarons was also starting to question the value of having a 401(k) that can't be touched until he's 130.
