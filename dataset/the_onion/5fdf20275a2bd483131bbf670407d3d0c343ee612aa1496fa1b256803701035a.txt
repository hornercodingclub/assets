INDIANAPOLIS--Capping off weeks of protest from local parents and students alike, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was forced to lower its speed limit to 20 mph Tuesday after an elementary school opened next to the straightaway. "If any IndyCar motorists are found speeding near Lincoln Elementary between the hours of 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., or otherwise while children are present, they will be fined and prosecuted to the highest extent of the law," said Indy 500 spokesperson Tarah Kissel, adding the school, which was built on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's spectator mound, caters to hundreds of 6- to 10-year-olds who must cross the racetrack Monday through Friday to get to class, regardless of the race schedule. "We understand that parents are concerned, especially given the history of reckless 200-mph driving that occurs near the school crosswalks. That is why, if any driver is caught disobeying a crossing guard or passing a school bus in the drop-off lane, fines will be doubled." At press time, IndyCar drivers were reportedly up in arms after a rogue basketball rolled onto the speedway during the school's recess and caused a fiery 12-car crash.
