CHARLESTON, SC--Doubled over a garbage can backstage at a local auditorium, a trembling, heavily perspiring Donald Trump reportedly shook his head back and forth and muttered in between bouts of nervous vomiting Friday that there was no way he could go out on stage for a campaign rally. "Don't make me go up there and talk in front of all those people, please--I can't do it, I just can't," said the Republican presidential frontrunner, beads of cold sweat matting his hair to his wan brow, and loudly dry heaving as aides handed him a glass of water and attempted to calm his nerves by pointing out that he had done this plenty of times before and assuring him that people really enjoyed his speeches. "I can't handle it--not again. There's too many people, and they're all looking at me. It's too much pressure. What if I mess up? Oh, God, I can hear them chanting now. No, no, no." At press time, aides had grabbed Trump by the shirtsleeves and were dragging the struggling, whimpering candidate toward the stage as "We're Not Gonna Take It" played over the loudspeakers.
