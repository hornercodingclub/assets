RIVERSIDE, CA--In an audacious and daring proclamation before Game 5 of the first-round playoff series between the Spurs and Clippers, local 31-year-old Doug Corrigan boldly declared Tuesday that it is a must-win game for Los Angeles, sources confirmed. "The whole season comes down to this--it's basically win or go home," said Corrigan, who was reportedly fearless--some would say heroic--while delivering his grand assertion that without a victory, the Clippers' championship aspirations are all but over. "If they end up having to go back to San Antonio for Game 6, they lose all their momentum, and then that's it--series over. It's all or nothing tonight." At press time, Corrigan truly went out on a limb upon declaring that Clippers star players Blake Griffin and Chris Paul will have to leave everything out there in order for their team to win.
