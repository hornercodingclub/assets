BOSTON--Calling the death a "tragic loss" and saying he was "truly devastated by the news," self-described Apple product loyalist Eric Cavanaugh is treating the passing of the company's former CEO Steve Jobs as if his fucking dad just died, sources confirmed Thursday. "I can't believe it," said Cavanaugh, 28, wearing a saddened expression that would make you think he was mourning the loss of his 61-year-old father, Jack, and not a complete goddamn stranger. "He meant a lot to me, and I'll miss him. I think I might send an e-mail to rememberingsteve@apple.com [instead of contacting the man he hasn't talked to in a month who helped him with his homework, paid his college tuition, and has supported him throughout his entire life, loving him unconditionally despite his myriad fuckups]." At press time, Cavanaugh reportedly needs to get his fucking priorities straight.
