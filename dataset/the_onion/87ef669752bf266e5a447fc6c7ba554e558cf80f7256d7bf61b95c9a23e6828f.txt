MANTOLOKING, NJ--Saying he had been deeply shaken by the extent of 's destruction, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney visited the storm-battered mid-Atlantic coast Thursday to help victims repair and re-erect thousands of downed Romney-Ryan campaign signs. "I've toured up and down the coastline, and I can tell you that the level of damage to campaign signage is unimaginable," said the visibly concerned candidate, wading through calf-high water and debris to place a tattered "Romney: Believe In America" sign back in the window of a flooded house. "The high winds and storm surge absolutely devastated the signs in their path, and sadly, a number were even washed out to sea. But my team and I will do everything we can to make sure these lawn signs receive the care they need and get back on their legs as soon as possible." Staffers confirmed the GOP candidate had also donated 10,000 Romney-Ryan baseball caps to families left homeless by the storm.
