LONDON--Quickly contorting his hands to type into a faint keyboard embedded in his wrist, a cackling Julian Assange reportedly disintegrated into lines of computer code Thursday as baffled authorities attempted to handcuff him. "You fools, I have become more powerful than you can possibly know--the truth cannot be contained," said Assange, the handcuffs falling through the evaporating lines of ones and zeros and clattering on the ground as the code split and flowed into nearby electronic devices, stunning British law enforcement who watched the WikiLeaks co-founder's face suddenly appear on every screen to taunt them. "I am one with the digisphere, the world's governments can never control me now. I have left your simple world behind and become something greater. No prison will ever hold me. Information will remain free forever!" At press time, the Trump administration demanded that cyberspace officials immediately extradite Julian Assange.
