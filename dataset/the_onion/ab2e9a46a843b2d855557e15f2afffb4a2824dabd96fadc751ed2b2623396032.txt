DETROIT--After their team dropped its second-straight game Sunday, Detroit Lions fans told reporters they were thrilled to get back to booing the hapless franchise. "Coming to the games and being disappointed at everything on the field for three consecutive hours--this is what it means to be a Lions fan," said Detroit resident Jim Kesseler, who has followed the team and booed it all his life. "I don't know how to cheer, and I'm glad I never wasted my time learning." The fans also expressed relief that newcomers to the Lions bandwagon were already leaving after two losses, as longtime supporters of the team were uncomfortable interacting with people who had not seen the franchise they love humiliated year after year.
