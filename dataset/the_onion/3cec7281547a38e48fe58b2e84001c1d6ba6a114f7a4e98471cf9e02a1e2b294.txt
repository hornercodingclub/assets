Merriam-Webster announced updates to its dictionary this week, including adding the use of the word "they" as a singular, nonbinary pronoun and weakening that case that using it is nongrammatical. What do think? "Everyone knows the English language is fixed at exactly 783,479 words and not one more." Andrew Ferrell * Grain Supplier "If Merriam-Webster says it's okay, then I guess my kid can move back in with me." Grant Winter * Bail Bondsman "Wow, I guess even language can be controversial now."
