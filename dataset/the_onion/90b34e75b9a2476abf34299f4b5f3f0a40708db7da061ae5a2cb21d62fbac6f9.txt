WASHINGTON--According to a study published Wednesday by geologists at Georgetown University, the earth's solid inner core will be the most livable part of the planet by the year 2060. "Provided that current trends continue as anticipated, within half a century the most favorable conditions for supporting human life will be located roughly 3,200 miles below the earth's surface, atop its superheated central sphere of iron and nickel," said study co-author Lance Zelowski, who predicted that by mid-century, the inner core's year-round temperature of 9,700 degrees Fahrenheit and its pressure of 3.5 million atmospheres would make it the most attractive location on the planet in which to live, work, and raise a family. "In order to ensure future generations grow up and reside in the best environment available, people will need to make preparations in the coming years to move their families to this highly compressed metallic ball surrounded by swirling liquid metal." Zelowski acknowledged that, due to its limited surface area, only the wealthiest would likely be able to purchase property on the inner core, leaving most of the world's population to make do in magma chambers directly beneath earth's crust.
