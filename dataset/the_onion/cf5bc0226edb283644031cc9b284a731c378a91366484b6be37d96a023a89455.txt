The new James Bond will be titled and released in April 2020, according to a social media announcement about the film, which will see Daniel Craig's character recruited from a vacation in Jamaica to thwart a global plot. What do think? "Great, another big budget sequel instead of a grounded, original dramedy about James Bond." Phyllis Ali * Urinal Cake Replacer "Now I can rest easy knowing a movie coming out in a year found its title." Stephen Dotson * Janitorial Supervisor "I hope this one ties up the loose plot threads from 'Spectre,' 'Moonraker,' 'Thunderball,' 'The Spy Who Loved Me,' and 'Goldeneye.'"
