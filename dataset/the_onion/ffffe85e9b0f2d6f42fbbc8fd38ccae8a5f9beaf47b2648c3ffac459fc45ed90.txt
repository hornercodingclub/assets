WASHINGTON--According to a report released Friday by the National Association of Sports Commissions, somebody needs to step up and take control of this game. "It's now or never," the report read in part, adding if somebody doesn't dig deep and find that extra gear, this thing is all but over. "Everybody's standing around waiting for somebody else to step up and make big plays. There's just no sense of urgency out there." The report concluded that it all comes down to who wants it more.
