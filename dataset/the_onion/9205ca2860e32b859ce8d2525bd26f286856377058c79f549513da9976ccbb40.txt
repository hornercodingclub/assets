DAMASCUS--Citing the ongoing international debate over his alleged use of chemical weapons, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad reportedly subjected himself to a small dosage of sarin gas Sunday "just to see what it feels like." "I figured it wouldn't hurt to try a tiny little bit--but holy shit, was I wrong," said Assad, who gingerly inhaled from a tube containing the lethal nerve agent and then proceeded to vomit into a nearby sink; experience severe eye pain, confusion, and partial paralysis; and then briefly lose consciousness. "I must've sniffed that stuff for, like, three seconds tops, but any more and I probably would have lost control of my entire central nervous system. I mean, can you imagine what a high dose of sarin would do to someone? Especially a child? Jesus." Assad then abruptly told reporters he needed to end the interview before collapsing to the ground and convulsing uncontrollably.
