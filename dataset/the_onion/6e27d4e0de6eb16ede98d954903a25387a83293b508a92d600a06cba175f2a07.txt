BUFFALO, NY--After signing a two-year contract with the team, quarterback Kevin Kolb revealed Wednesday that he has always dreamt of playing for the Buffalo Bills from the moment he was cut by the Arizona Cardinals and had absolutely no other alternatives. "Ever since I can remember being a free agent without a shred of interest from any other teams, I've always wanted to wear that Bills uniform," said Kolb, adding that he leapt at the opportunity as soon as he heard the Bills were the sole NFL franchise willing to employ him following his disappointing stint with the Cardinals. "To finally be where I've dreamed of playing since back when I was told by my agent that the Bills were my only shot at continuing my NFL career--it is really a dream come true." Reached for comment, Bills head coach Doug Marrone told reporters he had always hoped to work with Kolb, dating back to the first time he realized the six-year veteran was the only quarterback the team could get.
