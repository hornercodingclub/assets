ELMHURST, IL--Barely able to contain his enthusiasm for whatever they would be talking about later on, area man Marc Kahan was reportedly excited to hear that his girlfriend has been doing a lot of thinking, saying Thursday that she must have come up with a really great idea. "Oh boy, I can't wait to find out what it is!" said Kahan, 32, adding that he was expecting something "mind-blowing" due to the fact that his girlfriend had been thinking for "quite a while" and had apparently even lost some sleep over it. "I was so eager to hear it, I asked if she couldn't just tell me over the phone or even text me a hint, but she said it'd be better if we talked about it in person. Maybe there's some kind of cool visual part?" At press time, a devastated Kahan had heard what his girlfriend had been thinking and told reporters he never, ever would have come up with that in a million years.
