NEW YORK--Saying that many players assume they are somehow immune to the problems afflicting those who quit football, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced a broad new campaign Wednesday to warn all players about the long-term risks of retirement. "With this initiative, we're hoping to educate players about the enormous toll they might pay by leaving the game," said Goodell, adding that the league will highlight the full and potentially debilitating consequences of retirement, which include the frequent and often permanent loss of endorsements that have recently affected a number of high-profile former players. "Sadly, most NFL players will find that, without football, they'll have completely fallen apart financially by the time they're in their 40s, and sometimes even earlier than that. We've also seen that over time, their public profile begins to wear down, and it's truly heartbreaking to see them become totally unrecognizable to the fans who once loved and knew them so well." Goodell added that he aims to extend the awareness campaign to the youth level, as studies have found notions of quitting football have occurred in players as young as 8.
