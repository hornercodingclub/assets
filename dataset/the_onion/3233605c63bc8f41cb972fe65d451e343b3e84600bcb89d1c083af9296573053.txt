SAN ANTONIO, TX--As 21-year-old small forward Kawhi Leonard was prepped and placed under general anesthesia Friday, Spurs center Tim Duncan scrubbed up and entered the operating room in University Hospital to perform his teammate's arthroscopic meniscectomy. "With this type of injury, it's best to clear out this scar tissue around the tibia before repairing the tear here on the lateral meniscus," the 13-time NBA All-Star said while pointing to an MRI scan of Leonard's left knee. "Basketball is Kawhi's life, so it's nice to be able to help him get back on the court. Nurse, I'm going to need a C-mount arthroscope and a biting clamp, please." After carefully suturing the last incision, Duncan washed up and began outlining a regimented physical therapy program that would have Leonard playing again by November.
