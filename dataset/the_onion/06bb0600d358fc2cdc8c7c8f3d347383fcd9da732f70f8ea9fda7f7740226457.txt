VICKSBURG, MS--Acknowledging that she hadn't finished what she was saying in quite some time, family sources confirmed Monday that local mom Debra Garrison has not spoken a full, uninterrupted sentence to her family since 1997. According to witnesses, despite regularly contributing to conversations throughout the past 20-plus years, Garrison has failed to complete a single coherent thought before being talked over by one of her children or contradicted mid-sentence by her husband. Reports further indicate that the closest the 47-year-old mother of three has gotten to finishing a sentence in the past two decades was in 2003 when she said, "Hey, why don't we get dinner at--," just before her oldest daughter abruptly got up and walked out of the room. Recent accounts suggesting Garrison had at long last completed a sentence in the presence of her son were undermined by the discovery that he was wearing headphones and had not heard a single word.
