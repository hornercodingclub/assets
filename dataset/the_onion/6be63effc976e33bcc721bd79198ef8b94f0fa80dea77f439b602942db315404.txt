Why wait for the human skeleton, the guy with way too many fingers, and that nutjob with literally a thousand facial piercings? We're not wasting your time with a woman that can speak 47 languages unless she's also 18 fucking inches tall." Glenday went on to say that the book also included several pictures of the Elephant Man even though he wasn't technically a world record holder because, holy shit, look at him.
