INDIANAPOLIS--In the wake of the Colt's 28-24 upset loss to the San Diego Chargers last Sunday, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning remains tight-lipped as to whether or not he plans on firing longtime head coach Tony Dungy. "I don't think it would be wise to make a decision on Tony's future with this loss so fresh in my mind," Manning told reporters during his post-game press conference. "I am going to take Monday off and listen to what [general manager] Bill [Polan] and [Colts owner] Jim [Irsay] have to say on Monday night. I should have my final decision before the end of next week." Though Manning remained mum on Dungy's future, he told reporters that he intends to fire both the Colts' offensive and defensive coordinators and will more than likely promote Colts assistant marketing director Henry Jacobs to executive director of digital business.
