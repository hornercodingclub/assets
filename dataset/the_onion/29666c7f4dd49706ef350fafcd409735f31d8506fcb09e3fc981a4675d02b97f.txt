WASHINGTON--In an effort to ensure a constructive discussion for tonight's town hall on gun control, White House Communications Director Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday that officials are carefully screening any audience questions that refer to President Obama as "Mein Fuhrer." "While we try to include as many different questions as we can regarding the various elements of the gun control debate, any inquiry that specifically addresses the president as 'Mein Fuhrer' will be immediately discarded," said Psaki, adding that the vetting process also involved promptly removing submissions that contain various iterations of "tyrant," "the Kenyan," and "Dictator Obama." "It's quite challenging to catch all of them since there are so many questions, and most are written in all capital letters, with multiple exclamation points instead of question marks. We received an excellent query about state versus federal background check protocols, but it began with a reference to Sharia law, so it was instantly rejected." Psaki told reporters, however, that in order to fill out the hour-long forum, the White House would have to let one question about false flag attacks slide.
