NEW YORK--In an effort to cater to a long-neglected demographic, global cosmetics brand L'Oreal released Sheer Discretion this week, a new line of makeup specially designed for men to wear when their wives are not home. "Sheer Discretion enables men everywhere to finally give themselves the full eyelashes and pouty lips they deserve while their wives are away at work," L'Oreal representatives said of the cosmetic products, which come in discreet packaging and can be quickly wiped clean with just a splash of water if one's wife suddenly walks through the front door. "Featuring a smooth foundation that conceals, hides imperfections, and blends evenly over the thickest stubble, our Sheer Discretion line of products are casual enough for just hanging out in the living room in your wife's blouse or providing that exact dash of chic you need to pull off her ruby chiffon gown." L'Oreal executives confirmed that the product release would be accompanied by an advertising campaign urging women to enjoy an evening out with their friends and leave their husbands at home for the night.
