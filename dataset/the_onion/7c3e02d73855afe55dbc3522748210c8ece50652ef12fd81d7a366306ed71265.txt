BENTONVILLE, AR--Telling reporters they were having difficulty keeping track of all the new pastimes he was pursuing, friends of local man Mark Chapineau stated Tuesday that the recent divorce was burning through hobbies at an unsustainable rate. "Last week, he was posting on Facebook about how he was getting into meditation, and now you can see he's already onto black-and-white photography--boy, he's really tearing through activities one after the other," said Chapineau's old college roommate Sahil Neela, adding that the 38-year-old insurance broker, whose five-year marriage ended in September, had, according to his latest status update, begun training for a marathon, despite mentioning a couple weeks prior that he had joined a rock-climbing gym. "It's crazy. He's throwing himself into cooking and collecting vinyl when he's only had his microbrewing kit 24 hours. Seriously, if he doesn't want to confront what just happened in his life, he's going to have to space these things out a whole lot better." Neela acknowledged, however, that he'd rather watch his friend exhaust every potential hobby than actually listen to him talk about his problems.
