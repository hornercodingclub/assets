Teen pop sensation Justin Bieber was seen struggling during a performance of "Beauty and a Beat" at a show in London last night before walking off stage and fainting out of view of the audience, and was later taken to a hospital. What do think? "It must be that we didn't love him enough. I'm sorry, Justin!" Michelle Basantani * Wireworker "As long as he keeps tweeting shirtless pictures from the hospital, he can collapse all he wants." Orson Whittemore * Systems Analyst "I don't see why he can't perform while sitting in an easy chair and sipping some tea." Marty Zorniak * Gas Leak Tester
