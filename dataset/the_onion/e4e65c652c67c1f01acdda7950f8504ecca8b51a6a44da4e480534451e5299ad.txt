MINNEAPOLIS--Star forward Kevin Garnett reiterated his desire to remain with the third-place 26-30 Timberwolves--the team with which he has lost for 11 seasons--claiming that he simply enjoys being defeated by far superior teams on a regular basis. "To me, there is no feeling quite like losing. I've always said that losing is the most important thing, and I feel like I can lose in Minnesota this year as well as for years to come," Garnett said. "Sure, I might have a better chance of losing in Memphis or Milwaukee, but it would just be more special to lose in front of the fans in Minnesota." Garnett added that a playoff appearance this year would not change his mind, as he has been waiting since 2004 to get another chance to lose on basketball's biggest stage.
