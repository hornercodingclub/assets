The Miami Marlins fired manager Ozzie Guillen on Tuesday following a disappointing 69-93 season in which his team failed to live up to the hype of its new ballpark and All-Star-laden roster. What do think? "I'm sure he's taking it with calmness and grace." "Seems a little harsh to fire your manager after just one 93-loss season in which he blows $191 million in salary and alienates a huge portion of your fan base." "Fortunately for Ozzie, there are a lot of GMs looking for narcissistic, homophobic, loudmouthed assholes to manage their baseball teams these days."
