Citing thousands of monthly complaints about robocalls, the Federal Trade Commission has offered a $50,000 award to anyone who devises a technology to block illegal automated telemarketing calls while leaving legitimate calls unaffected. What do think? "I don't think the FTC has thought this through. Do they even realize how many jobs this would cost the scamming industry?" Pam Troop * Paramedic "I don't want to brag, but our government must be doing pretty well if it's suddenly throwing around $50,000." Ky Wood * Quilt Stuffer "Make that $50,010. I'll throw in 10 more bucks." Clarence Kressel * Well Driller
