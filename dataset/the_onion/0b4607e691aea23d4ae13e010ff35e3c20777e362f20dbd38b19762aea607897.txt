HOUSTON--Shouts of "Go to hell!" and "Eat shit, loser!" were heard from the stands Sunday night as a man wearing a Texans jersey was subjected to fierce harassment and abuse by fans at Reliant Stadium, sources confirmed. "Take that off, asshole!" one fan reportedly screamed as a cascade of boos, insults, and obscenities from the entire section were directed at the man, who was also given the middle finger by several spectators in an adjacent row. "You think you can show up here wearing that shit? Go home before you get your fucking ass kicked!" At press time, after being hit with a cup of beer, security had escorted the man out of the stadium for his own safety. : Sources just confirmed that the aforementioned section of fans has resumed watching the game and are now loudly shouting obscenities at the Texans.
