SAN ANTONIO--In an effort to inspire the team before Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, Spurs captain Tim Duncan reportedly reminded his teammates Friday to always put their duties as fathers before their jobs as basketball players. "What you do on this court is nothing compared to what you do at home for your children," said Duncan, adding that what this country lacks most is not basketball players but mature men. "The playoffs end in June, but the responsibilities of fatherhood? Those are year-round. Guys, it doesn't matter if you score 10,000 points or win three NBA championships--spending time with your kids: the championship. This is just a game, after all." Duncan then referred his teammates to a study showing that children with absent fathers were more likely to have behavioral problems than those whose fathers were present and involved in their lives.
