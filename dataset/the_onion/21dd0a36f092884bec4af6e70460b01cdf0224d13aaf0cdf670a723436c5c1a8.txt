SEATTLE--Following an interview this morning during which job applicant Joshua Meyer described his admiration for the way Incite Analytics integrates a creative mindset with a business-minded approach, sources within the local marketing firm said they were "completely blown away" by the prospective employee's extensive knowledge of the company's "About Us" webpage. "I have to say, Joshua seemed to have a really firm handle on our values and goals as a company," said human resources manager Rebecca Clifton, admitting that she was also "pretty floored" by Meyer's ability to name the exact year the firm was founded and where its original headquarters were located. "He referred to us as a pioneer in the digital marketing industry and was aware that we help our clients maximize opportunities in a changing media landscape. He even knew about our core partnerships with market leaders like Acquia and Target. All around, he's a pretty remarkable candidate who really seems to understand what we do here." Clifton added that Meyer further managed to "knock her socks off" by providing short biographies of each member of the company's executive leadership team.
