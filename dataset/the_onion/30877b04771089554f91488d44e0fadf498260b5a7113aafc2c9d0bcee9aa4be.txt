WASHINGTON--Calling it a glaring and unacceptable gap in the nation's diet, an alarming study released Thursday by the Center for Science in the Public Interest revealed that hundreds of everyday food items remained unavailable in s'mores flavor. "Our research found that numerous items--even staples such as milk and bread--are still rarely found in a s'mores variety," said CSPI senior nutrition policy counsel Jessica Almy, adding that it was all too easy to fill an entire shopping cart with products completely untouched by artificial graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow flavoring agents. "Until all food items are chemically manipulated to taste like s'mores themselves, or at least contain s'mores filling, we urge consumers to read food labels carefully before purchasing." Almy went on to praise Nabisco for its recent introduction of S'mores Oreos, and expressed hope that other brands such as Minute Maid orange juice, Wesson cooking oil, and Hebrew National hot dogs would soon follow suit.
