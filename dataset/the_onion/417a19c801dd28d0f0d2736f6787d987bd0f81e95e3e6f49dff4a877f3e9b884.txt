ORLANDO--Injury-prone Orlando Magic forward Grant Hill announced yesterday that he has scheduled season-ending surgery despite being in the "best shape of [his] career." "I'm doing fine, but now just feels like the right time to get major reconstruction done on my ankle," Hill said after a practice in which he led his team in several sets of wind sprints, and showed off his newly restored jumping ability with a 180-degree dunk. "My only hope is that the Orlando fans understand that this is ultimately for the best, and after rehab, I should be back next year ready to go." Hill has scheduled his surgery to take place the day before the Magic face the Detroit Pistons, a game Hill has been anticipating all season now that he is capable of playing full time and is leading his team in scoring.
