ORLANDO, FL--While attending a recent party following one of Major League Baseball's winter meetings Monday, Commissioner Bug Selig mentioned Hall of Fame outfielder Willie Mays repeatedly throughout the night, recounting numerous anecdotes of meeting, talking to, and being in the same restaurant as the former Giant. "A couple of us were debating why home runs were down this year, when out of nowhere Bud jumps in telling us what his 'buddy Willie' said it was like to hit 500 home runs," New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon said. "He clearly wanted us to ask 'Willie who?' the entire time, but none of us would give him the satisfaction. Eventually he showed us that he had Willie Mays' number in his phone. It was pathetic." Later Selig was seen regaling New York Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner with the story of the time he met Derek Jeter.
