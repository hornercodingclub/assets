WASHINGTON--Hoping to raise public awareness about a rare deep-space broadcasting phenomenon, the American Astronomical Society published a press release Friday informing citizens that Wednesday night will be their best chance to view on PBS. "Our projections show that stargazers on the east coast will be able to experience the awe-inspiring magnificence of this once-in-a-lifetime documentary series at exactly 9 p.m.," said AAS Executive Officer Kevin B. Marvel, who said the scientific spectacle can be plainly observed by the naked eye. "While we're expecting the celestial science program to peak at around 9:33 EST, should still be visible for roughly another half hour thereafter." Marvel added that Americans who live on the west coast will want to set an early alarm to take in the majestic production.
