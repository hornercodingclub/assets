PITTSFIELD, IL--Noting that it would be nice to finally have a little spending cash on hand, both Pittsfield High School junior Marissa Klemp and chemistry teacher Rebecca Murphy applied for the same seasonal waitress position at a local diner, sources confirmed Thursday. "Right now, I'm borrowing money from my family half the time, so even picking up a few dollars here and there would be great," said the 16-year-old Klemp, echoing the exact sentiments of her 10th-grade science teacher, both of whom hoped to use the money to buy some new clothes before the next school year started. "If the tips work out just right, maybe I could even get my own car and wouldn't have to borrow my parents' station wagon anymore. I really hope I get this." Murphy and Klemp both went on to express confidence they would land the position, citing their relevant work experience waitressing around town over the previous two summers.
