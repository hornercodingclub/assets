NEW YORK--For the first time in its nine-year history, Animal Planet's annual Puppy Bowl will feature a coaching matchup between puppies from the same litter, with two 14-week-old Bernese Mountain Dog brothers calling the plays for Puppy Bowl IX, sources confirmed Thursday. "Whether they want the attention or not, the battle of wits between Gunner and Zeus will be all anyone's talking about come game day," said Jezebel editor Doug Barry, noting that the puppies, who were raised together on a rural Ohio farm, displayed a knack for strategy and barking orders from an early age. "We already know these dogs are masters at moving the football chew toy down the field--the question will be how they respond to the combined pressure of sibling rivalry and performing on puppy football's biggest stage." The two coaches, along with the 62 puppies under their command, will reportedly be available for adoption at animal shelters throughout the country following the game.
