WASHINGTON--Growing increasingly panicked while struggling with the safety devices, the nation's still-undecided voters reportedly shouted for help Friday when they couldn't get their seatbelts off. "Help me--it's stuck," said Westerville, OH resident Daniel Roark, who has yet to determine which presidential candidate he will be voting for after a year and a half of campaigning, primaries, conventions, attack ads, and three nationally televised debates, adding that the lap and shoulder restraint "is really, really tight" and "hurts [his] stomach." "Ow, ow, ow. I can't get this part out of the other thing. I'm pulling on it a lot, but it's not working. It's squishing me." At press time, 30 percent of the undecided voters had cut off their oxygen supply after inadvertently tangling their seatbelt around their neck.
