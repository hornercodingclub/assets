MEDFORD, MA--Leading a group of nearly two dozen high school juniors and seniors to various points of interest around campus, Tufts University tour guide Michelle Davis reportedly took time while describing every location Thursday to remind tour members that, first off, they have to be admitted. "Next up is Tisch Library, which houses over 700,000 books and which has a rooftop patio where you can study, read, or just enjoy the great view of Boston, provided you get into the university, of course," Davis said, adding that the 21 percent of applicants who are accepted to Tufts each year have full access to the library's extensive digital collections and archives as well. "And this is the Residential Quad, commonly called Res Quad, where, if you make it through the admissions process, you can watch fireworks on Tuftonia's Day, which is held the day before Spring Fling. Last year, the New Pornographers played Spring Fling, and a couple years before that we had Lupe Fiasco. It's so much fun, if you happen to get in." At press time, Davis was asking the tour members if those among them who had a realistic shot of being accepted and could afford four years of the private institution's tuition had any questions.
