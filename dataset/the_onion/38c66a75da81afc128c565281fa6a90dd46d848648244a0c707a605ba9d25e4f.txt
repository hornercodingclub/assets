HEAVEN--Legendary sports broadcaster Harry Kalas narrated NFL Films co-founder Steve Sabol's ascension to heaven Tuesday, providing a stirring play-by-play of the 69-year-old soul's dramatic entry into the Kingdom of . "It's a blustery day for a journey to heaven but Steve Sabol comes out soaring, hits a shaft of light, and rockets upward," Kalas said. "It could be--it is! He's going all the way to the Pearly Gates. He's flying across the sky now and quickly eludes St. Peter with a stiff arm. And he's done it. Steve Sabol has risen to the occasion and ascended into heaven." Kalas, who described Sabol's performance as flawless, confirmed that 750,000 angels were on their feet and cheering.
