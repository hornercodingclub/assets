DALLAS--After seeing the inside of a small office room near the elliptical machines at Fitworks Gym, sources confirmed Monday that personal trainer Marc Robinson has a desk. "It's a desk with a little pen holder and drawers for, I don't know, his papers or something, I guess," said gym member Maggie Rosado of the desk, which belongs to a man whose job consists primarily of walking around the interior of a fitness center and helping people lift weights. "There is a chair, too, for when he needs to sit down at his desk for extended periods of time and do, you know, work. Paperwork. Or whatever it is he needs a desk for." At press time, sources were staring with quizzical expressions at a large file cabinet near the desk.
