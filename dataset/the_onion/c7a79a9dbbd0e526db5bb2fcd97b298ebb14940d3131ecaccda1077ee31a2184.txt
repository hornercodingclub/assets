MEDIA, PA--Folding laundry Thursday morning as she watched television coverage of the latest revelations in the affair between Gen. David Petraeus and his biographer Paula Broadwell, local mother Dinah Cooley told reporters she wished she had enough time to fuck the director of the CIA once in a while. "What I wouldn't give to just drop everything, slip away for a little while, and fuck a CIA director," Cooley said with a huff, adding that she doesn't understand why it's always someone else who gets to have fun fucking high-ranking military and intelligence officers. "Between cooking three meals a day, chauffeuring the kids around, and keeping this house in order, I barely have time to fuck a low-level CIA operative, much less the director of the whole agency. And even if I did get an hour alone with him, I'd probably be too exhausted to really get anything out of it." Sighing softly as she returned to her work, Cooley added that she would just have to settle with fucking her neighbor for now.
