NEW ORLEANS--In a star-studded gala hosted by James Brown, the Baltimore Ravens were honored for their distinctive achievement in the football industry Sunday, winning Best Team at the 2013 Super Bowl Awards. "It's really so incredible to take home the Lombardi for Best Team," said tearful Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, who also received the Best Original Score award for "34," and Best Adapted Screen Play based on a 1999 pass by Andy Reid. "I want to thank everyone involved in making this team, the other nominees, as well as the voters at the Academy of Football Arts and Sciences." Though the Ravens won 14 different awards, including Best Hair and Makeup for linebacker Ray Lewis, the 49ers Alex Smith was also honored with Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his disturbing and gut-wrenching portrayal of San Francisco backup quarterback Alex Smith.
