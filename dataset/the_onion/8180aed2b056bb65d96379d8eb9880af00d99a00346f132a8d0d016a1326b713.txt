LANSING, MI--Having watched with mounting excitement as the pallid, sniffling man made his way toward her register from the pharmacy section, local CVS cashier Hannah Everson told reporters Thursday she was overjoyed at the prospect of accepting a $20 bill from a customer purchasing three different kinds of cough medicine. "Oh, boy, I can't wait to get my hands on that damp twenty--if I'm lucky, he'll use his clenched fist to cover a small coughing fit before reaching for his wallet," said Everson, adding that she hoped the man slowly placing cough syrup, throat lozenges, and sinus medication on the counter would at least wipe his nose on the back of his hand before grabbing the bill and handing it over. "I was a little upset that he didn't sneeze right in front of me when he reached the head of the line, but thankfully, just as he was stepping up to my register, he pulled out a crumpled, used tissue from his pocket, held it to his face, and blew his nose for about 30 continuous seconds. That was an unexpected treat!" Everson added that she could barely contain her elation at the promise of receiving a handful of warm, sticky coins after the man assured her he had exact change.
