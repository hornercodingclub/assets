HOUSTON--Following up on his assertion that Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh is "not Houston Texan-worthy," Texans quarterback Matt Schaub released a comprehensive list to the media Tuesday cataloging who he believes deserves a place on the team's 53-man roster. "The following people are worthy of playing for the Houston Texans: Larry Fitzgerald, Peyton Manning, Brian Urlacher, Aldon Smith, Sebastian Janikowski," said Schaub, reading an excerpt from the 10,000-name list, which he told reporters was compiled according to "who these people are and what they stand for." "Additionally, Aaron Rodgers is a Texans-quality person, as are Deion Sanders, Walter Payton, Merlin Olsen, Rosa Parks, Dennis Rodman, Warren Buffett, my wonderful parents, Johnny Unitas, Suri Cruise, Manti Te'o, Genghis Khan, Calvin Johnson, and the architect Frank Lloyd Wright." Schaub confirmed that only one current Texan is included on the list: second-string fullback Tyler Clutts.
