DOYLESTOWN, PA--Facetiously questioning how the game had suddenly become a non-contact sport, local father Aaron Harper confirmed his belief Thursday that referees officiating a Thanksgiving game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Detroit Lions should just let them play football out there. "How are you going to penalize a guy for a clean play like that?" said the visibly irked 53-year-old, adding that the officials are ruining the game by making a big deal out of every little push and shove they see. "If you can't take a hit, then you shouldn't be on the field. This isn't soccer--these guys need to drop the whistle for two seconds and let them play the damn game." Harper was reportedly later overheard yelling that a player undergoing the league's mandatory concussion protocol needs to "just walk it off and get back out there."
