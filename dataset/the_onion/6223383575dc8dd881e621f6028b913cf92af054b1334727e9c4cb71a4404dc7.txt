LOS ANGELES--During his introductory press conference as USC's new head coach last Wednesday, Lane Kiffin told reporters that he would be leaving the school indefinitely to pursue his dream of working at GameStop. "I was approached by a cousin who works at the GameStop on Wilshire Boulevard, and when he said there was an open sales clerk position, I had to take it," said Kiffin, who then proudly placed a GameStop baseball cap on his head. "I have been going to that GameStop for years. I know the people there. I know the customers. This is just an opportunity I couldn't pass up." Before leaving the press conference, Kiffin told reporters that, while he is committed to GameStop, his heart will always belong to the Beverly Center Sunglass Hut.
