WASHINGTON--According to a poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, 80 percent of Americans would, if given even one opportunity, enter a stranger's vehicle for a shot at starting a new life. "Our research indicated that as long as the driver was headed somewhere else, anywhere else, more than three quarters of Americans would get in that person's car without any hesitation," said Pew spokesperson Sylvia Ettinger, adding that neither the make of the vehicle, its intended destination, nor the appearance or temperament of the driver would have any bearing on the decision. "Provided that entering the vehicle offered even the remotest possibility of a clean break from the past, eight out of every 10 people we surveyed said they were happy to toss their cell phone and wallet into a ditch and put their destiny in the hands of the very first person who pulled over." The poll found, however, that only 3 percent of Americans would pick up some weirdo standing on the side of the road with his thumb out.
