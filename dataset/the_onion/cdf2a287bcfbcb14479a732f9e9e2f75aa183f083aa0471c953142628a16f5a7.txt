ATLANTA--After missing four consecutive days this week, sources close to Marcus Vick confirmed that the former Virginia Tech quarterback is considered unlikely for his Sunday afternoon shift at Sbarro. "Marcus showed a lot of promise early on, but it's looking increasingly doubtful that he'll be on the floor this weekend," branch manager Glenn Bailey told reporters, adding that lingering issues had prevented the former athlete from fulfilling his role as the restaurant's go-to cashier. "Everyone on my staff would be thrilled if Marcus showed up at 100 percent this weekend, but with his history that's just wishful thinking. While Sunday is a huge day for us and we could really use him, I can't help but feel that his professional food services career is over." Restaurant insiders have speculated Vick's absence may provide a valuable opportunity for his current backup, former No. 1 draft pick and Sbarro trainee JaMarcus Russell.
