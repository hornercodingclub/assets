ORLANDO--NBA commissioner David Stern interrupted the halftime ceremony of the Sixers-Magic game Wednesday to announce that Shaquille O'Neal would be returning to the court this postseason, not as a player, but as a guest referee in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Championship. "It's time I brought the law enforcement back into the NBA," Stern said as he introduced the unsmiling O'Neal, who glowered at the crowd while wearing a black-and-white-striped referee shirt with the sleeves cut off. "He won't let any of you get away with the crap you're pulling with the current refs. Shaq Attack is back--and in full effect." In addition to O'Neal, Stern has appointed Vince Carter to serve as "The Enforcer," whose job is to check tickets and sell concessions at all games.
