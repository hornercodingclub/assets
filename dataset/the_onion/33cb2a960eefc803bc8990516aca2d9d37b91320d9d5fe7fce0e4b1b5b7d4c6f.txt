NEW YORK--A new 400-page report released Monday by the Pew Research Center confirmed that everyone--absolutely everyone--other than you is starting new, exciting phases of their lives and careers. "Our results indicate that those around you are all turning a new leaf, moving forward to face a fresh challenge, and embarking on periods of immense personal and professional growth, while you on the other hand are in a phase of total stagnation, if not regression," said head researcher Dr. James Messemer, adding that the data also suggests that everyone sees the clear contrast between those who are really blossoming by moving on to meet a new opportunity and you, an individual perceived as being stuck in a rut, left behind, or simply someone who has already reached their potential. "Our study proves that, unlike yourself, all of your peers are enriching themselves by experiencing the triumphs and failures associated with any new personal journey, a journey that will ultimately be looked back upon as the most fulfilling part of these individuals' lives. Meanwhile, you remain trapped in a state of perpetual--well, our researchers would have to call it ennui, as there is really no other word for it." The study determined that the odds of any of this changing were less than 7 percent.
