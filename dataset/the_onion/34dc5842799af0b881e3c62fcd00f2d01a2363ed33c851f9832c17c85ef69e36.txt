WASHINGTON--Football fans across the nation were reportedly exhilarated this week, claiming that they were thrilled for the much-anticipated opportunity to finally see a Harbaugh lose a Super Bowl. "I'm so pumped up! I can't wait to savor every moment of a Harbaugh losing an NFL Championship," said Kansas City resident Eric Rasmussen, adding that he's praying for Super Bowl XLVII to be an embarrassing blowout. "It's going to be awesome watching that special moment when a Harbaugh dejectedly walks off the field instead of hoisting up the Lombardi Trophy." While the country's football fans admitted seeing a Harbaugh lose the AFC Championship and NFC Championship last year was something "very special," most confirmed that "this will be way better."
