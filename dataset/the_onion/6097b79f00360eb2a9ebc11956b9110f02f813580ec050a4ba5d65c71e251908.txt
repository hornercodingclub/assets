TORONTO--Potential No. 1 NBA draft pick Adam Morrison managed to not be in his usual excellent form during a workout for the Toronto Raptors last week, sending several easy right-handed layups clanging off the backboard and acting as if he couldn't figure out how to even attempt the shot left-handed. "Well, some days you have it, and some days--particularly days when you're trying out for a team that went 27-55--you just don't," Morrison said. "Maybe my poor play here has to do with getting adjusted to the air in Toronto, or maybe it has to do with the thought of playing for so few fans, most of whom think of a full-court pass as 'icing.'" Morrison said he will most likely return to form when he works out for Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia, but wouldn't be too shocked if he had a near-total breakdown during his workout for Atlanta.
