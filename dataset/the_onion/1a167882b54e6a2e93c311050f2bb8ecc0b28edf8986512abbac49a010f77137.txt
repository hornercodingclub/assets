IRVINE, CA--Saying he doesn't even feel like trying anymore, 8-year-old Max Bledsoe expressed his strong disappointment Monday after learning that his parents' love is unconditional. "I always thought they loved me because I'd actually earned it, but unfortunately it turns out that their affection is apparently limitless," said a frustrated Bledsoe, wondering aloud the point of doing well in school, learning how to play the piano, and always going to bed before 9 p.m. if his parents were just going to keep on loving him no matter what. "Look at me: I just wasted the last three years of my life trying to win their approval by being a good kid. And for what? To get the love that was coming to me anyway?" Bledsoe added that he envied his adopted younger brother, who really has to work for his parents' love.
