ST. LOUIS--Following the announcement of the 25th annual Home Run Derby lineup Tuesday, injured Red Sox pitcher John Smoltz was perplexed to hear he had been selected from among baseball's top sluggers as one of the eight players to compete. "I don't really see how that's possible. I've been recovering from shoulder surgery for most of the season, and as a member of the American League, I won't even be batting this year," said Smoltz, a lifetime .160 hitter with five career home runs. "Hitting home runs is hard for me. Why is this happening?" Smoltz crushed 26 dingers in a batting practice session that afternoon.
