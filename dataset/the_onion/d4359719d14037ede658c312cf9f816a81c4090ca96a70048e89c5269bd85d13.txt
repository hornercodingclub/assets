WASHINGTON--Highlighting its strong showing at the first presidential debate Monday, a Gallup report released this morning revealed that hopeless resignation has received a substantial bump in the polls. "Our real-time polling data from last night's presidential debate showed a clear trend, with hopeless resignation charting higher and higher as the evening progressed--it really seemed to resonate with viewers," said Gallup spokesperson Sarah Langley, who noted that hopeless resignation's current surge far surpassed the boost it experienced following the conventions, spiking to the highest level of the election cycle. "Last night was easily the biggest moment of the campaign season for hopeless resignation, and I think most Americans recognized that. Clearly, many voters who were on the fence were convinced by what they saw in the debate." Langley added that if current trends continue, hopeless resignation is likely to reach a historic high in the polls by Election Day.
