NEW YORK--Cheering and exchanging high fives in the teeming pedestrian intersection, an estimated one million enthusiastic soccer fans reportedly crowded into a confetti-strewn Times Square Monday to celebrate as the United States unveiled its preliminary roster for this summer's World Cup tournament. "Woo! Team USA, let's do this!" said local man Brett Fahey, whose voice reportedly could barely be heard above the clamor of his fellow die-hard supporters of the U.S. men's national soccer team as they filled the bustling outdoor tourist hub well past capacity. "Man, I sure hope Omar Gonzalez makes the final cut, don't you? He and [Michael] Parkhurst are two of the best defenders in the MLS, no question!" At press time, an outburst of pent-up anger over Team USA's heartbreaking 3-2 loss to Brazil in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup had caused the celebration to turn violent, forcing the New York Police Department to deploy nearly 1,000 fully armed SWAT officers in a futile attempt to quell the swarm of zealous, soccer-loving fans.
