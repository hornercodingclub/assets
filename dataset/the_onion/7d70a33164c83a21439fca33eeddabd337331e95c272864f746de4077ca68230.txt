BOSTON--After living in residence halls during his first three semesters at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, sophomore student Dzhokar Tsarnaev was finally able to get a place of his own and move off campus this week, the 19-year-old told reporters. "Last semester I shared a double room with a guy at Pine Dale Hall, but now I've got a place off campus with no roommate, which is nice," the engineering student said of his new living arrangements, a 10-by-10-foot room located on the first floor of a decommissioned military base about an hour and 40 minutes north from the university. "It's been pretty sweet so far. The building is really safe, I don't have to share a sink with anyone, and living off campus is a lot cheaper than the dorms. Of course, the downside is that the neighbors suck. But I've been thinking about this for a long time now, so I'm glad I finally did it." Tsarnaev added that although he's no longer required to be on a meal plan, he decided to sign up for the 10-meal-per week option and add some extra Dining Dollars.
