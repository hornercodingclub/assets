PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA--Citing safety concerns for both competitors and spectators, representatives from the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday that the 2018 Winter Olympics have been cancelled due to weather conditions being far too cold. "Because of a combination of subfreezing temperatures and the fact that many of the event spaces are now covered in snow and ice, this year's Winter Games have unfortunately been called off," said IOC President Thomas Bach, noting that it would be irresponsible to expose athletes to an increased risk of slipping and falling in the frozen conditions, especially in already dangerous sports such as downhill skiing and figure skating. "We even considered having participants wear bulky protective coats, gloves, and hats, but ultimately realized this would have a negative effect on both performance and viewing enjoyment. We extend our sincerest apologies to all those who were excited to watch and participate in the events, but it has become clear that it is simply too cold to move forward." At press time, the IOC has tentatively rescheduled the Winter Games for June of 2022.
