INDIANAPOLIS--Tired of being overlooked by everyone in his precinct, unpopular Indianapolis Police Department officer Kyle Norris told reporters Wednesday he was considering committing a racially motivated offense to generate a little support. "To be honest, I'm not the most well-known or looked-up-to guy around here, but I'm thinking that if I get caught up in a controversy after shooting a minority resident under questionable circumstances, things would really change for me," said Norris, who added that having his coworkers immediately rally around him after the incident, watching consecutive nights of public demonstrations defending his actions, and finally receiving praise directly from the chief of police would be a nice change of pace from his day-to-day life as an ignored and unappreciated member of the force. "Obviously, I'd take some heat from some citizens, but I think it would be worth it when just as many people respond by openly speaking about my exemplary record as an officer and calling me a pillar of the community. No one's ever said that about me before. If this thing gets big enough, I might even see some people on Twitter and TV calling me a hero--that would feel good." Norris added that it would probably also be a nice little boost when the 12 members of his jury take less than an hour to declare him not guilty.
