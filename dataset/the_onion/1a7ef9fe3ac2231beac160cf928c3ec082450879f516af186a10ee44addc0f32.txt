NORRISTOWN, PA--Expressing relief that cultural norms had finally shifted in his favor, Bill Cosby was reportedly feeling better about his retrial Monday now that the climate around sexual assault has cooled down. "I'm definitely more optimistic than I was a few months ago," said the 80-year-old entertainer who stands accused of three counts of aggravated indecent assault, noting that his previous trial had occurred during a time when holding abusers accountable for their actions was still very much in the zeitgeist. "Back in June, being accused of drugging and raping more than 60 women was still such a hot-button issue that I was barely able to squeak by with a mistrial. But now that movements like 'Me Too' and 'Time's Up' have basically blown over, all this unpleasantness should be finished in no time." Cosby added that he felt particularly hopeful since the broad societal trend of millionaires facing no consequences for their actions was still going strong.
