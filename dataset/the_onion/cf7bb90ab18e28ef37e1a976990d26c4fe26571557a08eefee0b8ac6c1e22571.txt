IRVING, TX--Despite having frequently visited NFL locker rooms for several years, sports reporter Adam Laverty confirmed Monday that he's still not accustomed to the sight of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones walking around naked after every home game. "At the end of the day, it's a locker room, so you definitely expect to see guys changing in there, but it still feels a little weird when Jerry comes out of the showers dripping wet and totally nude," said Laverty, adding that it is not uncommon for the 71-year-old to playfully snap towels at Cowboys players in the middle of postgame interviews with reporters. "He'll stand there toweling off for 20 minutes, and then he'll do a few laps around the locker room with absolutely nothing on, talking to different players and giving his thoughts on the game. It's very distracting." Laverty confirmed the situation has become increasingly awkward since he noticed that the discolored mole on Jones' scrotum has been growing larger every week.
