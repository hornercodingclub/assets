VATICAN CITY--Quickly scanning the alley to make sure no one would see him with the scraps he had placed on a spare offering plate, Pope Francis reportedly stepped out the back door of St. Peter's Basilica late Wednesday night and slipped leftovers to the false god Moloch. "I know I should be forsaking him, but what am I supposed to do, let the poor thing starve?" said the pontiff, cooing in Aramaic as he fed uneaten portions of chicken casserole to the bull-headed Canaanite god of child sacrifice. "Maybe it's heretical of me, but just look at the guy--he's nothing but skin and bones and horns. If I don't take care of him, who will?" Reached for comment, the heathen idol Moloch expressed appreciation for the leftovers, but confirmed he could only be fully satiated by consuming the flesh of a living man-child set forth in offering upon a burning pyre.
