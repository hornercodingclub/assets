NEW YORK--Shrugging their shoulders and looking helplessly at each other, baffled players on the 22-35 Milwaukee Bucks had no idea what to do with the basketball Wednesday following a defensive rebound by center Andrew Bogut. "Um, so now what?" Bogut said, clutching the ball to prevent it from accidentally bouncing on the floor. "Man, this thing is really round. Should I be rolling it somewhere? Wow, coach is doing his angry jumping. Is he pointing at me? He is, but I definitely have shoes on this time. Oh, I think he's signaling me to waste another timeout." Despite the confusion, a majority of the Bucks agreed that Bogut should either slowly walk over to the referee and hand him the ball, or do what he did the last time, which was throw it as far and as high into the stands as possible.
