NEW YORK--ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith recently made several dismissive remarks about ice hockey this week, causing Americans across the country to flock to the sport in droves, sources confirmed Sunday. "Up until about a week ago, I never cared about hockey one way or the other, but ever since I saw Stephen A. Smith criticize the game, I've been a huge fan," said local man Paul Bradford, echoing the sentiment of millions of Americans, who since the polemical sportscaster derided hockey have fanatically followed every wrinkle of the newly popular sport. "He said he doesn't like it when a hockey game is low-scoring. Well, I love when that happens. Because I love hockey. It's my favorite sport." Bradford added that, in a further show of solidarity against any and all of Smith's viewpoints, he and the rest of the nation would continue not watching the NBA.
