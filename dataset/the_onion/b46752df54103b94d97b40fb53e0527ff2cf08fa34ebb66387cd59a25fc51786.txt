OAKLAND, CA--Claiming to be very eager to learn anything about the team's successful yet mysterious tactics, Americans across the nation reportedly expressed their keen interest Friday in the Oakland A's winning formula for remaining consistently competitive over the past decade. "Year after year, the A's win an above-average number of games even though they're on a far smaller budget than most teams--how do they keep doing that?" said Lowell, MA resident Jake Hughes, 28, adding that someone should at least interview GM Billy Beane and, if possible, get an inside look at the way Oakland's front office operates. "I suppose it could be pure luck, but something tells me there's more to the story than that. I wonder--and this is all purely conjecture, of course--if they have some sort of unique system in place to get the optimal value for their payroll: a 'fiscal ballgame,' if you will. Whatever they're doing, it's unorthodox, and I'd love to know about it, especially within the context of baseball history and the game's more conventional practices." Despite their curiosity about the franchise's strategy, Americans confirmed that they would not be interested in anything beyond a single magazine article on the subject.
