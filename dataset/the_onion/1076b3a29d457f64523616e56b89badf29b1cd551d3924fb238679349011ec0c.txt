FAIRFAX, VA--In response to the March For Our Lives protest led by student activists who survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the National Rifle Association reportedly issued a statement Monday calling for more common-sense gun deaths. "Now, more than ever, what we need are more shooting deaths resulting from defending one's family from home invaders or getting revenge--the types of clear, logical gun deaths with widespread approval," said NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, adding that the contentious national conversation on gun control overlooked many common-sense gun deaths that both sides could agree on. "We believe that owning a gun is a Second Amendment right, and the solution here is certainly not harsher gun deaths. We can avoid senseless tragedies by encouraging more Americans to kill someone with a firearm in a more defensible and reasonable way. I'm sure we all can agree that we'd rather see a teen accidentally shoot their friend from a deer blind or unintentionally kill their sibling after finding their parents' rifle under the bed than turn a gun on their classmates. We're calling on law enforcement to kill more African Americans during traffic stops and more people with mental health issues to use guns for suicide--the kinds of gun deaths that we as Americans can live with." LaPierre also told reporters that any action on the issue should take inspiration from the kinds of common-sense gun deaths in other countries perpetuated by American soldiers.
