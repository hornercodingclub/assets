NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ--Taken aback by the packaging's unexpected honesty and directness, sources expressed surprise Wednesday upon noticing that a can of brand-name aerosol disinfectant was so forthright about giving you cancer. "Look, it says 'CONTAINS KNOWN CARCINOGENS' almost as big as the Lysol logo--damn, they really went for it," said 29-year-old resident Maureen Benthos as she inspected the can while shopping at a local Target, pointing out that the container had the word 'carcinogenic' in three other places, all in bold, red lettering. "They didn't even try to obscure it with scientific language or fine print. It basically just says 'cancer' all over this thing. Wow." Several consumers expressed frustration at the labeling, however, noting that it was nowhere near as candid about how high it will get you.
