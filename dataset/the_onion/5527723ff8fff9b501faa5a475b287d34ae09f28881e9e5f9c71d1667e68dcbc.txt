BOSTON--Tallying various efforts to act natural and pretend everything was fine, a study published Wednesday by researchers at Boston University found that the average American hopes no one saw that 12 times per day. "Over the course of a 24-hour period, a typical American prays to God about a dozen times that nobody noticed what just happened," said the report's lead author, Dr. Sheryl Rasmussen, adding that such events might be evenly dispersed among one's waking hours or concentrated in a shorter, intensely mortifying time span. "Approximately every other hour, the average American will worriedly look over their shoulder and dart their eyes to make sure that no one caught a glimpse of what just took place, although it's not uncommon for people to casually pull out their phone like nothing whatsoever occurred or simply stare straight ahead." The study confirmed, however, that in all such instances, everyone saw and was savagely judging the person involved.
