RUTLAND, VT--Despite being seen weeping as she left the room 15 minutes ago, area woman Rebecca Fordham, 35, apparently expects to easily and unobtrusively slip right back into the party and continue socializing as if nothing had happened, sources confirmed Saturday evening. "Oh, hey guys," said Fordham, somehow thinking she could casually just re-enter a lighthearted party conversation like everything was normal, despite her eyes now being visibly red and puffy from sobbing audibly through a locked bedroom door. "What's everybody drinking?" At press time, sources said Fordham had excused herself from a group of friends, entered the bathroom, and begun crying again.
