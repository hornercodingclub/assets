INDIANAPOLIS--Noting that he had already made the same mistake during his last three pit stops, NASCAR driver Martin Truex Jr. expressed frustration Sunday after once again forgetting which side of his car the gas tank is on. "Goddammit, I do this every time," said Truex, carefully watching for other cars driving past him at 200 miles per hour as he attempted to perform a three-point turn in the middle of the speedway. "My old No. 56 car had it on the left side--why the hell don't they just put them all on the same side for every car? Screw it, I'm just going to go all the way around the track and then come back in the right way." At press time, Truex's pit crew was quietly waiting next to the car while he repeatedly jiggered the lever below his seat in an attempt to pop open the gas tank door.
