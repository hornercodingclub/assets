FOXBOROUGH, MA--A new autobiography by New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady gives readers a behind-the-scenes look at the ups and even greater ups of being the three-time Super Bowl champion, sources confirmed Friday. "From the highest highs of winning two NFL MVP awards and marrying a Brazilian supermodel, to the more moderate highs of being a record-setting quarterback for the University of Michigan, this memoir is very personal and doesn't hold back," said Bryce Joplin, a representative from the book's publisher, Hyperion, adding that goes on sale Tuesday. "On the one hand, readers will see the side of Tom they already know from the football field--a good-looking millionaire who is constantly winning--but on the other, they'll finally learn who Tom is off the field: a constant winner who is also a good-looking millionaire." Brady was not available for comment, as he was eating filet mignon at the best steakhouse in Boston while waiting for a call concerning a $20 million endorsement deal with Rolex.
