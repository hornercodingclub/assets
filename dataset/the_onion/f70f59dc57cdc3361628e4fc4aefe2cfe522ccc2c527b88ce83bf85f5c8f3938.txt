LOS ANGELES--A day after his team's 118-111 loss to the Phoenix Suns, perennial all-star Kobe Bryant pulled his 49 points from the Lakers' official score sheet Monday and announced he would donate them to a more beneficial cause. "There are a lot of people out there who need these points more than I do," said Bryant, who has accumulated a fortune of more than 23,000 points during his 13-year career. "Habitat for Humanity could put some points toward giving someone a home, and St. Jude children's hospital could use it to cure childhood cancer.... As one of the world's highest scorers, I need to be a more responsible role model." Reactions of Laker players and fans were mixed when Bryant declared that 10 percent of all his subsequent points would go to the ASPCA.
