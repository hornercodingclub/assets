Cleansed, an ongoing play at the National Theatre in London, is causing several audience members to faint in their seats with its vivid depictions of rape, torture, and dismemberment. What do think? "If I'm going to sit through two hours of grisly violence, I'll see it in IMAX with no intermission." Avery Lakin * Reptile Groomer "Oh, it's no more graphic than that scene in Cats where Grizabella eats her young." Elmer Wertz * Pencil Distributor "I guess I'm more worried about anyone who gives the show a standing ovation." Nolan Landers * Paranormal Litigator
