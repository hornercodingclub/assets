LOS ANGELES--A clause stipulating that free agent Manny Ramirez show up to games on time and play baseball to the greatest extent of his ability became a major sticking point in contract negotiations between the left fielder and the Dodgers, Ramirez's agent Scott Boras told reporters after Ramirez finally agreed to terms Wednesday. "We were willing to bend on the showing up part, but if they wanted my client to actually care about winning while he is up to bat, running the base paths, and fielding both fly and ground balls, well, that would have cost them at least another $17 million," Boras said. "If we gave in on that, then they'd have felt free to renege on the clause that allows Manny to play while wearing a bathing suit, a Kobe Bryant jersey, and sandals." Ramirez was too entranced by the guy at Venice Beach who rides a unicycle while holding two king cobra snakes to comment.
