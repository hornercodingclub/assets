TRENTON, NJ--Praising his Halloween costume as "extremely realistic," employees at local software firm Sterling Data Analytics confirmed Thursday that boss Donald Barlow has come into the office dressed as a guy who's firing Sean. "Wow, he absolutely nailed it," marketing associate Susan Dominguez told reporters, adding that Barlow's depiction of a stern middle manager who, due to Sean's recent performance issues, is forced to lay him off is "absolutely perfect." "He's got a suit on and this really serious look on his face just like a man who's about to explain to Sean that his position has been terminated, effective immediately, and that he needs to clean out his desk and turn in his keycard. Very authentic. And it looks like he just called Sean into his office, too. Man, he's really selling it." At press time, Sterling employees were similarly impressed by Sean's decision to dress up as a weeping man who had just lost his livelihood.
