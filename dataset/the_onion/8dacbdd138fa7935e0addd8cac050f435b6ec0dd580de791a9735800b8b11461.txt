NEW YORK--NFL spokesman Greg Aiello announced Monday that, after years of deliberation, NFL team owners will vote on the proposed construction of a second football stadium in order to ease current difficulties with scheduling and overcrowding. "With 16 games every week and thousands of fans in attendance at each game, you can imagine the wear and tear NFL Field has taken over the past 90 years," Aiello told reporters, adding that parking alone is "a huge problem." "A new stadium could provide state-of-the-art facilities for players, as well as finally allowing teams to practice by themselves instead of conducting massive workouts where every team is on the field at once. Not to mention it would give our workers a lot more time to repaint the end zones between games." Aiello later explained the NFL hoped to one day have stadiums in "host cities" across the country, but admitted that was probably decades away.
