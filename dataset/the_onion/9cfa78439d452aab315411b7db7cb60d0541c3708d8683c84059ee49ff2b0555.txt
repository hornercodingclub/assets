Scientists recently discovered 44,000-year-old jewelry made from ostrich eggs and poison-tipped arrows in a South African cave, a finding that suggests modern human culture emerged more than 20,000 years earlier than previously believed. What do think? "Well, I still say we don't look a day over 18,000 years old." Marjorie Speck * Boarding House Manager "To find that we've had 20,000 more years to develop culturally just means there's that much more to feel ashamed about." Jack Slyter * Probate Lawyer "Something definitely got lost over time, because my own poison-tipped arrows can't kill for shit." William Sheedy * Lumber Sorter
