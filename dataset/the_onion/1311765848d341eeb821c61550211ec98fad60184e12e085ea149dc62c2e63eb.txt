In an effort to control the Everglades' population of invasive Burmese Pythons, which can grow to 20 feet long, Florida officials opened a month-long hunting contest in which professional and amateur snake hunters will compete for cash prizes based on the number of snakes they kill. What do think? "I hope they don't kill any of the cute little 10-foot pythons." Georgina Stader * Dietitian "What a thrill for amateur snake hunters to be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the pros of snake hunting!" Gil Sabine * Rod Bending Machine Operator "I predict this will end badly for someone. Most likely someone who puts a lot of time and effort into this contest and comes up short by a few snakes."
