ANN ARBOR, MI--Saying that he had hardly noticed the time go by while receiving the series of electrically induced seizures, University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh was reportedly disappointed Friday upon learning that his electroshock therapy session was over so soon. "Oh, is our time up already?" Harbaugh was overheard saying as doctors carefully removed electrodes from his forehead that were used to deliver dozens of 450-volt shocks over the course of his 45-minute session. "These sessions are my favorite part of the week, but they always seem to go by so quickly. Well, I'm looking forward to picking this up where we left off when I come back next time." Harbaugh added that he considered the moment during the session when he began uncontrollably vomiting to be a "real breakthrough" in his treatment.
