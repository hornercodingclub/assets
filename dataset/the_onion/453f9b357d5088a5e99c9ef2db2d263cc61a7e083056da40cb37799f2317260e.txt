WASHINGTON--Instructing workers to be on the lookout for a pretty huge package labeled "Fragile," Vice President Joe Biden visited the White House mailroom Friday to check for the arrival of a grow light he'd had delivered under a fake name, multiple sources reported. "You guys know if any boxes arrived for a Robert Marley?" Biden reportedly asked in a low tone of voice, noting that the parcel would be shipped from a company called Photonics, Inc. in Vancouver, and that maybe his buddy Chip who works nights had already set it aside. "Long story, but I had a little mishap with my rig a few weeks ago and some of the guys on the Plantazoid forums said this thing is the shit." At press time, the vice president was seen furtively slipping into the Lincoln Bedroom closet with a load of tinfoil he had taken from the White House kitchen.
