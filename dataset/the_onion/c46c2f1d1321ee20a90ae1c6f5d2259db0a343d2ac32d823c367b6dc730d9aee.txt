SOMERVILLE, MA--Awkwardly reengaging with the small cluster of people in the corner of his coworker's living room, party guest David Kirsch reportedly came crawling right back to a conversation he thought he could do better than, sources confirmed over the weekend. "Hey, so I just remembered that I actually had seen a long time ago, but that's the only one of the old films I've watched," said the humiliated Kirsch, who reportedly circled back to the discussion about and other current movies a mere five minutes after extricating himself from the group in search of a more stimulating exchange. "I should check out the others, but I don't know how they're gonna top ." According to sources, Kirsch attempted to finish his drink as quickly as possible in order to have an excuse to detach himself from the conversation a second time.
