THE HEAVENS--Following the game-ending interception against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX, God Almighty, Creator and Supreme Ruler of the Universe, confirmed Monday that He "can't fucking stand Russell Wilson" and that the Seattle Seahawks star quarterback "can go fuck himself." "I hate Russell Wilson, so fuck him, and fuck the Seahawks," said the Heavenly Father, adding that Jermaine Kearse's incredible catch on Seattle's final drive was indeed a case of divine intervention, but only so Wilson could then throw an interception that cost his team the Super Bowl. "I mean, the look on his face right after I made him throw that pick on the goal line was just priceless. He's so fucking annoying, so I wanted to get his hopes up and then crush him in front of the whole world. Self-righteous little prick." Despite subsequently allowing the Patriots to win their fourth Super Bowl title, God also clarified that Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and Robert Kraft are all "dirty fucking cheats" who will spend an eternity in Hell after they die.
