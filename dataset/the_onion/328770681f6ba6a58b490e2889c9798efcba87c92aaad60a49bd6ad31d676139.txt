WASHINGTON--Shedding light on how the nation managed its wealth, a study released Thursday by the Pew Research Center revealed that Americans conduct the vast majority of their financial planning when figuring out how to get their money's worth at an all-you-can-eat buffet. "Our data show that Americans devote the greatest amount of attention to allocating their resources when determining how much value they can wring from the offerings at their local Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral," said lead researcher Michelle Keene, noting that more than half the study's participants indicated they would head immediately for big-ticket items like the roast beef, ham, or fried chicken, while approximately 30 percent opted to arrive just as breakfast transitioned to lunch in an effort to enjoy two meals at once. "Whether individuals concoct a plan to refrain from eating anything too heavy several hours before arriving, or only order water so as to avoid the empty calories of a soda, the average American shows an unprecedented level of foresight and long-term thinking while heaping their plate with the most expensive meat and seafood." Keene cautioned that the research did uncover anomalies, noting that the vast majority of Americans abandoned any notion of stretching their dollar upon encountering a steaming-hot tray of fresh waffle fries.
