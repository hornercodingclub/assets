SpaceX, the privately owned spaceflight company, is planning to launch a robotic capsule to the International Space Station this Saturday. What do think? "I just don't trust the private sector to properly equip a rocket the way the government does. What happens if they need to make some triplicate forms up there?"

Lou Hogan * Systems Analyst "Our collective better get to work on the first anarcho-syndicalist-owned capsule right away, then." Isaac Guinn * Heel Compressor
