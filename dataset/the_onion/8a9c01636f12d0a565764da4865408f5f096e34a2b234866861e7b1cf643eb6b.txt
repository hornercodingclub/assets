NEW YORK--In an effort to minimize the risk of traumatic brain injury, a new NFL safety rule going into effect Friday will require all players to be careful. "As part of the NFL's ongoing effort to ensure players are as safe as possible, they will now all be obligated to watch it out there," said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, adding that players not taking it easy would be subject to a fine as well as a mandatory four-game suspension. "Football can be a little physical sometimes, so we want all players to just exercise some caution when blocking, tackling, or doing pretty much anything on the field. When it comes to safety, we're really all on the same team." At press time, the number of players suffering from concussions had dropped to nearly zero.
