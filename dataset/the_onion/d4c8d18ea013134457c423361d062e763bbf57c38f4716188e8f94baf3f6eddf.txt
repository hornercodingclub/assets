LOS ANGELES--Telling them that a first-quarter illegal use of hands is something that will stick with them for the rest of their game, Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul reportedly spent Wednesday afternoon encouraging an assembly of students at Waterloo Elementary School to stay out of foul trouble. "I used to get in foul trouble a lot as a kid, and I don't want to see that happen to you guys," said the seven-time All-Star, adding that the fourth- and fifth-graders need to consider the consequences before attempting to take a charge when they already have three fouls on the books or senselessly risking a reach-in while trying to steal the ball. "You need to play with discipline on defense, and try not to hang around places like the low block. Most importantly, don't ever be afraid to sub out. There's no shame in asking for a sub." According to sources, Paul also told the children to call a timeout and speak to their coach if a full-court press is ever making them feel trapped.
