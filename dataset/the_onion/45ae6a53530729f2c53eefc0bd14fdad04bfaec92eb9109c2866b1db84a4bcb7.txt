WHEELING, OH--Feeling the earth shake beneath them as they watched the procession climb over the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains toward their village, sources along the Ohio border confirmed Thursday that the sight of 400 war elephants marching on the horizon marked Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's arrival to the critical swing state. "Be still; some vast legion is headed our way!" said local automotive worker Dustin Collins, 35, who, like thousands of Wheeling residents, heard the rhythmic, thunderous beating of the cavalcade's 10-foot-wide drums and immediately rushed to a window to gaze upon the advancing ranks. "Behold the standard-bearers at the head of each column, and lo, make out the trumpets' piercing tones. It can only be the great armies of Hillary emerging from her stronghold in the East!" At press time, a large shadow had been cast over the city after the campaign released thousands of shrieking falcons into the air.
