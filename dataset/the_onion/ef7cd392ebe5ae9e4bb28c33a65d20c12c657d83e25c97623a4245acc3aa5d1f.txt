A Milwaukee online security firm discovered this week that a Russian crime ring has stolen 1.2 billion username and password combinations from internet users, the largest theft of its kind in history, and are using most of the information to send out spam in exchange for a fee. What do think? "I don't know which is worse: that gangsters stole 1.2 billion passwords, or that a security firm in Milwaukee was the only one to notice." Michael Guish * Windshield Installer "Is my eBay password one of them? Because it would be a huge help if they could remind me what it was." Sally Bregman * Surface Duster "This is exactly the kind of impetus I needed to finally get serious about online security for an hour or so." Keith Fox * Systems Analyst
