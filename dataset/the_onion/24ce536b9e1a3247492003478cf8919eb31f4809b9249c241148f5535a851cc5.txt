ATLANTA--Following his dominating performance at this year's Tour Championship, in which he not only ran free of the field with an overpowering eight-shot victory but also took home the first ever FedEx Cup Championship, 13-time major winner Tiger Woods told reporters Sunday that he is looking to participate in a more competitive golf tour during the 2008 season. "Don't get me wrong--I love to play golf, I love to win, and I've loved the time I've spent on the PGA Tour, but winning this easily isn't making me any better," said Woods, adding that he has been searching online and making numerous phone calls to locate a golf tour where the players are "at least twice as good as the opponents I've faced up until now." "It's not about the money, as I'll play for free if I know I'm being pushed to even half of my ability." Woods added that he would consider playing certain PGA Tour events next year if Commissioner Tim Finchem allows him to spot the field 10 strokes, play at night, and use only a single golf ball and a 2-iron.
