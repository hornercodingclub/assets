What do think? "Oh please, the president simply meant that a vast majority of Jews are either stupid or actively pledging allegiance to another country." Suzanna Lam * Wind Chime Jingler "See? A real anti-Semite never would've implied there's a small minority of trustworthy Jews." Ted Watts * Foot Stylist "The Torah is very clear that only Republican Jews are God's chosen people."
