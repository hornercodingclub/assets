Abake Assongba, a New York woman who with her husband contributed $50,000 to the Obama campaign, is accused of defrauding people out of more than $650,000 and using the money to build a house. What do think? "Can this donor get around the charge by declaring herself a corporation? Then I think she'd be in the clear." Alan Tapia * Paster "Obviously Obama has to give the money back, but as a gesture of good faith, he should also burn their house down." Katie Warren * Register Repairer "I hope no one vets me. I donated $5, and one time I stole a bracelet from Target." Dan Thompson * MVA-Reactor Operator
