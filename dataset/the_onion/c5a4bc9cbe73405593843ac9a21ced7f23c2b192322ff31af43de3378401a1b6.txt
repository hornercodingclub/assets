NBA commissioner David Stern announced Thursday he will step down from his post on Feb. 1, 2014, 30 years to the day after he began his tenure. What do think? "First Jordan retires and now Stern, too? This has been the worst nine years of my life." "Not to worry--I hear there's a lot of good, unknown commissioning talent over in Europe." "It just won't be the same watching someone else oversee lockouts, nonsensical franchise relocations, and completely needless overexpansion."
