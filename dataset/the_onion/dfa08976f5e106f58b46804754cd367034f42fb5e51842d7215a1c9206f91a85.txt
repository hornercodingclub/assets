LOS ANGELES--Saying they wanted the editorial staff at online media company Insightable to be creative and really play around with it, representatives from Suncoast Snackfoods reportedly emphasized Monday that, when creating the corporation's new branded entertainment, the digital publisher should just have fun with the whole thing. "We love your brand and everything that it produces, so we just want you to have a good time with this and come up with something that gets excited," said Suncoast advertising manager Steve Reynolds, assuring Insightable staffers that as long as they were happy with the concept they put together for a series of sponsored 90-second videos, his corporation would be happy, too. "Coming up with great, engaging ideas is what you do best, so we are just so thrilled to see what kind of exciting content you can create for our brand. If it's something that you like and would share with your friends, it'll be perfect for us." At press time, Suncoast had rejected all 10 ideas submitted for their approval, returned them with heavy markups, and demanded that the next round of proposals all prominently feature the phrase "Sharp'n'Zesty Nacho Dippers."
