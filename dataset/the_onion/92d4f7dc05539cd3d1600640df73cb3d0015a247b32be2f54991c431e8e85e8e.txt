WASHINGTON--Explaining that they needed time to properly inform the public about instances in which the commander in chief had knowingly made false claims, the nation's fact-checkers confirmed Tuesday that they'll probably wrap up evaluating President Trump's statements by 2050 at the latest. "As we've seen numerous times, the president has a tendency to stretch the veracity of objective fact, but we're confident that we'll have finished fully assessing the truthfulness of his claims within the next several decades," said PolitiFact researcher Gregory Wu, stressing that the country's fact-checkers wanted to take their time and thoroughly vet all declarations made by the president in order to ensure that they could compile a complete list of corrections within the next half century. "We're working around the clock, which is why we're currently on pace to finish fact-checking everything President Trump said during his first 100 days in office by the late 2020s. It's crucial for us to carefully examine every word and phrase in order to determine whether the president is deliberately lying and using false information, or whether he simply misspoke or was taken out of context. By 2050, we expect to have fact-checked every one of President Trump's public statements, interviews, state speeches, and extemporaneous remarks so that American voters can make an informed decision about the president's relationship with the truth." At press time, a new speech at a campaign rally by Trump had forced the fact-checkers to push back their deadline to 2075.
