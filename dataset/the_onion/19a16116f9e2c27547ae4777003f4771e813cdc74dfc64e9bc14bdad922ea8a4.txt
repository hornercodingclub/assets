"If MacCoins are just coins that get yo u Big Macs, then I already have a whole jar full of those." Peter Craig * Beer Flight Assembler  "The hoarder in me wants to hold onto the coin, but the slob in me wants a second Big Mac." Jessica Flagg * Fish Candaller "My family prefers to celebrate important days like this privately at home." Randall Johnson * Caviar Scooper
