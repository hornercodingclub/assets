ORLANDO--Magic center Dwight Howard shared his love of books with boys and girls at the Orlando Public Library for five hours Saturday, teaching the group of 10-year-olds the basic fundamentals of shooting paperbacks, hardcovers, and even full sets of reference books into a nearby wastebasket as part of a community outreach program to promote literacy. "Books allowed me to escape the troubled Atlanta streets," Howard said, telling the children how, as a child, he would spend countless hours perfecting his jump shot, lay-up, and even dunks with the reading material at his local library. "Books helped me to fulfill my potential by showing me that anything is possible, as long as you focus on the hole of the garbage can rim and stay smooth on your follow-through." While Howard emphasized to the children the importance of foot placement, bending their knees, and stabilizing the book and guiding it, he stressed it was also vital to run to the trashcan following the shot to maximize offensive rebound opportunities.
