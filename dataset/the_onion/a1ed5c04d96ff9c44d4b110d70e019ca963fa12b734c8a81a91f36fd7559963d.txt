Marvel Comics has announced that the character Thor will now be represented as a woman, though she will still be referred to as the "God of Thunder" and wield the hammer of Thor, with officials explaining that "if we can accept Thor as a frog and a horse-faced alien, we should be able to accept a woman." What do think? "Hopefully this will inspire all the young girls out there who dream of one day wielding the enchanted hammer Mjolnir." Gary Fotchman * Unemployed "Finally, the world is ready to accept a beautiful, blond, Scandinavian woman." Macland Pierce * Snorkel Shack Owner "As long as the character is still white."
