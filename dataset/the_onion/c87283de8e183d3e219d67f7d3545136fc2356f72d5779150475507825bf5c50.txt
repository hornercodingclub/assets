MISSOULA, MT--Describing how he suddenly found himself overwhelmed by a flood of intense emotions, local man Mike Bentzen told reporters Monday the reality of fatherhood didn't truly set in for him until the moment he held his newborn son's hospital bill. "Wow, this is going to totally change my life," said Bentzen as tears welled up in his eyes, adding that he was left completely speechless by the little bundle of papers and that it would probably take some time before the magnitude of what had just happened fully sank in. "I've had friends tell me about their experience, but you just can't understand what it feels like until you're looking down at it in your own hands. It's hard to even put into words. Whatever my world was like before, I just know things are going to be very different from this day forward." Bentzen reportedly started softly weeping as he sat down with his son's medical invoice in his lap and began imagining how he would deal with this for the next 18 years.
