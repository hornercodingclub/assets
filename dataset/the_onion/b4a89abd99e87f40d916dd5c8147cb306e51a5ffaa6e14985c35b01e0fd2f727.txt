NOVI, MI--Ignoring the ever-looming specter of his own mortality, sources confirmed that local web designer Spencer Krone devoted a rapidly fleeting portion of his finite life Thursday evening to participating in a mock draft for his Yahoo! Sports Fantasy Baseball league "Diggin' For Goldschmidt." "Dammit, somebody already got Mike Trout," Krone reportedly said as his every breath brought him closer to the inevitable end of his time on earth, with the 26-year-old having chosen to dedicate over two hours of his brief yet precious existence to a full 23-round practice run of an upcoming fantasy draft. "Hope I can still get McCutchen. McCutchen's really good." At press time, Krone, who will reportedly never have the chance to relive his mid-20s, had just made a note that Los Angeles Angels third baseman David Freese could be a quality sleeper pick late in the draft.
