The National Weather Service reported a new record for number of tornadoes in a day, with 312 counted in a 24-hour period last week. What do think? "That's a lot of math. Maybe they should have been doin' more tornado catchin' and less tornado countin'." Lisa Grohl * Pull-Tab Dispenser Stocker "My God. Just think of how many thousands of anecdotes about things being driven several inches into the sides of other things were spawned during that 24-hour period." Bill Mojica * Bit Tapper "Are you really trying to talk to me about the weather? Man, I hate small talk." Matthew Gregory * Unemployed
