WASHINGTON--Saying the White House contenders have been coming on strong and seem unable to take a hint, the nation told reporters Monday it was unsure what signals it had given off to make the 2016 candidates for president of the United States think it would be into them. "I thought I was pretty clear from the start about my lack of interest in these candidates, but apparently they've gotten the impression that I want to get to know them better," said Erica Lockworth, a registered voter in Centerville, OH, adding that she can't remember saying or doing anything that would have led the office-seekers to believe she'd be receptive to their advances. "They've been really trying to sweet-talk me and win me over--they're actually getting a little aggressive about it. The whole situation is awkward, and I feel kind of embarrassed for them, to be honest. I'm flattered and everything, but I just don't see anything worthwhile ever happening between us." The nation added that it found the presidential contenders' behavior especially off-putting given that it was widely known the candidates were already involved in an intimate relationship with wealthy special interests.
