WASHINGTON--A new study published Monday by the University of New Mexico confirmed that the name of the Washington Redskins is only offensive if you take any amount of time whatsoever to think about its actual meaning. "When you hear or say 'Redskins' in the abstract, it's completely harmless, but we've discovered that if you briefly pause to remember it's a racial slur for an indigenous group wiped out by genocide over the course of a few centuries, then, yeah, it's awful," said lead researcher Lawrence Wagner, adding that only if you allow the NFL franchise's name to register in your mind does it evoke the thought of human beings devastated by the forced removal from tribal lands, intentional exposure to smallpox, and countless massacres. "It has the potential to come across as a degrading relic of an ethnocentric mentality responsible for the destruction of an entire people and their culture, but that's only if you take a couple seconds to recognize it as something beyond a string of letters." Wagner recommended that the NFL franchise should change their name to something more appropriate and historically accurate, such as the Washington Racist Fucks.
