MIAMI--While toweling off in front of his vanity mirror Monday, Miami Heat team president Pat Riley stared longingly at a bottle of L'Oreal Studio Line hair gel from 1988, pondering the idea of firing Erik Spoelstra and returning to his position as head coach. "What do you say, old friend?" Riley said to the bottle as he squeezed a dollop of gel into his hand. "Have you got another 70 games in you?" As of press time, Riley was reportedly asking his comb if it still feels like a champion.
