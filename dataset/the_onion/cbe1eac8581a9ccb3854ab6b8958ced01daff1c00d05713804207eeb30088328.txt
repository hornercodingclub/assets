MILWAUKEE--Following news that Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun will sit out the rest of 2013 due to his alleged involvement with performance-enhancing drug supplier Biogenesis, the power hitter's teammates told reporters Tuesday that they were concerned his suspension could put the remainder of the 41-57 ball club's season in jeopardy. "This team is built around Ryan, and I can already tell that we're going to face an uphill battle without him," said starting second baseman Rickie Weeks, emphasizing that he "just couldn't imagine" the team that currently possesses the second-worst record in the National League lasting very long in the postseason without the five-time All-Star. "Obviously, there's a lot of talent in this clubhouse, but the fact is that everything we've been able to do so far this season has been because of Ryan. No doubt about it, we're in trouble. I don't know how we could play in the World Series without him." When reached for comment, Braun told reporters that he believed his team would be able to perform just as well without him.
