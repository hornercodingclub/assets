WASHINGTON--Daydreaming about taking a break from the day-to-day grind of modern life, an overworked U.S. populace announced Wednesday that sometimes it wishes it could just unplug from it all the way they did in Puerto Rico. "Whenever my workday gets hectic, I think about how lucky they are to be on this tropical island where they're totally off the grid and can just relax," Dallas-based financial consultant Erica Dickinson said of the nearly 200,000 residents who have remained without power since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico in September 2017. "I'd give just about anything for some time away from the ol' inbox. Imagine--no emails, no texts, no communication with the outside world for six months? It must be so nice to unwind and get away from all the hustle and bustle like that." At press time, sources confirmed the nation had sighed and expressed its hope that maybe someday that kind of peace and quiet would be available somewhere within the contiguous United States.
