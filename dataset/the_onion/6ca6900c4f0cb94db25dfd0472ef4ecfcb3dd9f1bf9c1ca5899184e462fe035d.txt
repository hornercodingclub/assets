A female jaguar that was part of an Olympic torch relay ceremony in Rio de Janeiro was shot dead after pulling free from her handlers and attacking a soldier, behavior likely induced by the stress of the chaotic environment. What do think? "You definitely want to get the bulk of these preventable deaths out of the way before the Games begin." Max Koon * Ham Chopper "At least she died doing what she loved: trying to escape." Delaney Hitchens * Pillow Fluffer "It's unfortunate. But up until that point, the jaguar was doing a great job serving as a symbol of strength or speed or whatever the hell it was doing there." Hunter Blumhagen * Salad Promoter
