The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday from the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, the Colorado bakery who refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple. The case will determine whether this represented discrimination or an infringement of First Amendment rights. What do think? "I don't like the idea of anyone forcing me to make a cake just because I run a business where I make cakes all day." Cecilia Crossman * Gondola Captain "It just seems wrong that here we are in 2017 and this country still has not set precedent on cake." Richard Portman * Test Subject "This is about more than just one wedding or one country. This is about cake, for God's sake!" Brian Pierce * Systems Analyst
