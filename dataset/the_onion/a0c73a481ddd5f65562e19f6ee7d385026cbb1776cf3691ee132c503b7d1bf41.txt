NEW YORK--NBA commissioner David Stern held a press conference Tuesday to announce that the league had formed a 15-person committee to probe into allegations of players illegally taking steps without dribbling during the annual All-Star Game. "These are very serious accusations of a major rules violation and fans can rest assured knowing the committee will scrutinize game video over the next five weeks to maintain the integrity of the both NBA and the entire All-Star Weekend," Stern said, adding that the 30-person panel was composed of owners, coaches, and former players. "I've conducted private interviews with the game's referees, and I am confident that none of them were aware of any wrongdoing." Stern added that if any players were found guilty of breaking the rule, they would be punished to the full extent of the law.
