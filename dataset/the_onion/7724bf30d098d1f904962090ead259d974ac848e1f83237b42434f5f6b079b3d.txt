Series producer Barbara Broccoli stressed that James Bond will never be cast as a woman under her watch, saying "he can be of any color, but he is male," and adding that "I believe we should be creating new characters for women--strong female characters." What do think? "What if a mishap put the male James Bond in a woman's body? I think that's a good compromise." Cara Dougherty * Appliance Instructor "Couldn't we compromise by just showing Bond having sex with more women?" Oren Peralta * Unemployed "Exactly. James Bond doesn't have a vagina, but rather a penis that changes every decade or so." Bert Drummond * Sandwich Line Foreman
