MILWAUKEE--Going above and beyond the simple proposition of a 12-month lease, a local Craigslist apartment listing reportedly sweetened the pot Tuesday with an offer to sell the current tenant's nearly decade-old furniture, sources confirmed. "Got a couch, bookshelf, and a dining table that I'd be willing to sell--all slightly used but in decent condition," read the highly tempting post, adding even further enticement to the already wildly attractive proposal by offering a modest discount to anyone willing to buy all three of the items, which were themselves purchased secondhand from the previous occupants in 2006. "Let me know if you're interested. I'd be happy to just leave them here for you when I go." The tantalizing listing reportedly went on to add an irresistible cherry on top by offering to leave behind an uneven, heavily scratched end table propped up by a thick wad of masking tape for free.
