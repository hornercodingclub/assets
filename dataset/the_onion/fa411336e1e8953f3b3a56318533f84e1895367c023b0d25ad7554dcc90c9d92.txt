INDIANAPOLIS--Unbeknownst to them, a selection of friends, coworkers, and loose acquaintances of local data entry clerk Brian Lochner make up the 28-year-old's entire emotional support network, sources reported Wednesday. "Brian? Yeah, over the years he and I have gotten drinks after work a bunch of times--definitely a good guy to have around the office," said coworker Jeff Aldriss, oblivious to the fact that he is the first person Lochner would call if the going really got tough and he needed someone to talk him through it. "Brian's a sweet guy; we stop and chat in the hallway of our building a lot and it's always very pleasant," added neighbor Kelly Platt, who would be shocked to learn that even a minor crisis would drive Lochner to lean on her for weeks. Sources confirmed that the group's collective ignorance is expected to continue until June of next year, when Lochner's girlfriend of nine months leaves him following his sudden firing.
