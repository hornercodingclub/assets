SAN FRANCISCO--Struggling Giants pitcher Barry Zito (4.54 ERA), who had shown some progress in his previous two bullpen sessions, gave up a hit on his 14th warm up pitch prior to his start last Tuesday. "You always go in there wanting to bring your best stuff, but sometimes you just don't have it," said Zito in a post-bullpen, pre-game press conference. "I kind of left one hanging there towards the end, and [pitching] Coach [Dave Righetti] got a hold of it." The hit brings Zito's career WHBSP, or Walks and Hits per Bullpen Session Pitched, to a dismal 6.91.
