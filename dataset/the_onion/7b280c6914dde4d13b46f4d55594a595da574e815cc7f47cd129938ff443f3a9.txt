RANCHO SANTA FE, CA--Approaching the halfway point of a solid round of bathing Sunday, Phil Mickelson followed the advice of his shower caddy and used a sudsy 9-iron for his approach shot instead of the shampoo-covered pitching wedge he had originally intended to swing. "Look at the location of the drain and the way the water's running," whispered shower caddy Jim Mackay, removing the loofah from a driver so Mickelson could wash his back between shots. "Just play it safe and avoid the hazard, then worry about making up ground in your next shower." While the advice proved helpful, Mickelson and his caddy unfortunately had a heated exchange only minutes later, when Mackay misread the slope of the tub, causing Mickelson to slip and fall in his attempt to step out.
