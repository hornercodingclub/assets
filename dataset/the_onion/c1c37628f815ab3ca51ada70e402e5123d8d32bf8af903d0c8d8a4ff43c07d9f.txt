Hasbro announced that the least popular Monopoly game piece, the iron, would be removed from the board game and replaced with a cat, which beat out other potential new tokens--a guitar, a robot, a diamond ring, and a helicopter--in an online vote. What do think? "But I was getting so good with the iron!" Rochelle Epper * Dam Tender "Who the hell are all these people who don't want to be a fucking helicopter?" Norman Yant * Abalone Diver "That thing was an iron? My friends always told me it was a spaceship when they made me play with it." Gabriel Struzan * Darkroom Worker
