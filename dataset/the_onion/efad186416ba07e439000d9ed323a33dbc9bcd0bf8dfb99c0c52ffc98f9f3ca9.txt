TORONTO--Despite early concerns about the venue's small size, center Igor Larionov and winger Glenn Anderson were inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame during a 15-minute ceremony over at Steve's place on Howland Avenue. "There are so many people I want to thank for helping me get to this moment, but most of all I want to thank Steve," Larionov said from a podium in the basement next to a running washing machine. "Steve's always been there for the NHL, but to let us come over on such short notice?And to spring for beer on top of that? That's just pure Steve. Let's make sure and plan this better next time so we don't have to put him out like this again." After expressing confidence that the Hall would find a permanent home by the end of the year, Hall of Fame chairman Bill Hay filled his van with folding chairs and drove them back to his buddy Phil's place in Peel Region.
