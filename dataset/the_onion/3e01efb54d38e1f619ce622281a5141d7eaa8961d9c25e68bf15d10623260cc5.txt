NEW YORK--Already eagerly anticipating the team's follow-up to their lackluster performance in Rio, basketball fans across the nation expressed their excitement to reporters Wednesday about the incredible U.S. men's basketball team that will be put together in 2020 as redemption for the 2016 Olympics. "Oh man, that U.S. roster is going to be so stacked in Tokyo to avenge whatever embarrassing loss this team suffers," said 26-year-old Connor Bardell of Emporia, KS, speculating that the powerhouse collection of NBA All-Stars will likely be nicknamed the "Redeem Team II." "Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, maybe even LeBron--they'll all come out next time to put the U.S. back on top as the best team in the world. And since they'll have a huge point to prove, it'll be a huge blowout every single game. God, I can't wait to watch that." Millions of fans also confirmed their eagerness to watch the 2020 team get revenge by beating the shit out of whichever nation ends up defeating the U.S. this summer.
