DENVER--Removing the Middle Eastern specialty from its paper carryout bag as he returned to his office desk, local insurance salesman Robert Devinshire reportedly braced himself Monday to undergo an extensive interrogation from his coworkers about where he got falafel. "Oh, God, before I even get to take one bite of this thing, I know [account managers] Ray [Gallo] and Liz [Farrell] will be over here grilling me, demanding to know the name and location of the restaurant," said Devinshire, worried that the scent of warm, fried chickpea and tahini had already begun attracting colleagues from nearby cubicles, each of whom would soon bombard him with inquiries on whether the restaurant was new or if he grabbed a menu. "It's only a matter of moments before they're surrounding my desk, ordering me to tell them everything I know about how long the line was and cross-examining me about what other dishes were available. I better try to eat this thing quickly before the whole department shows up." At press time, a chewing Devinshire was responding to an onslaught of questions about the sandwich's taste, price, and contents with a series of muffled one-word answers and thumbs-ups.
