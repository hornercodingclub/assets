GRANVILLE, OH--In what many described as "pretty incredible," students at Denison University expressed disbelief Friday after realizing they were actually sitting in the same English 225 class as none other than the school's starting quarterback, Luke Pavlatos. "Holy shit, Pav is here," said sophomore Jared Stasio, who admitted it was difficult to fathom that he was sitting just two seats away from the very quarterback who commands Big Red at Piper Field. "Oh my God, number 8. He's taking a class just like us. I can't believe that they even make him go to class.  I mean you hear his name all the time and I guess you forget he's still a regular student like everybody else.  I just hope I don't say anything stupid in front of him." At press time, the students confirmed that despite being the "King of Denison," Pavlatos was "so down to earth."
