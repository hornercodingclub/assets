NASHVILLE, TN--Timidly approaching members of the Pittsburgh Penguins as they celebrated their championship victory over the Nashville Predators, referee Dan O'Halloran quietly asked several players if he could have a go at hoisting the Stanley Cup, sources confirmed Sunday night. "Hey guys, this has always been kind of a dream of mine, so do you think I could take a turn holding the cup?" O'Halloran was reported to have shyly asked Penguins alternate captain Chris Kunitz after spending several minutes silently lingering just outside the huddle of rejoicing players. "It's just that this is my eighth Stanley Cup, and in that whole time I've never even gotten to touch it. I promise I'll be really quick, and then you can have it right back." At press time, O'Halloran was reportedly standing frozen in horror after dropping the Stanley Cup.
