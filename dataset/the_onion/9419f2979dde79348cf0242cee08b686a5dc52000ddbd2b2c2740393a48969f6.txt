LOS ANGELES--Delivering on a season's worth of awards buzz, the critically acclaimed musical was a big winner at the 85th annual Academy Awards last night after it took home the Oscar for Most Sound. "It's incredibly humbling to accept this award for Most Sound on behalf of our cast and crew," said director Tom Hooper of the film that also took home the Academy Awards for Best Sound Making and Biggest Sounds. "We are all very proud of the sounds in this film, and in a year filled with so many terrifically loud movies, we feel incredibly fortunate to be recognized." In an additional coup for the film, Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Fantine earned her awards for both Best Supporting Actress and Loudest Actress.
