ST. LOUIS-- Saying that he was "too overwhelmed" with memories of their 2006 World Series run, Albert Pujols couldn't bring himself to do well against former teammate Jeff Suppan during the Cardinals-Brewers game last Saturday. "Seeing his face really choked me up, man," said Pujols following an 0-for-4 performance, which consisted of letting 12 strikes go past him without taking a single swing. "His locker used to be right over there, and he would change into his uniform there, too. I hugged him real hard when we won [the World Series]." Despite Pujols' obvious emotional connection to Suppan, the right-handed pitcher said he doesn't remember Pujols saying one word to him last season.
