Following a lawsuit from a woman alleging she was raped by a man she met on  Match.com who had previously been convicted of sexual battery, the dating website announced it would begin vetting its members to exclude known sex offenders. What do think? "I'm glad they didn't have that policy two years ago, or I never would've met Dave."

Dean Warren * Systems Analyst "Being barred from the site seems too punitive. They should just have to send a short message to each Match.com user as soon as they join, notifying everyone of their sex offender status." Darren Blanck * Unemployed
