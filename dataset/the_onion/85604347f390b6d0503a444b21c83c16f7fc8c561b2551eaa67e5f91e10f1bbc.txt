BALTIMORE--In an attempt to energize starting tackle Michael Oher for last Sunday's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh screened a copy of the inspirational sports movie , a film about the life of Ravens tackle Michael Oher. "If this big dumb guy in the movie can do it, then you can do it, too," Harbaugh said to rookie lineman Michael Oher while point to an on-screen image of rookie lineman Michael Oher. "This man didn't choose his lot in life. But his problems were at least as big as yours, and he put in the hard work and dedication it took to get picked in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens. Doesn't that inspire you?" When asked about being forced to watch the story of his own life, Oher said he didn't remember his formative years being so emotionally overwrought and rife with cliches.
