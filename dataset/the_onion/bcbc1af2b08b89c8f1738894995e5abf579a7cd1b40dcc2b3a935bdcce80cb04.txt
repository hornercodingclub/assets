NEW YORK--In a stunning development after the league's decision to grant a 5-year extension to the commissioner, the NFL revoked Roger Goodell's new contract Thursday after he failed his physical. "Unfortunately, the $200 million deal we were prepared to offer Roger was conditional upon his ability to complete our fitness exam," said spokesman Joe Lockhart, explaining that Goodell's contract was terminated after the medical evaluation revealed several issues that might impair the 59-year-old's capacity to discipline individuals, fine players, or strip draft picks from teams for misconduct. "Frankly, we were left with no choice after Mr. Goodell arrived to the exam 38 pounds overweight and failed to disclose a number of health issues to us. We're sad to see Roger go and wish the best to him and his family." Lockhart added that he hopes Goodell finds the help he needs after disclosing that the physical revealed the commissioner had been running the league with an undisclosed concussion.
