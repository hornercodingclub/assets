For years now, I have fancied myself a bit of an amateur dramatist, and you may recall that about a year ago, I wrote a play entitled . I have now written another play, a three-act drama called . Enjoy!  C. ERMINE ZWEEBOL, wealthy news-paper publisher of  QUICK-SILVER, King of the Elves. SPRY, an elf. D. TOLLIVER RUMMIDGE, editor of and Zweebol's hated rival.  ZWEEBOL: This is awful! I just received word that City Hall is on fire, but it's an hour till dead-line, and all my reporters are at home with the typhus! I would cover the fire myself, but I fear it is too late, and will scoop us!  RUMMIDGE: Ah, Zweebol, old boy! As you can see, I bear a ledger-tablet filled with details of the great fire, which I will shortly have type-set in my very own news-paper. Sorry for your bad spot of luck, old boy, but that's the way the cake, or should I say , crumbles!  ZWEEBOL: I am ruined! Ah, me!   QUICK-SILVER: Poor C. Ermine Zweebol! We must help him in his time of need. Spry, gather up the other little elves and get to work. SPRY: Yes, your majesty!   ZWEEBOL: Ah, what's this? Radish "Exclusive! City Hall burns to the ground." But who are you? And how- QUICK-SILVER: It was simple. We little elves found and killed D. Tolliver Rummidge, stole his notes, and used them for your own front page! ZWEEBOL: Dear little friends, you have saved me from ruin! For your troubles, I shall give you each a cup of rain-water and little hats fashioned from flower-petals! ELVES : Huzzah for C. Ermine Zweebol, friend of the elves!
