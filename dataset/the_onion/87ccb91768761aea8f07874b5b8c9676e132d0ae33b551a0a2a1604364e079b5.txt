FLAGSTAFF, AZ--Reports out of Arizona Cardinals training camp confirmed that for the third time this preseason--and the 33rd time since he retired in 2010--former starting quarterback Kurt Warner dropped by practice to see his former teammates and make sure they were still using appropriate, clean language. "Right after Kurt retired we weren't that surprised to see him, because he used to mention all the time how worried he was that our language would go to heck once he left," Cardinals running back Beanie Wells said Tuesday, adding that everyone on the team has noticed how badly Warner grimaces every time he hears an "F-word." "Now we're starting to get a little tired of hearing that just because a word may not offend our teammates doesn't mean it doesn't offend Jesus." Several Arizona players did, however, make a point of saying that the former MVP's periodic visits were much prefered to those of former Cardinal quarterback Jake Plummer, who stops by twice a week seemingly for no other reason than to drink as much free Gatorade as possible.
