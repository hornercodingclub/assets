NEW YORK--Shocking the literary world once again, acclaimed author Harper Lee announced through her publisher Tuesday the surprise release of her third novel, . "On behalf of Ms. Lee, we're delighted to bring the public this moving new story, which follows the heartwarming relationship between a deaf and nearly blind author in the small-town South and the extremely kind and attentive caretaker to whom she wills every penny of her $45 million estate," said HarperCollins president Michael Morrison, adding that the 185-page tale vividly brings to life the setting of a present-day assisted living facility in Monroeville, AL, where an 89-year-old protagonist named Harper comes to the life-changing decision to hand over all the money in her bank account, her property, and all future proceeds from the books she has published to her extremely upstanding and unselfish friend and lawyer, Tonja. "This is a triumphant and uplifting tale of dedicated, exemplary caregiving and the substantial monetary bequest it inspires, told by one of America's greatest living writers. Readers will be deeply touched by the heroine's stirring reflections on human warmth and her repeated assertions that she is mentally competent and fit to make her own legal decisions." Morrison added that, without spoiling too much, he could reveal that the book's final pages feature a fully notarized last will and testament signed by the author herself.
