KENOSHA, WI--After participating in the fundraising event for a local charity this past weekend, area woman Ashley Hyland reported to friends and family Monday that she had no idea competing in a 5K walk could be so unrewarding. "This was my first time doing a race like this, so I was completely unprepared for what an insignificant life experience it turned out to be," said Hyland, adding that she was blindsided by the underwhelming emotions and utter lack of accomplishment she felt as she crossed the finish line of the 5,000-meter race. "It didn't really hit me until I was out there doing it when I thought to myself, 'Wow, this is not in any way giving me a sense of purpose or changing my perspective on life.' I was really taken aback by how little it all meant. And the thing is, it wasn't just unrewarding for me--it was unrewarding for so many other people given that I raised just a total of $35 for diabetes research." Hyland added that the experience of completing a few slow laps around the public park with 2,000 or 3,000 other participants was something she would neglect to remember for the rest of her life.
