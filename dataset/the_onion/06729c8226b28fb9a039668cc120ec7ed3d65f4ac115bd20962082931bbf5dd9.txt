MIAMI--After receiving 120 of 121 first-place votes from NBA media members, Miami Heat star LeBron James admitted to reporters Thursday that he can't enjoy his fourth league Most Valuable Player award with the knowledge that writer Gary Washburn didn't cast his ballot for him. "Sure, it's nice to be in the same company as other four-time MVP winners Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Michael Jordan, but knowing Gary Washburn didn't think I deserved this makes it just seem worthless," said James, stressing that Washburn, who voted for New York Knicks small forward Carmelo Anthony, is the only journalist whose opinion truly matters within NBA circles. "Yeah, I led my team to a league-best 66-16 record, a 27-game win streak, and averaged over 26 points and 7 assists per game, but honestly, who cares? We all know Gary's vote is what counts, so I just can't help but think Carmelo deserves this honor more than I do." In light of Washburn's vote, Heat president Pat Riley is reportedly strongly considering trading James after this season.
