TEMPE, AZ--Norm Roosevelt, 52, who has worked full-time as a Radisson hotel manager while watching football games, recordings of football games, and NFL Films highlight tapes since 1980, announced Tuesday that he will retire in early March. "It's been a good run, that's for sure," said Roosevelt, who had waited until he finished watching this years' Super Bowl from behind his hotel's front desk to make the decision. "But I think it's time I hang it up and spend some time watching my son watch football before it's too late." News of Roosevelt's retirement was received graciously by the West Side Tempe Radisson team front-office personnel, who joked with Roosevelt about all the reprimands in his file for watching televised sports on company time.
