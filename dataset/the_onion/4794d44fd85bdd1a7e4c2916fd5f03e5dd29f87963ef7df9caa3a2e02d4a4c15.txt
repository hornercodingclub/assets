While 23,000 feet up Mt. Everest, three European climbers claimed they were physically attacked by 100 Sherpa guides after they disobeyed the Sherpas' commands and knocked ice onto one of the Sherpas below, though both sides later made peace. What do think? "Let's see them try that shit at sea level!" Martin Sandalis * Advertising Manager "Snow madness! I've seen this before." Felipe Trejo * Mountaineer "That's the great thing about Sherpas: You can fight with 100 of them but still make up and go climb Everest later like nothing happened." Carol Telford * Locomotive Inspector
