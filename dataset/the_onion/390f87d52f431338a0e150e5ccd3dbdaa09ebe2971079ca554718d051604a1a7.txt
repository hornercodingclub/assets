City officials in Reading, PA agreed to replace a 50-foot-tall Christmas tree downtown that residents complained was "pathetic" and "ugly" before the city council president changed his mind and ordered construction workers in the process of taking the tree down to leave it standing. What do think? "I'm sure by now all the good 50-foot-tall trees were taken." Doug Hansen * Line Cook "I hope the lumberjack who cut down that tree isn't taking this too hard. The guys who take criticism too personally are the ones who burn out of the lumberjacking biz the quickest." Josh Beaudet * Unemployed "Did they try turning the tree around so the ugly side faces the wall?" Mary Hinson * Typeface Setter
