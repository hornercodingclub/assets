The 2000 presidential election is barely in the books, but talk has already turned to the possibility of Hillary Clinton making a White House run in 2004. What do think? "A woman president? What if she menstruates all over some important legislation?" Rich Durban * Machinist "Hillary would make a great president. But she'd probably ask her girlfriends for advice, and I just don't trust that Sharon." Annette Petersen * Homemaker "She's got a good shot, so long as no one blows her up, causing her faceplate to fall off and revealing the gears and diodes beneath." Todd Tyler * Systems Analyst "Would she have female Secret Service agents? Because that'd be pretty sexy." Bob Houdel * Cashier "No, no-you don't understand: The 19th Amendment gives women the right to for a president, that's all." Bob Van Eeghen * Lawyer "We could do worse. You know, like we always have." Lisa Rinaldi * Physical Therapist
