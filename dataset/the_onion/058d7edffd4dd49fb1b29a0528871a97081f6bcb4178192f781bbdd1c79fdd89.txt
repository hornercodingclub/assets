Beef Products Inc. is suing ABC over news reports where the network used the term "pink slime" to refer to BPI's lean finely textured beef product. What do think? "This is sure to be a watershed case for slime law." Tyler Crawford * Tractor Insurer "Maybe they could reach a compromise where ABC runs messages saying beef is great and the beef people compensate them somehow." Emily Modell * Tombstone Inscriber "If defaming beef is illegal, Taco Bell better lawyer up." Brian Penfield * Coin Flattener
