President Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Oprah Winfrey will be among those delivering speeches on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial today in honor of the 50-year anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic "I Have a Dream" speech.

Bart Knaus * Systems Analyst "The speech was so incredible, it deserves to be digitally recreated in hundreds of commercials." Simon St. Pierre * Carburetor Mechanic "It's amazing how far we've come, time-wise." Ellen Cheshire * Touch-Up Painter
