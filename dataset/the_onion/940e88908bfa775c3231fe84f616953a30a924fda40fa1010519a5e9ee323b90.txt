NEW ORLEANS--Following his arrest Saturday after he unknowingly implicated himself in the 2000 slaying of his friend Susan Berman during the taping of the television documentary , real estate heir Robert Durst reportedly muttered his intention to murder his interviewers from the HBO special while unaware he was still wearing the live microphone they had placed on him three years ago. "The second I'm out, I'll shoot those moviemaking pricks that put me in here, and then I'll saw apart their bodies and hide them," Durst said while in his holding cell, apparently still oblivious to the lavalier mic that has been clipped to his shirt since the April 2012 interview and which has recorded numerous incriminating statements he has made since, including the phrases "Of course, they'll never find where I buried Kathie" and "Maybe I'll murder my brother sometime soon, too." "I'm going to kill the producers. I'm going to kill the crew. All of them are dead just as soon as this jury finds me innocent, of course." At press time, representatives for the New York scion said he was refusing press interviews for privacy reasons.
