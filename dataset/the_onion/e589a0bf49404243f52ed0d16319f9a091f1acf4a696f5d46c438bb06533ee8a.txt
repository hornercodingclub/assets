MIAMI--Following their 99-76 Game 7 loss in the Eastern Conference Finals, Indiana Pacers players confirmed Tuesday that they felt like complete idiots for believing in themselves and foolishly thinking that they ever had a chance against the Miami Heat. "It's downright embarrassing that every player on this team was actually convinced we were good enough to beat a team loaded with NBA superstars," said Pacers small forward Paul George, who apologized for getting pumped up by a speech from Indiana head coach Frank Vogel. "What the hell were we thinking? They have LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, and we have David West and George Hill. Nobody on this team has ever averaged more than 20 points a game. When I think about how confident we were during games, I can't believe we acted so stupid. Deep down we should have believed with all our heart that we would fail." At press time, George acknowledged that Indiana fans must have been "fucking delusional" to seriously believe in the Pacers.
