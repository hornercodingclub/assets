BUDAPEST, HUNGARY--Saying they never dreamed they'd have the opportunity to do so much traveling and sightseeing, tens of thousands of refugees across Europe confirmed Tuesday that they were grateful for the chance to take in so many of the continent's natural and historical treasures while being bounced from country to country. "I thought the Serbian countryside was so beautiful when we were marching through it, but, wow, Budapest is truly breathtaking--it's a real architectural gem--and hopefully once our papers expire in 48 hours we'll be off to somewhere new!" said Syrian refugee Majd Ahsan, who added that his European trip got off to a great start on the island of Lesbos in Greece, where he said he was really able to soak in the Mediterranean landscape by spending his every waking and sleeping moment outdoors. "We actually got to spend a couple extra days in Athens while the Macedonian borders were closed, which was a real treat--there's just so much rich history right there! At this point, who knows which country we'll see tomorrow or the next day. Germany? France? Ooh, maybe we'll go to Prague, get turned away at a processing center, and be sent to Poland! I hear it's really lovely." Ahsan added that he was just sad that two of his four children and both of his brothers were no longer around to enjoy the tour of Europe with him.
