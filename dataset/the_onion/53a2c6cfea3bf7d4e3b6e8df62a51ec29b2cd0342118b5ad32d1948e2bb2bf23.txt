INDIANAPOLIS--With 22 seconds remaining in the first half of Friday's Louisville-Oregon Sweet 16 matchup, CBS color commentator Clark Kellogg has reportedly mentioned the three-second differential between the shot clock and game clock approximately 86 times during a full timeout called by the Cardinals. "I just want to remind the audience at home that the shot clock and game clock are off by about three seconds," said Kellogg for the 42nd time during the timeout, moments before observing that the shot clock and game clock were off by about three seconds. "The Cardinals have to be thinking about how the shot clock and game clock are off by about three seconds. The fact that the shot clock and game clock are off by about three seconds has to be on the minds of the Ducks, too." At press time, Louisville guard Peyton Siva had just received the inbound pass as Kellogg began re-emphasizing the implications of the shot clock and the game clock being off by about three seconds.
