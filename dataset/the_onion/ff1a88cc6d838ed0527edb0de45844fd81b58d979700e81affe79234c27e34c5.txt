ATLANTA--Shaquille O'Neal dedicated an entire five-minute segment of Wednesday to an in-depth analysis of the size of his own hands, observing on several occasions that the fingers seemed to be growing right before his eyes. "Just look at these huge things--I'm pretty sure they're bigger than they were a couple seconds ago," said O'Neal, who carefully surveyed the hands by holding them several inches from his face. "I could pick up a basketball with a thumb and index finger. Wait a second. These aren't my hands. Somebody switched my normal hands with these gigantic ones when I was getting ready for the show." After the segment, O'Neal reportedly asked TNT producers for an ax, several rolls of masking tape, and his regular hands.
