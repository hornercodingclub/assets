PHILADELPHIA--Following his purchase of a pair of regular-fit Levi's blue jeans, 32-year-old Frank Auttenberg has reportedly become part of the ultra-hip, ultra-exclusive subculture of pants-wearing Americans known as Jeans Wearers, sources confirmed Wednesday. "Just a few weeks ago I was a nobody, but look at me now--a member of the jeans-wearing underground, an elite and rare group of decision makers and persons of influence," said Auttenberg, whose blue jeans get him tables at the coolest restaurants and cause people to ask, "Who is that man?" "Where is he going?" and "How do I become him?" "Innovators. Inventors. Tastemakers. Now that I wear jeans, these are the only sorts of people I socialize with. It's the kind of realm only the hippest of the hip get to enter, but here I am, ready to make my dent." Auttenberg then noticed another man wearing jeans nearby, grinned, and gave him a brief, knowing nod.
