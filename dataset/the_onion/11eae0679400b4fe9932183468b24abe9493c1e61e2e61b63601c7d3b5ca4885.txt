WASHINGTON--Needing a pick-me-up to shake his glum mood, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly scrolled through some statistics about minority incarceration rates Thursday to cheer himself up. "African-Americans: 13 percent of overall population, 40 percent of population in jails or state or federal prisons," said Sessions, the tension slowly draining from his neck and shoulders as he read that about 75 percent of drug offenders in federal prison were either Hispanic or black. "African-Americans are approximately five times more likely to be incarcerated than whites. Hispanics are twice as likely to be incarcerated as whites--only twice? We can do better than that, but I'm not going to get all stressed out again." At press time, Sessions was reportedly feeling so refreshed, he decided to save the statistics on police shootings of minorities for another time.
