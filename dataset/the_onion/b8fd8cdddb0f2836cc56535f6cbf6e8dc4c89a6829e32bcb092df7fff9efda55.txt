GREENVILLE, SC--Providing the drug's dosage information and instructions for use, the label for anti-anxiety medication Ativan reportedly recommends that patients just keep taking more and more of the pharmaceutical until something kicks in, sources confirmed Wednesday. "Take two tablets by mouth and then just keep on throwing them back until you can really feel something," reads the label adhered to the pill bottle, which further suggests that users might as well dump out as many 2 mg caplets as can fit into their palm and "pop 'em all in there" if nothing really hits them after the first dose. "Repeat every four hours, two hours, or however often you think you need a pick-me-up. Contact your doctor immediately if you go through the entire bottle and still don't feel any different." For faster-acting results, an additional sticker on the bottle reportedly urges patients to combine the medication with as many other prescription drugs as they can find.
