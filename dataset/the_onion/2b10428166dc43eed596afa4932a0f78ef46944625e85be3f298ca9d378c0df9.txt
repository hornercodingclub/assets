ATLANTA--Noting that things get "really messed up if you cross Earth's middle," Shaquille O'Neal reportedly wondered Tuesday when people in the Southern Hemisphere have March Madness. "I don't think Australia or Tokyo have March Madness for another few months, because right now it's October down there," said O'Neal, adding that the regular season would likely continue until the end of November, which he claimed comes immediately before March in the "under parts." "It's probably pretty weird playing basketball down in the bottom places like Antarctica. The ball spins in the opposite direction, and I heard the possession arrow is flipped, too. It's all backwards and stuff. Plus, after dunks you have to hang onto the rim so you don't float away." O'Neal then cautioned that players in other regions of the world must factor in the time zone difference when watching the shot clock.
