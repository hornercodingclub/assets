OLD TAPPAN, NJ--As friends and family members argued over the quality of a Pepsi Super Bowl ad that juxtaposed images of Bob Dylan and will.i.am in order to link the last several generations into one unified and Pepsi-inspired youth movement, area father Steven Acker suggested the ad was effective because it got everyone in the room talking about it. "That's what they want you to do," said Acker, nodding gently. "They don't care if you like it or not, as long as it gets in your head. Then they take their million dollars and laugh all the way to the bank." When asked about the Pepsi commercial featuring character MacGruber, Acker said he "didn't get that one."
