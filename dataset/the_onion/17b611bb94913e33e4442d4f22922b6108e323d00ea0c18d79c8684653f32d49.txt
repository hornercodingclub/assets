CINCINNATI--Basking in the sudden attention of strangers who have slowed in their tracks to look at him, smiled in his direction, and occasionally approached him at a local street festival Monday, local man Kurt Duddridge has reportedly never been more magnetic in his entire life, a fact owing to his possession of a giant turkey leg. "Hey, that looks awesome," said Allen Hayes, one of dozens of captivated passersby, who according to sources was so intrigued by Duddridge and his magnificent snack that he felt compelled to ask about it. "Where'd you get that?" At press time, Duddridge had reportedly finished his turkey leg, tossed away the bone, and reverted to his usual faceless self.
