CUPERTINO, CA--During a highly anticipated media event held today at the Apple corporation's world headquarters, CEO Tim Cook announced the new iPhone 4S is good and people should buy it. "It's a good phone," said Cook, walking out onto a stage and gesturing at a picture of the device projected on a large screen behind him. "It's got e-mail, the Internet, and you can get apps on it. Everybody should get one. It's good." After standing in place for another four seconds without speaking, Cook walked off stage, at which point the houselights came up and all in attendance were asked to please file out of the auditorium.
