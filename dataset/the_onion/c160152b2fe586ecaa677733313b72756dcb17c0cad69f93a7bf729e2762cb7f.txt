NEW YORK--In a recent interview aired on , serial child molester Jerry Sandusky came across as a likable and really quite charming individual, sources told reporters Tuesday. "Boy, I gotta say, I found myself liking him a lot in that interview," local man Scott Russell said of the former Penn State football coach and incarcerated rapist who last year was convicted of engaging in forced sodomy and oral sex with at least 10 underage boys. "He flashed that big ol' smile, and talked in this warm, soft-spoken voice, and you could tell he's got this really infectious, fun-loving personality. He was like a big kid! I don't know, I just liked the way he carried himself." Sources went on to confirm that "the guy's just got a nice vibe about him."
