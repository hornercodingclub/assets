CHESTER, PA--Saying that it was the next logical step for the company, the owners of local laundromat Sudz Cleaners told reporters Tuesday that they had recently hired social media coordinator Dan Elmets, 26, to lead the development and execution of social strategy for the coin-wash laundry business. "Dan's role is essential to Sudz Cleaners because he not only manages our Facebook and Twitter identities, he also keeps us on top of the latest trending topics and makes us a part of the global online conversation," said Bill Dunn, co-owner of the self-service and drop-off laundromat. "For example, if something happens with Clorox, we can tweet at them from our account and then repromote on Facebook. And if we get a machine fixed, we can tease it on Instagram with a photo and the caption, 'Want to wash your clothes? Dryer 5 is open!' We always try to go with those 'gotcha' moments, and that's where Dan really brings his talent and innovation to the table." Dunn added that though they are currently allocating $50,000 for just one social media position, they hope to offset the cost by raising the price of laundry detergent tablets in the vending machine by $0.20.
