SALEM, OR--After going down a slide in Riverfront Park 13 consecutive times this afternoon, Bradley Hall, 6, told sources that he would probably go down the same slide about 35 more times and then call it a day. "I see myself sliding down 30, 35 more times; maybe do a few on my stomach headfirst, a few backwards, see where it takes me," explained Hall before climbing up the slide's ladder, sitting down at the top, and going down the slide. "I'll play it by ear, you know? I might stop halfway down with my legs and try to run back up. Nothing's set in stone." As of press time, Hall had decided to take a quick break after his 28th trip down the slide in order to spin in circles and screech.
