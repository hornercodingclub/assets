RIVERSIDE, CA--Saying that if he keeps searching then the right one is bound to come along sooner or later, 28-year-old local man Carter Ecklund told reporters Tuesday he is confident the perfect dating app is waiting for him somewhere. "I know it might sound naive, but I really do believe there's an online dating service out there that was meant for me," said Ecklund, adding that he remains undiscouraged by the fact that, while many of his friends have already found websites or downloadable apps that seem to make them happy, he himself has struggled to find an internet matchmaking program he feels truly compatible with. "I've been with a lot of great sites in the past--one of my subscriptions even lasted more than a year--but for one reason or another they just never seemed to work out. My friends are always telling me there are plenty of dating services out there that would be lucky to have me. It gets frustrating, but I know I just need to keep looking." At press time, an excited Ecklund informed reporters that he was recently introduced to an online dating site that he could really see himself spending the rest of his life with.
