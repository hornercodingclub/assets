MANSFIELD, OH--Having proposed that they spend a night out together, the boyfriend of local woman Cassandra Stephenson is said to have planned a magical evening for the two of them down to the very first detail, sources reported Tuesday. "We should do something on Friday," said boyfriend Bryan Vogel, specifying the day of the week on which they will go out, the sole confirmed aspect of their romantic evening that has actually been planned in advance. "It should be fun." Sources noted that Vogel's gesture is his most considerate since Stephenson's birthday last year, when he treated her to a night on the cheapest part of town.
