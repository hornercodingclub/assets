WASHINGTON--Following the latest security breach at the White House over the weekend, President Obama told reporters Monday that he is taking extra safety precautions by now sleeping with a Louisville Slugger under his bed. "We live in a dangerous world, and it's important to be prepared to protect your family," said the president, referring to the 32-ounce wooden baseball bat he recently retrieved from the White House basement. "If I hear anybody trying to break in, it's a relief to know that I can just reach under the bed and give them a reason to think twice about ever coming back into my house. I know Michelle sleeps a lot more easily now that I've got this piece of lumber by my side." While Obama said he hopes to never use the weapon, he admitted he received a scare Sunday night when he tiptoed downstairs after hearing a noise in the Red Room and nearly took a swing at Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.
