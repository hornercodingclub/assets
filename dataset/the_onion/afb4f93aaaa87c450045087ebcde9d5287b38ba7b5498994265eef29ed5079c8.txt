NASHUA, NH--Raising his arm into the air while leaning outward from the table in a bid to command attention from the other side of the restaurant, area father Walter Bierko called over a busboy at DiCapri's Italian Eatery to inform him that he was ready to order, sources reported Wednesday. "Excuse me. Excuse me," said the father of three to the 19-year-old who was en route back to the kitchen with a full tub of dirty dishes, and who responded to the customer by indicating that he would notify their assigned waiter. "Yeah, yeah. We're ready to order now. Thanks." At press time, Bierko was reportedly gesturing toward the busboy to ask for the check.
