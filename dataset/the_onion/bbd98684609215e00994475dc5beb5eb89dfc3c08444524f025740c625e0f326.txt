CLEVELAND--Local dad Kevin Marshall, 29, began to voice concerns Monday that his 3-year-old son Bryant might be a real ding-dong, household sources confirmed. "I don't know about that kid. Starting to look like there's not much going on upstairs," said Marshall of the 3-year-old whom he called a turkey, a dingus, and a real dud. "Sometimes I just want to say, 'Hello! Knock, knock, you dope. Anyone home?' I think we may have a real on our hands." Marshall confirmed that his son is "a real sweet kid, though."
