More than 60 students from Teaneck High School in New Jersey were arrested this week after they taped hot dogs to lockers and urinated all over the floors as part of a senior class prank. What do think? "Urine all over the floors. Classic." Mark Winslow * Systems Analyst "Nice! Way to stick it to the janitorial staff." Gwen Holt * Sofa Upholstery Specialist "By failing to uphold the values of Teaneck High School, the only people those teens were really pranking were themselves." Peter Sheehan * Office Assistant
