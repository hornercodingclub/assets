TAMPA, FL--New Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano explained to reporters Friday his decision to leave Rutgers, saying the mid-Florida football team offered his family the privacy and anonymity he missed during his years in the Rutgers spotlight. "I realize many people can't understand why I would leave that big-time media market to come down here, but I want to step back and live a normal life again," said Schiano, under whose leadership Rutgers went 28-48 in the Big East and was even ranked in the top 25 one year. "Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the pressures of coaching in the 2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl, but it will be nice to work in a place where I won't have those high expectations on me all the time." Schiano led Rutgers to six bowls in 11 seasons, whereas the Buccaneers have made it to only one bowl game in their entire history.
