CLEVELAND--Saying that he has lately grown even more distant and secretive than usual, local woman Joyce Reynolds, 46, confided to reporters Monday that she has started to suspect her husband may be carrying on a second extramarital affair. "I can hear him whispering on the phone in the living room, and when I pick up the phone in the kitchen I can't recognize the voice on the other end," Reynolds said of her husband, 48-year-old Dan Reynolds, adding that she found a brand-new wristwatch in his desk drawer last week that was "way too gaudy" to be a gift from [mistress] Jessica [Schwartz]. "Lately he's been saying he has to work late on Wednesdays, and he used to only tell me that on Thursdays, when he sees Jessica. Then last week when I was doing laundry, I went through his pockets and discovered he's been carrying a third cell phone." Reynolds also noted that the last time she tailed Schwartz's car to see where she was going, Schwartz appeared to be tailing another woman's car herself.
