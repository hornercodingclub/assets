MIDLAND CITY, AL--Hours after an FBI raid freed him from the underground bunker where he had been held hostage for six days, 5-year-old Alabama boy Ethan told reporters that he already misses his fun, super-cool Bunker Grandpa. "Bunker Grandpa let me stay up all night and do whatever I want!" Ethan said Monday night, adding that he couldn't wait to tell all his friends at school about getting to spend a week playing in an "awesome underground playhouse with [his] new best friend." "He said I never had to go to school again, and as long as I was real quiet, he let me eat Skittles for dinner every night! I love Bunker Pop-Pop." Ethan stated that the best part of the experience was when the 65-year-old kidnapper let him see a real gun "way up close."
