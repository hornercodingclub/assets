LACONIA, NH--Deciding that enough time had passed since sending her previous unanswered query, local woman Enid Calhoun reportedly sat down at her computer Thursday under the impression that a third desperate, unsolicited email to a tenuous business contact should do the trick. "Hi, just following up again," wrote Calhoun, 28, adding that she hoped she wasn't being "too pushy" in her third attempt in two weeks to get a response from the hiring manager she had spoken with once, in passing, in her entire life. "I realize how busy you are, so if it's easier, maybe we can sit down over coffee near your office. You can reach me by phone, text, or email at any time (repasting again below in case you lost them). Hope to hear from you soon! Thanks so much!" At press time, Calhoun had convinced herself that the manager was on vacation and planned to send him a fourth email in another week in the unlikely event he didn't get back to her first.
