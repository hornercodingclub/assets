JACKSON HOLE, WY--A team of doctors responsible for the care of Dick Cheney revealed Thursday that for the past few years, the former vice president has burned through a minimum of three hearts every week. "Within a time span of 48 hours or so, Mr. Cheney generally exhausts his heart until it is totally unusable, at which point he comes in for a fresh heart transplant to get him through the next few days," said cardiac surgeon Dr. Anthony Griener, noting that when a spent heart is pulled from Cheney's thoracic cavity, it generally emerges smoldering, shriveled, and completely black, at times also secreting a corrosive, viscous brown liquid. "He's had so many transplants at this point that we no longer even have to apply general anesthesia or make a new incision for the procedure. He comes in, we chat with him for a bit while we pry open his chest, and we insert a fresh heart. Then he's on his way." Doctors also revealed that Cheney is thriving under these conditions and will likely continue to live for many, many, many years to come.
