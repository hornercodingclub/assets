A teahouse called KitTea is seeking to open in San Francisco and provide a place for patrons to sip tea and mingle with approximately 10 cats, which will be selected for their temperament from a local rescue service. What do think? "The cats I want to hang out with wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this." Ann Milliner * Fitness Center Receptionist "Ever since my cat died, I have been looking to get back out there and mingle." Jackson Grant * Trolley Operator "That's fantastic! I usually have to sprinkle my tea with cat hair I brought from home." Robert Gostigian * Family Physician
