JACKSONVILLE, FL--Jets quarterback Tim Tebow reportedly sat alone during Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, arranging empty Gatorade cups in the wildcat formation and running plays across the bench. "I walked over there and he was muttering something to one of the cups about it having 'unique skills' that would make the wildcat a powerful offensive weapon," said Jets defensive lineman Mike DeVito, adding that there was also a Tebow-voiced analyst cup that said cups in the wildcat provided the only chance to win the game. "At one point he had all those cups join together in a circle, and he closed his eyes like he was praying with them." With the game on the line in the closing minutes of the fourth quarter, Jets coach Rex Ryan turned to Tebow to ask for the cups back, as team members who were playing in the game were reportedly thirsty.
