DALLAS-- Though ESPN intended to broadcast Drew Bledsoe's entire retirement speech last Wednesday, the sports network cut away from the veteran quarterback's press conference in order to air commercials for electronics retail giant Circuit City, Sprint, and the new Honda Accord. "I have learned a lot in my 14 years in this great league, but the one thing that always stuck with me, no matter how difficult it got out there, was..." said Bledsoe before the network aired the two-minute block of advertisements, after which they cut back to Bledsoe's concluding statement. "...Only wish I could have played a lot better. Thanks." ESPN then interrupted the proceeding question-and-answer session with more commercials from Chrysler, Zip-Car, and, for viewers in the Pittsburgh area, a local commercial for attorney Edgar Snyder.
