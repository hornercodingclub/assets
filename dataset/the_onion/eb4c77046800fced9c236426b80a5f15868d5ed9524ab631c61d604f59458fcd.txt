All but assured the Republican presidential nomination, John McCain has begun discussing possible running mates. Who is on his short list? : Petulant-terrier look always plays well at foreign state funerals. : Just such a huge, huge fan. : As nobody has done nothing for McCain, McCain likewise intends to do nothing for nobody. : To attract hip, young blogger voters. : McCain hates him with the burning hatred of a thousand exploding suns, which is always a good aspect of any president/VP relationship. : Doesn't really think he's qualified, but would you look at that face? How can you say no to that face? : Just because it would be amazing to see the look on everyone's faces when they say "No way!" followed by "Well, it kind of makes sense." : Bass player needed.
