SAN DIEGO--Befuddled San Diego Padres lead owner Jeff Moorad explained Monday that he was under the assumption that every team failing to make the playoffs ripped apart its stadium and rebuilt a new one for next year. "Wait, isn't that the rule?" Moorad, flanked by the entire Padres roster, told reporters just after detonating the 20,000 sticks of dynamite required to reduce 6-year-old Petco Park to rubble. "You're kidding me-- We're the only team who blew up our stadium? What about Baltimore? No? Shit." Despite the powerful explosion that destroyed everything within a 3,500-foot radius of the blast, Tony Gwynn's commemorative statue just outside the ballpark remained completely intact.
