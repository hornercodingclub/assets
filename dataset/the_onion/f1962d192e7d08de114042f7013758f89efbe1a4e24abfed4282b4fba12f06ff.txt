BOCA RATON, FL--Excited ninetysomethings across the country announced Wednesday they were gearing up to take full advantage of what promises to be the final year of their lives. "I feel totally reinvigorated--this year I'm grabbing the bull by the horns and getting ready to die, first by canceling all my magazine subscriptions," said 92-year-old Hollis Ryzek, adding that his new carpe diem attitude stems from his desire to tell his grandchildren he loves them one final time. "I'm looking forward to planning my last words, getting my living will in order in case they have to pull the plug on me, and then it's off to sit alone in my room at the assisted living facility and think about how all my friends are dead. This is going to be the best last year ever!" Ryzek said he jumped feetfirst into his dynamic new routine, spending New Year's Day calling all his relatives to make sure they knew he wanted to be cremated.
