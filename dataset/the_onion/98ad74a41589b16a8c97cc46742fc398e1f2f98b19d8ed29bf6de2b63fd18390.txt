People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has awarded AMC series The Walking Dead its annual Innovation in Television Award for the show's humane decision to use CGI for their upcoming tiger character rather than filming with a live animal. What do think? "AMC is always producing PETA Award bait." Brock Singer * Remote Programmer "I don't see how putting a tiger in a motion capture suit is any more humane." Viola Griffin * Crossword Analyst "This laudable decision will surely allow PETA to find something else to complain about." Homer Jeffs * Geode Curator
