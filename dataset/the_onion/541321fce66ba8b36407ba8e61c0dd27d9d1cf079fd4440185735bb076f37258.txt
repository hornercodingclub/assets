GLENDALE, AZ--After defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday to win his fourth Super Bowl title, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick took a moment to credit the landmark victory to his god. "We've had to endure a lot to get to this point, but it just goes to show that all things are made possible through Y'golonac," Belichick told reporters as he stood on the trophy stage, emphasizing that his strong relationship with Y'golonac, the Defiler, has given him the strength to get to where he is today. "Win or lose, I'm humbled by all of the Great Old One's blessings. I'm just thankful that today the great and almighty Y'golonac gave me what it took to win. Thank you, my lord and savior." At press time, Belichick reportedly knelt down to lead the Patriots in a team prayer, after which the ground inside University of Phoenix Stadium began to tremble.
