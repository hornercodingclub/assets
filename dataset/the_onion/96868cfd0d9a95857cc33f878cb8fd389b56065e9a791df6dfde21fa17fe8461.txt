MIAMI--Whirling an empty Corona bottle above his head as he drew onlookers' attention with a loud, sustained howl, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders reportedly impressed Florida voters Monday by jumping from his hotel balcony into the pool below. "Hey, everyone, check this out!" said the shirtless two-term Vermont senator, clambering up onto the railing outside his fifth-floor hotel room and prompting a chorus of cheers by briefly dancing on the narrow ledge to the audible strains of Fetty Wap's "Trap Queen" emanating from the poolside patio before making the 50-foot leap into the water. "Bombs away!" At press time, a soaking-wet Sanders was inviting the swing state's residents to "really get this party started" by joining him for body shots of Jose Cuervo.
