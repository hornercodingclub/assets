YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, NY--ESPN baseball writer Buster Olney sat his kids down Monday evening to tell them they could always bring any questions about school, reproductive health, Alfonso Soriano's contract, or anything else on their minds to him on Twitter. "I don't care what the question is, whether it's about long division, having wet dreams, run differential, or whatever, I'm your dad and I'm going to tweet you back," said Olney, reminding his children that any prospective trade acquisition they asked about at this point in the season would have to first pass through waivers. "I do get a lot of tweets, so you guys may want to use a hashtag like #olneyfamily to make sure I see it, but the important thing to know is that I will always be there for you on social media." Olney cautioned his kids to type @Buster_ESPN with an underscore, claiming there was "some guy" with the Twitter handle @BusterESPN pretending to be him.
