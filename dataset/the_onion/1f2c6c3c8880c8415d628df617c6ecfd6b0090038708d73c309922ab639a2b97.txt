SOUTH AMERICA?--Following what must have been a successful on-field achievement Sunday, a professional, semi-professional, or possibly amateur male soccer player wearing a sky-blue shirt appeared happy, sources confirmed. According to reports, fans in attendance adorned with similarly blue-colored clothing, flags, and face paint were also happy, while players wearing red shirts hung their heads because they were sad. Along the sidelines, a group of people in yellow shirts remained neither happy nor sad but mostly seemed indifferent, and as of press time, no players on the field were wearing pink or purple shirts.
