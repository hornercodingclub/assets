CORAL GABLES, FL--Noting that he had already purchased the song for his wind-up Victrola seven decades ago, extremely hip 90-year-old Emmet McInerny insisted Monday that he had every right to download  a recording of Glenn Miller's "In The Mood" for free using a BitTorrent client. "Hell, the Miller estate's gotten enough money out of me," the tech-savvy nonagenarian stated as the download bar for the 1939 big-band staple passed 70 percent. "And I sure as hell don't feel like lining the pockets of the bigwigs at RCA. I know it's not their fault I lost my old 78 of the song when I moved houses back in 1965, but fuck it." Since he was online anyway, McInerny then proceeded to torrent "Mairzy Doats" by the Merry Macs.
