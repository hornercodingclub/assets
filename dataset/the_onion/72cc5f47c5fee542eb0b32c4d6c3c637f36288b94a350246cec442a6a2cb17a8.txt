MILPITAS, CA--Saying his casual writing style made him "stand out immediately," sources at Redding Media reported Monday that the informal tone of Michael Yanover's job application had set him apart from the candidates under serious consideration. "As soon as I read his cover letter greeting of 'Hey there,' I could tell Michael was much different from the applicants we've brought in for interviews so far," said head recruiter Anne Peabody, adding that Yanover had quickly captured her attention with the line "This job and me are meant for each other." "I didn't even have to get all the way to the end--after he called himself a 'social media maven' and a 'certified data junkie,' I fast-tracked his resume to a separate pile reserved for people we won't be getting back to." At press time, Peabody had reportedly given Yanover's application a second look, deciding it was worth forwarding around to the entire office.
