GAINESVILLE, FL--In light of recent allegations that University of Florida football player Treon Harris sexually assaulted a female student, 23-year-old Gators fan Anthony Kedzie reportedly took a brave and valiant stance Wednesday by refusing to pass any premature judgment on the freshman quarterback. "I don't think it's wise to jump to any conclusions here--we need to wait until all of the facts come out first," said the honorable and courageous Kedzie, who is determined to protect the integrity of the judicial system by not rushing to write off the accused athlete until authorities complete a full investigation of the case. "At this point, they're just allegations, so we have no way of knowing what did or didn't happen. Let's at least give him a chance to tell his side of the story. The accusations could very well turn out to be false--that does happen, you know." In a further display of his noble commitment to respecting due process, Kedzie went on to criticize the Gators' decision to suspend Harris indefinitely, noting that the young quarterback should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play this weekend against LSU.
