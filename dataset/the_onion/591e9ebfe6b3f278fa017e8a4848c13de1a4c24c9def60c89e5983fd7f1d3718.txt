Scientists at CERN trapped atoms of antihydrogen for more than 16 minutes, enabling them to study the elusive material more closely than ever. What do think? "That's great. I've always wondered what antimatter smells like." Tom Eltson * Baker "Man! The same 16 minutes I choose to step out for a sub. Just my luck!" Yvonne Butler * Scientist "Eh, that's not really my thing. I'm more into retrophysics--you know, the atom is the smallest particle, the universe is infinite, and everything is composed of matter."
