PHILADELPHIA--In an absolutely precious little press conference before the start of the NLDS Wednesday, the upstart Colorado Rockies confirmed that they would be making the most adorable effort to win the World Series this year. "They looked so handsome up there in their clean, pressed uniforms that I could have just died," said ESPN baseball analyst Peter Gammons, adding that he wanted to walk right up to Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and pinch his iddy-biddy cheeks. "I know I shouldn't have laughed when they said they thought they had a chance, but it was so priceless to see them pretending to talk like grown-ups." Saying that they felt they were being patronized, the Rockies concluded the press conference with quite the temper tantrum, because they were tired and cranky and needed a nap.
