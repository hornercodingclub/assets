NEW YORK--A 29-second video clip of Wizards rookie John Wall driving to the hoop for a layup against the Sixers has failed to achieve viral status on the Internet, NBA.com sources confirmed Wednesday. "We really thought people would send this thing around," the website's spokesperson Morgan Dunn said of the video that, at press time, had 144 views. "I don't get it. If you're a basketball fan--and there's millions of them out there--this is exactly the kind of thing you'd want to see. We even put in a little Digg thing there and made it easy to tweet." Despite the setback, NBA.com said that a new video of Lakers center Pau Gasol answering a question in a postgame interview should "blow up" immediately after it's posted this Friday.
