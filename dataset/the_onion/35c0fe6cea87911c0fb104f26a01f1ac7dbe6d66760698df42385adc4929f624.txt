Cesar Milan of the popular show Dog Whisperer has been cleared of animal cruelty charges after a recent episode featured an agitated French bulldog biting a pig on the ear and drawing blood, an incident that investigators have concluded was handled with the proper veterinary care.

Ray Boylan * Unemployed "This is why I don't let my pigs watch TV." Maura Reznick * Treatment Planner
