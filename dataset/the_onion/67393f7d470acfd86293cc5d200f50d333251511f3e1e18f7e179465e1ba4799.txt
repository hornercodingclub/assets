BEREA, OH--Wide receiver Braylon Edwards regaled his teammates Wednesday with tales of breaking the Browns voluntary-camp curfew to sneak into the girls' dormitory, where he allegedly open-mouth kissed several young women attending the optional workouts. "Oh, yeah, real mouth-open kisses," Edwards said, encouraging his teammates to attend the camp next year if they wanted to take part in the late-night make-out sessions. "I'm not saying they weren't some large girls, but you know what, I think the big ones are more passionate." While head coach Romeo Crennel said he was pleased with Edwards' enthusiasm for the discretionary mini-camp, he expressed concern about the offensive line's allegations that a mysterious figure repeatedly appeared out of nowhere and molested them in their bunks.
