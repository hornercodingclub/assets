During my years as a hard-bitten newspaper-man, I rarely had time for culture. But after a court order forced my retirement, at last I was free to indulge in artistic pursuits and to pen gripping works of drama. With that in mind, I now present to you my latest play in two acts,   MR. SWEEBUL, elderly invalid plutocrat BLANDISH, his faithful man-servant NURSE, his mechanical ro-bot nurse THE IRON LUNG, his mechanical breathing device PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON, leader of the Republic  BLANDISH: Forgive my intrusion, sir, but I have a cable here from the President of the United States. SWEEBUL: Wilson? What in the name of God does he want? BLANDISH: Nothing specific, sir, but he does mention that he will be visiting the Estate to-day to give you something special. SWEEBUL: I do hope it is a vial of Dr. Klimpt's Poultry Liniment, as my anus is as hot as Hades and burning-red besides, and it will soothe it. BLANDISH: Very good, sir.   BLANDISH: Sir, the President.  WILSON: Sweebul, old stick, how the devil are you? SWEEBUL: Get down to brass tacks, Wilson, I'm a busy man. WILSON: I myself cannot tarry, as I must capture that wretched Pancho Villa. In the meanwhile, here is a small gift to you from me, with my warmest compliments.  SWEEBUL: A vial of Dr. Klimpt's Poultry Liniment! Glory be! My anus shall be as smooth as velvet once again!
