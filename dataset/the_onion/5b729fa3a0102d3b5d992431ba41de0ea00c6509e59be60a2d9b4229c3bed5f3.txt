DENVER--While speaking to members of the media following yesterday's practice, several Broncos players reportedly took time to reflect on their perfect season ending with Sunday's humiliating 35-19 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. "I think we stopped taking games one at a time, got caught looking ahead, and ultimately we paid the price," said Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker, referring to their embarrassing 16-point win over the last-place Jaguars in which the Broncos only managed to score four touchdowns heading into the fourth quarter. "Missing out on perfection is obviously a tough pill to swallow, but at the end of the day we've got a lot of other goals we'd still like to accomplish. Coach Fox has said from the beginning that winning the Super Bowl is all that matters, so finishing strong and securing a bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs is what we're focusing on now. There's definitely plenty left for us to play for." At press time, sources confirmed Jaguars players continued to celebrate their sixth straight moral victory.
