NEW YORK--Saying that there are plenty of franchises that would "love to have her," league sources reported Wednesday that multiple NFL teams have expressed high levels of interest in your sister. "We've had our eye on her for a while, and we're confident she has a whole lot to offer this organization," said Colts GM Ryan Grigson, echoing the sentiment of 12 interested parties who "like what [they've] seen so far" from the coveted 18-year-old. "She's got just the kind of build we're looking for. What is she, by the way? A college freshman? Wow, she's really matured over the past few years. She certainly has our attention." Sources also noted that many of the involved teams were willing to offer your sister "significant compensation" in return for her services.
