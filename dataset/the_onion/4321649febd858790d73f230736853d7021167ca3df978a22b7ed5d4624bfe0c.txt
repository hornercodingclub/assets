New Jersey governor Chris Christie announced he would support Mitt Romney's candidacy for president. What do think? "It's statements like that which lead me to believe Christie's still open to a bid for the White House in 2012. Run, Christie, run!" Charles Wolff * Auto Salesperson "Why?

Does 'Romney and Christie' sound like one of the best goddamn '70s throwback duos we've seen in a while? Hell yes! I'm going to vote for them and hope they know that's why!" Monica Bert * Unemployed
