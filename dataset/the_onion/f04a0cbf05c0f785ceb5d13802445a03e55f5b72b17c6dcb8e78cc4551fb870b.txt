CLEVELAND--As part of an ongoing effort to rejuvenate its public transportation system, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority announced Wednesday that it had signed a three-year, $32 million deal hiring Academy Award-winning actress Charlize Theron to ride the city's light-rail lines eight hours a day, Monday through Friday. "Each work week, Ms. Theron will bring the glitz and glamour of a Hollywood movie premiere right to Cleveland's own RTA Rapid Transit trains," spokesperson Ted Reardon said of the agreement, which will also require the 36-year-old star to use Cleveland's public buses for 14 consecutive hours on the third Saturday of every month. "Who knows? You might just see Charlize on the Red Line, the Blue Line, or sleeping on a wooden bench in the Tower City station!" This latest initiative reportedly builds on the Cleveland water service's recent awareness program, which largely involved paying Alfred Molina to swim laps in the central reservoir.
