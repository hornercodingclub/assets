ST. LOUIS--Having earlier in the day set his Gchat status to "invisible," local man Jeff Young, 29, reportedly spent his Wednesday afternoon monitoring the comings and goings of his various online contacts as a silent and unknowable observer, espying the world and its madding crowd from his lofty, impregnable perch. "Here I lurk, unseen and yet all-seeing, privy to the deepest and darkest secrets of all who toil below me," Young said, moments after withdrawing into the virtual shadows, all evidence of his very online existence obscured by an unassuming gray circle in his Gchat sidebar. "I am a watcher of limitless vision, unknown to the watched, gazing with fearsome power and great solemnity upon those pitiable fools whose online presence lies in plain sight. Lo, in my omniscience, I am akin to God Himself." At press time, Young's girlfriend had somehow breached his seemingly impenetrable observatory, demanding to know why he was ignoring her.
