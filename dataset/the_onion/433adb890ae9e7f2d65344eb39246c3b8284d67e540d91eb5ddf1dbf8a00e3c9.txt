EUGENE, OR--Concerned that the newest chapter of the franchise would underwhelm viewers with a senseless, inane plot and shallow two-dimensional characters, moviegoer Marc Davis expressed worries Friday that sixth movie might just be stupid. "I'm a little anxious that this sixth movie is just going to a big, loud, moronic waste of time," said Davis, who shared his opinion that the trailer for the new movie made it seem like a dumbed-down version of the previous five installments. "Of course I was excited when it was first announced, but the more that comes out about it, the more it seems like unnecessary retreading of old themes and familiar characters. I'm trying to keep my hopes up, but I can't help but think they'll go for cheap thrills and flashy action sequences instead of really approaching these mechanized humanoid aliens with anything approaching nuance." Davis expressed hopes that, even if was an overblown mess, the filmmakers could make up for it by returning to form with the seventh and eighth movies, slated for release over the next few years.
