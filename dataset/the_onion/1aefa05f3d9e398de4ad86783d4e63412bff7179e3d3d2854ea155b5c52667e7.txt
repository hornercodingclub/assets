According to the British website GetWestLondon, a new plus-size clothing store outside London plans to feature fitting rooms that play audio recordings of compliments while customers try on clothes. What do think? "That's all right, I always bring some friends to give me insincere compliments whenever I go shopping." Mary Clearwater * Curriculum Designer "It's nice to know that in London, plus-size people are also considered idiots." Matt Herndon * Parking Ticket Issuer "Sorry, but no machine can make the experience of trying on clothes as awkward and uncomfortable as a real-life salesperson." Amelia Barston * Visitor Center Representative
