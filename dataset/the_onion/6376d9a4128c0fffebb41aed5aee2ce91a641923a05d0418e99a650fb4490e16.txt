NEW YORK--Announcing the record-setting deal hours before his final game as a player, the New York Yankees revealed at a press conference Friday that the team has signed Alex Rodriguez to a 10-year, $420 million contract as a front office consultant. "Alex is a truly unique talent, and that's why we've decided to heavily invest in his services as a member of our front office for the next decade," said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, noting that the new contract, which comes with a $35 million signing bonus, will take effect immediately following Rodriguez's last game for the club and will offer up to $100 million in further compensation if the 41-year-old achieves specified performance milestones. "Everyone in the organization couldn't be more excited about this, and I think all the fans in New York will be thrilled to know that A-Rod will continue as part of the Yankees organization for a long, long time." Cashman added that the terms also give Rodriguez the option to extend his front office contract in 2026 by an additional three years for $250 million.
