ORLANDO, FL--Sources within the Orlando Magic organization reported Thursday that the cover of the team's upcoming 2012-13 season preview guide would feature an aerial photograph of the Amway Center as well as the Magic logo displayed in the lower-right corner. "The options really came down to Hedo Turkoglu holding a ball in his left hand, Jameer Nelson pretending to pass the ball into the camera, or Al Harrington and Arron Afflalo standing back-to-back," said Magic director of communications George Galante, noting that a dramatic picture of the logo at half court was also considered for the cover. "Instead, we chose the Amway Arena. It's a really nice photo." In addition, the team released a statement revealing that for pregame introductions Orlando would just play heavy rock music and have the entire starting five waving from the bench upon the announcement of "your Orlando Magic!"
