MINNEAPOLIS--Fox play-by-play announcer Joe Buck claimed to be overwhelmed with feelings of inadequacy, betrayal, and grief Sunday after catching color commentator Troy Aikman covering the Packers-Vikings game with another man. "Troy? Troy! I can't believe you would do this to me after insisting I was the only broadcasting partner you ever wanted or needed," said Buck, who walked in on Aikman and play-by-play announcer Thom Brennaman intimately discussing Vikings rookie quarterback Christian Ponder's first NFL start. "The second I'm away you're hopping into the booth with...with some guy? Some guy who could never describe a 6-yard carry by running back James Starks the way I can? Does he know that you prefer it when I say the 'ball carrier burst through a huge hole'? I trusted you, Troy, but here you are sharing footage of your rookie season with some man you don't even know." Sources confirmed Aikman repeatedly apologized to Buck, saying, "It's not what it looks like," while putting on his pants.
