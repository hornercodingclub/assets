SYDNEY--Australian character actor Paul Hogan, 74, told sources in an exclusive interview Tuesday that he's "still searching" for that one career-defining role. "I'm proud of my work, but despite acting in a variety of different films, I've yet to find that one iconic, unforgettable character with whom everyone identifies me," said Hogan, who has been appearing in motion pictures for more than a quarter century. "When people hear the name Paul Hogan, there isn't any particular performance that comes to mind, but rather a broad range of many diverse roles. I just have to keep working, and hopefully something great will come along eventually." Hogan then reportedly opened up about his divorce from his wife of 23 years, an actress he met while working on a film in 1986.
