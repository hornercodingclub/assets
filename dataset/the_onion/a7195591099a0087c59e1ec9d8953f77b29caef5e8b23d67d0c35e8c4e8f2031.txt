DES MOINES, IA--Saying the state's residents had been left in the dark for far too long, Gov. Terry Branstad demanded Monday that the federal government reveal which star on the American flag belonged to Iowa. "As both proud Iowans and patriotic American citizens, we have a right to know the exact row and column of our star," said Branstad, voicing concerns that it "better not be on the bottom or way off to the side." "Are they arranged by geographical location? Or is it by when each state joined the Union? Whatever it is, I just think we should be able to look at the flag and point to where our star is. Otherwise, it seems pointless to even have them on there at all." Branstad added that the inability to identify Iowa's star was particularly egregious since it was well-known that the stars' blue background represented Guam.
