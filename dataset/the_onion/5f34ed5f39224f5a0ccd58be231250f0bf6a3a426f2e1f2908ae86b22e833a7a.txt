DENVER--Upon overhearing visitors to the Broncos training facility inquire about third-string quarterback Brady Quinn, a young but grizzled Brady Quinn was seen to lean forward, raise his eyebrows, frown thoughtfully, and cast his eyes upward in apparent reverie, sources reported Saturday. "Brady Quinn, eh? Brady Quinn. Now that's a name you don't hear very often...least not anymore," said Quinn, who leaned back against the wall, thumbed back his battered Notre Dame cap, and stroked his long, unkempt beard. "They say he was quite the hot item coming out of college. At least, the Browns thought so. Heh. The Browns... But no, this here's the Broncos, and all anyone talks about round these parts is Tim Tebow. Seems like ages since anyone even mentioned the name Brady Quinn." Quinn then leaned back in his rocking chair and went back to sleep.
