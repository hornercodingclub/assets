PHOENIX--Unwilling to cede decades of hard-won advances, local man Roger Cannon's persistent anxiety vowed Monday that it would not let clinical depression muscle in on any of its turf. "Look, I've had a vise-grip on this guy for 30 years, so I'm not about to roll over now and let some despondent feelings and an overriding aversion to activity waltz in and take over his emotional state," said the mental disorder, adding that it would "crank up" Cannon's irrational worrying, restlessness, and agitation to drive depression out of its territory once and for all. "Roger's mental condition is domain. And if all-encompassing thoughts of hopelessness and inadequacy think they can parade around like they own the place, trust me, they've got another thing coming." The neurosis then promised that it wouldn't make the same mistake it did in 2011, when it briefly let its guard down and disastrously allowed happiness to take hold.
