LOUISVILLE, KY--According to reports, local woman Janelle Tompkins' arrival to work an hour late and severely hungover Tuesday morning was precisely the 30th wake-up call she needed to turn her life around. "Wow, my habit of staying out and drinking all night has clearly gotten out of control. I've got to make some major changes ASAP," said Tompkins, using the exact phrasing she uttered during her five previous wake-up calls this year, which have included two shattered relationships and blacking out at a friend's bridal shower. "I suppose something had to give eventually, and now I've gotten the message: It's time to make a fresh start and think about my future for once." At press time, Tompkins had invited several close friends to celebrate her new lease on life by meeting at their local bar's Oktoberfest celebration.
