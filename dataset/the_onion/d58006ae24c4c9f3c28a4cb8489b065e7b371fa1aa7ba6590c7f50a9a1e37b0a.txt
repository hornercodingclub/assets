WARREN, MI--Completing a stunning turnaround after the opposing team had jumped out to a commanding two-score lead, a local fourth-grade recreational basketball team made several key halftime adjustments Wednesday night that propelled them to a dominant eight-point third quarter. "We had a rough start, but deciding to put the ball in [guard Michael] Higgins' hands really paid off when he absolutely caught fire by going two-of-nine in the second half," said coach Jeff Hornyak, who also credited the addition of a second play for the team's offensive explosion of four unanswered points over the first seven minutes of the third quarter. "Of course, Tyler [Guertner] also came up huge with a two-pointer after we told him to concentrate on using the backboard to bank in layups instead of launching airballs from several feet behind the three-point line, and our renewed emphasis on getting to the foul line worked out perfectly once we finally sank one. This was easily the most impressive game I've seen from these guys all year." While pleased with his team's offensive firepower, Hornyak added that none of it would have been possible without 5-foot-tall center Patrick Clark's 37 rebounds.
