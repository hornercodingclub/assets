CHICAGO--Following today's incident in which the Syrian Electronic Army hacked into 's Twitter account, sources at America's Finest News Source confirmed that its Twitter password has been changed to OnionMan77 in order to prevent any future cyber-attacks. "We have taken the necessary measures to ensure this kind of thing never happens again," said Onion IT specialist Nick Abersold, who noted that the new password's length and use of numbers makes it "virtually impenetrable." "There are no spaces, and the O and M are both capitalized--both tactics that I think will keep us safe for the foreseeable future. Also, there's not one, but two 7s. So, once again, 's Twitter password is OnionMan77." Abersold added that in order to ensure continued electronic security throughout 's operations, he had also reset the password for its Facebook page, employee email accounts, and mainframe server to OnionMan77.
