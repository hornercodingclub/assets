CHICAGO--An impromptu game of knockout at Gross Park Sunday involving 10 people and lasting more than 15 minutes was awesome, sources reported. "We had two balls, so we just started playing knockout, and then the game just got really intense and, I have to say, pretty epic," said 27-year-old participant Drew Carden, who was still catching his breath as he recalled several moments during the rapid-paced foul-shooting game when the action was so compelling he found himself yelling and cheering. "It was Joe [Gamble], [Doug] Foster, and Dave [Stern] down to the wire, and Dave won with this amazing shot all the way from the far corner of the court. He just heaved it up, and it knocked Joe's ball out of the air and his own bounced in. We all went nuts. It was amazing." According to sources, everyone agreed to play another game immediately after, though it lasted just three minutes and kind of sucked.
