NEW YORK--Explaining how she was originally shown the small, out-of-the-way establishment years ago by a well-connected friend, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly took her campaign staff to a little hole-in-the-wall financial institution in lower Manhattan Tuesday that she said not many people know about. "Everyone knows JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs--and for good reason; those places are great--but wait till you see what this place is like," said Clinton, telling her campaign team that she visits the modestly sized, boutique financial services firm every time she's in New York. "Best service in the entire city, believe me. I've actually gotten to know the guy who owns it pretty well. Just you watch; he always hooks me up whenever I stop by." At press time, a smiling Clinton was being greeted with loud salutations and warm embraces from the firm's longtime employees upon walking through the front door.
