KABUL, AFGHANISTAN--In his first major policy speech since being sworn in for a second term, Afghan president Hamid Karzai made a solemn pledge Wednesday to combat the rampant corruption of Afghan president Hamid Karzai. "Let me be clear: I will not rest until I bring an end to my graft and backroom deal-making," said Karzai, later adding that he will personally head up an investigation into allegations that he authorized massive voter fraud in order to secure his own victory in August's presidential election. "The blind eye that I continue to turn to drug trafficking, embezzlement, and human rights violations will no longer be tolerated, and I will do everything in my power to finally bring myself to justice." Karzai also announced the appointment of several relatives to a new commission that will tackle the problem of nepotism within his administration.
