LOWER MERION, PA--Calling the murderous character's methods and practices into question, movie viewer Richard Anthony said Tuesday that, were he in fact the killer portrayed in the home invasion film , he would have conducted himself in a distinctly different fashion. "This makes absolutely zero sense--why didn't he just murder the majority of them when they were trapped in the kitchen? If that were me, I could've gotten the job done with a gas leak and some matches right then and there," said Anthony, 33, insisting that a much more straightforward approach would have allowed him to strangle the rest of the victims at his leisure. "Plus, I wouldn't have wasted all that time tying up that family once they were already unconscious--but if that's the route you're taking, at least knot the ropes with a constricting clove hitch. It just really took me out of the story." At press time, Anthony had published a painstakingly detailed blog post deriding the film's implausibility and providing more practical alternatives for each character fatality.
