PRINCETON, NJ--Watching helplessly as his fellow partygoers moved on to a different topic of conversation, local man Greg Southerton reportedly abandoned the group Tuesday and directed the full force of his anecdote towards a single, nearby person. "Speaking of childhood pets, I had this pretty wild thing happen to my cat when I was a kid," said Southerton, desperately locking eyes with a female acquaintance as he realized the remainder of their peers had lost interest and begun talking about weekend plans, leaving him totally in the dust. "Okay, so, one day, I got home from kindergarten and I couldn't find her anywhere. My parents and I looked all around and finally we discover her at the top of this tall tree in our yard. And here's where things get really crazy--we couldn't get her down." At press time, Southerton's target had reportedly ducked out of the conversation in order to respond to a text message, leaving him to mumble the narrative's conclusion into his drink.
