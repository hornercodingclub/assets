THE ISLE OF EMBERS--With the natives' drumbeats suddenly falling silent as a mysterious midday darkness rolled across the island, sources confirmed that a solar eclipse occurred just in time Friday to stop imperiled U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry from being cooked alive by cannibals. "See what you've done? I bring the darkness! I command the sun! I am a very powerful man!" Kerry reportedly shouted after quickly assessing the situation, causing the tribe's shaman to cry out in fear and fall prostrate to the ground while several tribesmen hastily lowered the roasting spit on which they had been carrying the United States' top diplomat toward a blazing fire. "You cannot kill me, for I am a god! Release me now, and perhaps I will restore the light I have taken from you!" At press time, reports confirmed that the cannibals were reverently chanting the former Massachusetts senator's name as they bore him on a luxurious sedan chair to a feast prepared in his honor.
