KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA--Saying they have endured heart-wrenching uncertainty and deserved definitive answers, the families of passengers aboard missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 expressed hope Wednesday that the media will eventually receive some kind of closure regarding the plane's mysterious disappearance. "This has been an extremely difficult time for the reporters and anchors covering this event; they have put their lives on hold over the past 10 days and we know they won't be able to move forward until they learn the fate of this airliner," said Sarah Wan, speaking on behalf of the relatives and loved ones of the 239 missing individuals, who remain hopeful that some sort of resolution will be reached for the sake of the various news networks and websites. "The conflicting reports and numerous remaining unanswered questions have been devastating for them. It's not surprising that they are obsessing around the clock, wondering what could have possibly occurred on board that flight. I don't know how they are able to stay so resilient, grasping at every new statement or bit of information that trickles out. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them." Wan said there was still a chance the plane may have been hijacked and the passengers aboard had been taken hostage, but she didn't want to unfairly get the media's hopes up.
