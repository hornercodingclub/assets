NEW YORK--Slowing things down after a string of on-again, off-again romances, sources confirmed today that pop star is currently in a long-distance relationship with NASA's Curiosity Rover. "Taylor is really serious about Curiosity, and even though the distance is tough, she's determined to make the relationship work," Defamer.com writer Katie Jensen said of the 23-year-old country crooner and the six-wheeled automated motor vehicle, nicknaming the couple "Trover." "Taylor has visited Mars every chance she's gotten, but she's not crazy about the temperature, and would prefer it if Curiosity moved to L.A. at some point down the road. Still, she's definitely in love and she would move to the Red Planet in a heartbeat if Curiosity asked her." At press time, sources confirmed the infatuated Swift was sending private X-band radio waves to the rover's UHF antenna.
