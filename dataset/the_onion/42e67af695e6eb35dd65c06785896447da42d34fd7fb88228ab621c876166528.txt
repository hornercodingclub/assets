WASHINGTON--Alarmed by the sudden change in his thinking and behavior, White House aides said Tuesday that they were concerned about President Trump's declining mental health after he admitted he may not be an omnipotent living god. "The president has always been completely clearheaded about his status as the supreme being, so we naturally began to suspect something wasn't right when he started openly doubting that he was the creator and eternal master of existence," said Trump staffer Greg Fairfield, adding that he sincerely hoped that the president was just tired or under stress on those occasions when he second-guessed his status as an all-knowing, all-seeing divinity. "It's just these little moments here or there where he mutters something like, 'Maybe the universe didn't spring forth from my essence,' that make us worry he's not quite there. I mean, that's just not who he is." At press time, aides feared that Trump may never regain his faculties when he declared he was merely a demigod who would die after holding the presidency for a thousand years.
