CHICAGO--Worrying that he could be caught off guard anywhere, at any time, area man Dan Moritz on Friday was reportedly afraid some woman might come out of the woodwork to hold him accountable for something. "I'm honestly starting to get a little freaked out that a woman could, out of nowhere, start demanding that I take responsibility for something that I absolutely did," said Moritz, adding that he had no way of knowing if the woman who would suddenly hold him responsible for his actions would be a female friend, coworker, or even a woman he met only once at a party. "I can't shake the fear that, one day, I'm just minding my own business when I'm blindsided by a woman who's spent possibly years building up the courage to confront me with something horrible that was definitely my fault." Moritz went on to say that while he was anxious, all he could do was hope for the best and just keep living his life as he always had.
