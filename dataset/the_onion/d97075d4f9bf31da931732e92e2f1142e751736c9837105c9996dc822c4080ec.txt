BRASILIA, BRAZIL--Following the country's successful run to the World Cup round of 16 in Brazil, sources confirmed Friday that the tournament has already inspired an entirely new generation of young foreign players to someday play for the U.S. national team. "Just seeing guys like Julian Green and Jermaine Jones made me realize that when I get older, maybe I could figure out a way to become eligible to represent the United States," said 14-year-old soccer player and Frankfurt, Germany native Martin Kohler, who told reporters that watching the U.S. has motivated him to look into whether one of his grandparents might have been born in America, thereby allowing him to play for the team under FIFA eligibility rules. "Or maybe I could live in the States for five years and then join the U.S. team after playing for Germany at the youth level. It's a long shot, sure, but then again, there's no way I'll be good enough to play for Germany's senior team, so this will probably be the only way I can go to a World Cup." Kohler went on to express his confidence that despite his mediocre touch and middling passing ability, he could likely win a spot on the U.S. roster in time for the 2018 World Cup.
