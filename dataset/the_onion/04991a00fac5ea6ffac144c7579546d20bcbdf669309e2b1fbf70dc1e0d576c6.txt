BROOKLYN, NY--Calling the man's living conditions "utterly deplorable," officials from Roommate Protective Services confirmed today that they removed local Kevin Spyra this morning from a two-bedroom apartment filled with overflowing garbage bins, piles of unwashed dishes, and a refrigerator full of rotting food. "The squalid state of the apartment was extremely hazardous to the health and well-being of Kevin, and we had to get him out of there," local RPS officer Jim McCarthy said of the at-risk 22-year-old, adding that Spyra's negligent roommate Ben Stern, 23, had created an unsafe environment in which Kevin was constantly exposed to piles of foul-smelling dirty clothes, the stench of unwashed bath towels, Incubus blaring at 3 a.m., and scattered mugs with used tea bags crusted onto them. "We got a tip from a neighbor who said that she overheard Ben shouting at Kevin after Kevin politely asked when Ben would pay his share of the cable bill. It's tragic when you find a helpless 22-year-old roommate living like this." McCarthy went on to say that Spyra has been taken into protective custody, and that the most important thing now is to find him a healthy shared living situation with a roommate who isn't a complete dick.
