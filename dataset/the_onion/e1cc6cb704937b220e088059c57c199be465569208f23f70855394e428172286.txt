CHARLOTTE, NC--Early in the third quarter of last Sunday's game against the Saints, Carolina Panthers quarterback Matt Moore saw something terrifying and inhuman in the defense and called an audible, the visibly shaken quarterback later confirmed. "I didn't like what I saw out there, because, I swear to God, this thing had huge claws and fangs," said Moore, who frantically ran up and down the line of scrimmage pointing and screaming, warning his teammates about the ghoulish beast, and yelling "blue 32 falcon." "If I didn't change the play, then that thing--whatever the hell it was--would have killed [running back] Jonathan [Stewart], because it was right in perfect position to rip him to shreds." Moore, who changed the play from a toss right to a quick slant, was hit on the blind side and sacked for an eight-yard loss by a yeti.
