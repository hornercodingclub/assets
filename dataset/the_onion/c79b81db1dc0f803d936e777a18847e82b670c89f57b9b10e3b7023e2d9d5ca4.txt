OMAHA, NE--Admitting he wasn't really qualified to do much of anything else after all this time, local 34-year-old Ryan Wells told reporters Wednesday that, at this point, he might as well just keep following his dream of someday becoming a successful musician. "It's definitely too late for me to go back to school, and I'm not going to get an office job or anything like that with the resume I've got, so I figure, why not just stick with what I've been doing," said Wells, adding that he's okay with his current schedule of rehearsals and occasional late-night gigs and has grown accustomed to living in small apartments anyway, so he didn't see much of a problem with continuing to strive after his lifelong goal for the indefinite future. "It's not like anyone really expects anything different from me anymore, either; they all pretty much ask about how the band stuff is going right off the bat when I talk to them. So, I guess I'll just keep doing this from here on out." Wells went on to say that he foresees no real issues with his plan to keep following his dreams, provided that his roommate of eight years doesn't suddenly decide to move out.
