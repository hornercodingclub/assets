ATLANTA--Hawks forward Josh Smith regaled his teammates Wednesday with a story about how he once watched a red-tailed hawk swoop down, grab a loose basketball in its razor sharp talons, and fly away. "It was crazy, because the ball was rolling across the court really fast, and then I heard this loud screeching sound and all of a sudden this hawk dives down and snatches it up before it goes out of bounds," said Smith, adding that hawks build nests in the rafters of every NBA arena. "And then it flew off to the upper deck, where it landed by some empty seats and started tearing apart the basketball with its beak." Smith told his teammates that if they look closely at the court after each NBA game, they should be able to see hawk droppings containing undigested pieces of basketball.
