SAN JOSE, CA--Acknowledging that the progress made in such a short amount of time was remarkable, Club One Fitness personal trainer Logan Kaiser told reporters Tuesday he is very impressed by the improvement in both the strength and consistency of his client's excuses. "He's starting to come along; a few months ago he had really weak pretenses for not sticking to a workout plan, but he's put in a lot of effort and now he's sporting much more robust and powerful justifications," said Kaiser of 36-year-old software engineer Jeffrey McGann, noting that the gym member's exculpatory anecdotes had already tripled in size and were becoming far more difficult to verify. "After seeing how he struggled early on with a simple excuse about traffic, it's gratifying to see him push himself and dig deep for rationalizations that more believably exonerate him. And you can tell it's gotten a lot easier. His total commitment to tackling a long, grueling story about how construction in his neighborhood aggravated his dust mite allergies was outstanding." At press time, Kaiser expressed concern after learning that McGann would be unable to make it to the gym due to an unspecified workplace emergency.
