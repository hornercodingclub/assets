CHICAGO--Claiming its new offering "takes blandness to a whole new level," Quaker on Friday announced the release of new, plain-flavor-blasted rice cakes. "Our Plain-Blasted Rice Cakes have an extra kick of unflavored seasoning for maximum tastelessness in every bite," said spokesperson Michelle Wade, adding that the product had three times less flavor than regular rice cakes. "If you thought our original variety was completely devoid of any flavor, get ready for your taste buds to be put completely to sleep." Wade went on to say that Quaker would also be rolling out X-Treme Dry Rice Cakes that will be sold as a plastic bag filled with flour.
