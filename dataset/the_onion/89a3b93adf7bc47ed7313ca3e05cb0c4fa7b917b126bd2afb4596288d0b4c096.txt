HERNANDO, MS--Saying it was outrageously unfair that the film wasn't up for any awards, area man Lawrence Kent said Wednesday that he thinks the movie he saw should have been nominated for an Oscar. "That secret agent movie I saw should definitely have been nominated," Kent said indignantly of , the single film he watched in a theater last year, which reportedly featured numerous "cool action scenes" and "really good acting." "It had the best script. It totally kicked ass. Seriously, what is the Academy thinking?" Kent went on to say that the snub was just as much of an injustice as when , the single movie he saw in 2016, also didn't receive any nominations.
