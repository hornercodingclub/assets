CHARLOTTE, NC--Attempting to put together an offensive play during last night's matchup against the Detroit Pistons, the Charlotte Bobcats' starting five got lost while driving to the basket, team sources confirmed Sunday. "I was heading toward the hoop, but I must have taken a wrong turn in one of the lanes and ended up out of bounds with my teammates behind me," said Bobcats guard Gerald Henderson, who sources said could be seen wandering aimlessly through Time Warner Cable Arena for the bulk of the game's first half. "Then we circled through the concourse for almost an hour looking for our exit. I swear, we must have passed that same concession stand a dozen times." Upon finally asking a stadium worker for directions, the disoriented Bobcats reportedly made their way back to the court, to the vocal disappointment of fans, coaching personnel, and team owner Michael Jordan.
