CHICAGO--Local resident Daniel Paxson has reportedly heard dozens of accounts from numerous friendly sources in the past two weeks confirming that the new James Bond film is pretty good. According to persons with knowledge of the situation, an unnamed friend of Paxson's coworker Wendy Mathers watched the movie on opening weekend and found it to be "decent enough." News of this development is believed to have then led Mathers herself to see the film the following week. Though she was overheard describing its screenplay as "kind of forgettable," Mathers is said to have concluded that Daniel Craig's performance redeemed the movie overall, and according to witnesses, she voiced this opinion during a work meeting at which Paxon was present. Within a few days, a second coworker had reportedly seen the film and told Paxson it was "not the worst way [he] could spend a night out." Sources said the accumulation of these mostly positive reports led Paxson to decide the movie was probably good and to consider checking it out himself sometime this week. At press time, reports indicated Paxson was perusing theater listings and confused as to whether the new James Bond movie was titled , , , or .
