Rachel Maddow accused Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) of plagiarizing four lines of a recent speech from the Wikipedia page on the 1997 film , while others noted that Paul appeared to borrow several lines from the Wikipedia entry on the 1988 drama during a speech earlier this year. What do think? "I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!" Alexa Keating * Granite Polisher "I see how plagiarizing Wikipedia would be tempting. There are so many beautiful passages." Trevor Langdon * Unemployed "Trying to slip a quote by Maddow is a fool's errand." Keith Lee * Ferris Wheel Operator
