GLENDALE, AZ--With his perfect season and the Patriots' championship at stake in Super Bowl XLII, celebrity athlete and future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady dug deep within himself to be outplayed by Giants journeyman passer Eli Manning."To raise the level of our game and win on the biggest stage like this--it feels amazing," everyone assumed four-time Pro Bowler Brady would say following the historic game, only to hear those words spoken not only by a Manning, but by a non-Peyton Manning. Given the chance to become the only team in league history to go 19-0, Brady put his team on his shoulders and led the Patriots in a fourth-quarter comeback, scoring the go-ahead touchdown late in the game, an inspiring 12-play drive topped only by Manning's own 12-play touchdown drive immediately afterwards, a feat the Giants QB referred to as "cool." Manning followed up his Super Bowl MVP performance by not ripping up his ACL or MCL in the 2008 season.
