NEW YORK--Praising the 5'11", 295-pound man's bulging muscles and massive, ripped physique, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced their selection of bodybuilder Manfred Sampson with the first pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Thursday. "Just look at him--he's enormous. How is anyone ever going to guard this dude?" said general manager Chris Grant, adding that Sampson is so strong he could probably dominate at any position he wants. "Mark my words: Manfred Sampson will bring a championship to Cleveland. I mean, how could he not? He's like the most jacked guy I've ever seen. Christ, his forearms are as big as fucking suspension cables." With the draft's second pick, the Orlando Magic selected 8'3" Turkish man Sultan Kosen, the tallest person in the world.
