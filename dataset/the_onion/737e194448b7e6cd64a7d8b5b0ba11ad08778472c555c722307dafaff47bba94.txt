SANTA CLARITA, CA--Instantly mobilizing in response to a coworker's positive remark about his job performance, local marketing assistant Devin Brandt's neuroses really put the genuine compliment he received through the wringer Monday, sources confirmed. "There had to be an ulterior motive hidden in there somewhere, right? Or maybe he was being sarcastic," Brandt reportedly thought as three decades of neurotic impulses worked over the honest-to-goodness praise from every conceivable angle, quickly ripping it to shreds. "Oh, God, what if he complimented me out of pity? Maybe I'm doing such a bad job that he felt he had to say something nice just to make me feel better about myself." Sources confirmed that while the compliment was forced to run the full gauntlet of Brandt's neuroses, a tiny slight directed toward him later in the day was able to take root in his brain unhindered.
