LOS ANGELES--Following a team practice Friday, sources confirmed that new Lakers center Dwight Howard gave an inspiring press conference performance in which he made talking look practically effortless. "He was running his mouth better than ever out there," said reporter Helene Elliott, adding that Howard is "just a total natural" when it comes to incessantly rambling about winning NBA championships. "Having spent so much time out injured, everyone was a little worried that Dwight might not be able to blather on and on at the same level he once did, but he silenced any of those concerns right away with a few arrogant and self-involved comments. His mouth was moving so fluidly that it was like he wasn't even trying. It was amazing to watch." At press time, Howard was preparing for Tuesday night's opening-season press conference by practicing forced smiles and fake laughter in front of a locker-room mirror.
