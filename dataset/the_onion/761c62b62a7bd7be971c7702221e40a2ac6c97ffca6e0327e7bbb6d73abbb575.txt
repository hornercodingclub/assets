SOMERS, CT--Taking part in the popular autumn tradition, players, coaches, and owners from across the NBA reportedly traveled to several Connecticut farms Friday to pick basketballs. "This is the perfect time of year to walk around a basketball patch with your team and choose a few big orange Spaldings to bring home," league commissioner Adam Silver told reporters as players excitedly picked up various basketballs to check if they were solid and fully inflated. "The air is crisp, the leaves have changed colors, and basketballs are ripe and regulation-size. The farms up here have a great selection of basketballs that will last the whole regular season before they start rotting, and it's always nice to see the smiles on the younger rookies while they walk around hugging their freshly picked basketballs with both hands." Silver added that he usually brings a few of the smaller, oddly colored basketballs back with him to donate to the WNBA.
