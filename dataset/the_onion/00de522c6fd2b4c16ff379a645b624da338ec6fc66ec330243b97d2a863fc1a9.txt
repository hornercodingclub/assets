Pizza Hut is developing a "subconscious" pizza menu based on eye-tracking technology that works by showing diners a selection of toppings, measuring how much time their eyes linger on specific ingredients, and then generating a pizza the person can either accept or change.

My subconscious has never been very good at pairing flavors." Eloise Jergens * Classroom Assistant "I hope my eyes look at the pepperoni. That's my favorite." Brian Kraft * Personal Driver
