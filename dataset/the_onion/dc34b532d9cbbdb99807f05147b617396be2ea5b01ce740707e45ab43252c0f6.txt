RUSTON, LA--Forty-nine-year-old NBA Hall of Famer Karl Malone told reporters Monday that in addition to helping coach Louisiana Tech's team and escaping to his second home in Alaska, he still finds time to make new posters of himself for kids to hang on their bedroom walls. "With these computer programs now, it's super easy to make them at home, throw the files on a Zip disk, and bring them to Kinko's, where they print them out," said Malone, showing reporters a few of his favorite designs, including one featuring the power forward dressed in a postal service uniform that says "The Mailman," and another of him striking a pose while dunking, which he called "a total classic." "People think posters have gone out of style, but no way. A kid turns 12, gets to decorate his own room, what's he gonna choose? Posters. And that's where 'The Mailman' comes in." Malone declined to comment on how much revenue is generated by his posters, saying only that he "gets by," which is more than can be said of former Golden State Warrior Chris Mullin, who just last year ceased production of his line of Chris Mullin trading cards due to declining sales.
