INDIANAPOLIS--Noticeably cringing as he recalled repeatedly stumbling over his questions, Cleveland Browns chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta expressed concern to reporters Tuesday that the team may have completely blown their NFL combine interview with Cal quarterback Jared Goff. "I can't believe some of the stupid stuff that came out of my mouth--I just got so nervous that I wound up asking all the wrong things," said DePodesta, adding that the team's entire front office was anxiously fidgeting throughout the 15-minute meeting. "At one point, I was rambling about how well I thought he would fit into the Browns offense, and then I lost my train of thought, so I just sort of trailed off. I could tell he wasn't impressed at all. God, I wish we could just do it over again." DePodesta added that the team likely came off as "totally fake and insincere" while assuring Goff that they have learned from their past mistakes.
