NEW YORK--According to sources, a recently aired TV ad featuring dozens of rum-guzzling pirates swinging on ropes while dancing with scantily clad women to Caribbean steel-drum music also included a voice-over narration urging viewers to use caution while consuming alcohol. "Please drink responsibly," said the ad's narrator, just seconds after a group of boisterous, maniacally laughing pirates sang a sea chanty and hoisted brimming mugs of alcohol while firing every one of the ship's deck cannons. According to sources, the ad was followed by a commercial in which a child drizzles frosting on a toaster strudel while a narrator says, "part of a balanced breakfast."
