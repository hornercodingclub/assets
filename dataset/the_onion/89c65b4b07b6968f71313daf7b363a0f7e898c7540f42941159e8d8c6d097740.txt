OMAHA, NE--According to sources, local fussy eater Bryan Wilcox, who is known for refusing to eat any type of food he hasn't tried before or that falls outside of his narrow zone of comfort, is 38 years old. "Can I just get it plain, without sauce?" asked the adult man, who was born in 1975, has a 401k, a spouse, and two young children, yet frowns and shakes his head at the sight of shellfish, most varieties of vegetable, or any sandwich that hasn't first had its crust removed. "Is it touching tomatoes? I don't want it if it's touching tomatoes." Sources later confirmed that Wilcox, a fully grown human, just pushed his food around his plate until he got to have dessert.
