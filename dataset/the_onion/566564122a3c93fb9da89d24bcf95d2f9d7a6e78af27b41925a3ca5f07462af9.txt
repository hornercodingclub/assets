WASHINGTON--The White House was briefly placed on lockdown Friday morning after "an addled and emotionally distraught" President Obama was reportedly caught trying to scale the North Lawn fence, the third such attempt this year, Secret Service officials confirmed. "At approximately 11:05 a.m., we were alerted that the president was climbing the barrier along Pennsylvania Avenue, at which time our agents moved quickly to apprehend him and ensure he made it no further," said Secret Service director Joseph Clancy, who later stated the agency would look into raising the height of the fence given the increased frequency of such incidents. "He was a little shaken up after agents wrestled him to the ground, but he should be fine. Despite all of his kicking and incoherent screaming, which clearly indicated his severe level of mental distress, we were able to cuff him and haul him off to the Oval Office in a prompt and efficient manner." Clancy added that, while the Secret Service does everything in its power to use nonlethal force, should a determined Obama ever make it over the fence and start charging directly away from the White House, they'd likely have no choice but to open fire.
