--Following tonight's debate between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, millions of Americans took to the Internet to read the views and responses of others so that they themselves could ultimately figure out how they felt about the candidates' performances. "I need to see what complete and total strangers are saying on Twitter and , read what the political pundits on CNN.com are writing, and then maybe I can reach my own conclusion about the debate I just watched," said Raleigh, NC resident Jarrod Kakofski, adding that while he has a "gut feeling" about who won the contest, he would rather see if those thoughts are supported by political analysts and other online commentators "just in case [his] opinion ends up being wrong." "I won't be able to offer any ideas about the candidates' policy proposals, body language, or overall relatability until I get online and am told which person I was supposed to like most." Viewers nationwide also confirmed they would need to consult before deciding what they thought about the performance of debate moderator Candy Crowley.
