PHOENIX--Visibly moved by the outpouring of rancor before of him, President Trump was reportedly struck by the beautiful vision of what America could be while looking out over a seething, screaming Arizona rally on Tuesday. "As I gaze upon the snarls on your red faces today, I'm filled with hope at what astonishing hostility the America of tomorrow can achieve," said the president, swelling with optimism at the inspiring scene of thousands of Americans gathering to act on their basest instincts. "I'm simply overcome by the bitterness and resentment filling this convention center. Just imagine if everyone in the nation--every single man and every single woman--could let their anger and intolerance consume them the way it has the good people in this room. What a wonderful country this would be." Trump went on to say that while progress would not always be easy, the uncontainable rage of crowds like this one made him feel like America was well on its way.
