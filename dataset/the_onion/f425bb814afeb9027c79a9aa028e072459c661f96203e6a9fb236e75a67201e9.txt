ALBANY, NY--Feeling completely unprepared for such a difficult conversation, local father Michael Dorgan was reportedly struggling Monday to answer all his son's questions about what a catch is. "God, this so awkward, he was watching the Super Bowl last night, and now he has so many questions and I can't describe how it works," said Dorgan, who admitted to stammering his way through an uncomfortable 10-minute explanation of what a football move is. "I tried bringing out a football to show him what maintaining possession means, but I think it just confused him more. And there was this painful silence after he asked about controlling the ball long enough to become a runner. How do you explain something as complicated and mysterious as that to your son? I wish he just asked his mother." Dorgan added that something as important and complicated as what a catch is should definitely be taught in school.
