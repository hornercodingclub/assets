BALTIMORE--Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco told reporters Wednesday he was excited to work with new offensive coordinator Jim Caldwell, expressing enthusiasm about learning as much as possible from the man who was coached by former Colts quarterback Peyton Manning. "It'll be great to pick Caldwell's brain and find out what he learned in Indianapolis while working under one of the best quarterbacks of all time," Flacco said. "I'm sure Jim has some really cool stories about being mentored by a four-time MVP, but mostly I want to find out what it was like when he was coached to a Super Bowl by Manning." At press time, Flacco was reportedly thrilled about hosting the Denver Broncos on Sunday, explaining to teammates and coaches that he couldn't wait to see, in person, an accomplished quarterback who is admired by millions.
