WASHINGTON--Saying the new effort would help them make critical inroads with low-income rural voters following a stunning election loss last week, the Democratic National Committee announced the launch of a new -inspired web series Tuesday starring Lena Dunham intended to connect with working-class Americans and address their most pressing concerns. "We're hoping to make up the ground we lost with white working-class voters and union members who once made up our base with a new 10-part hip-hop musical set in rural Wisconsin, featuring a down-on-her-luck manufacturing worker played by Lena Dunham," said DNC interim chair Donna Brazile, who added that, in an effort to appeal to economically distressed voters, each episode would see the protagonists tackle a different theme, such as taxes or free trade, through the choreography of five-time Tony winner Susan Stroman. "We are confident that with the help of Josh Gad, Debra Messing, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and the creative team behind , we can bring Americans who feel like they have been left behind by globalization back to the Democratic Party. Viewers will also have the chance to win a trip to be in the audience at a live TED Talk taping if they share the series on Instagram, which we believe will draw considerable interest across the nation's heartland." Brazile added that the web series would be available exclusively through Seeso and HBO Go.
