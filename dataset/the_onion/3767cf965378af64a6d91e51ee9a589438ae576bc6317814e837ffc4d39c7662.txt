According to reports from some publications covering the Cannes Film Festival, a number of women who were wearing flats instead of high heels were turned away from the red carpet for a high-profile screening unless they changed shoes, and actor Josh Brolin allegedly responded that he would walk the red carpet in high heels to protest the policy. What do think? "I can't count the movies that have been ruined for me by some broad wearing flats right in the front row." Brian Woodruff * Museum Manager "If this was just an elaborate plot to get Josh Brolin walking the red carpet in heels, it was worth it." Debra Toothman * Unemployed "I'm so sick of these beautiful women not doing everything they can to look their best." Lauren Kinney * Diversity Advocate
