NEW YORK--Nearly a month after the end of the referee lockout, the NFL is still struggling to remove frightened and confused replacement officials from replay booths, league sources confirmed Monday. "Every time I enter the booth, I find a couple bewildered replacement refs inside, skittishly bumping into each other and all the equipment," crew chief Ed Hochuli said. "I swear I took one guy out of there twice. He didn't seem to understand the words 'get out of here,' so I had to go get a broom to scare him off." Hochuli confirmed that he found one replacement referee covered in blood from repeatedly attempting to exit the booth through the replay monitor.
