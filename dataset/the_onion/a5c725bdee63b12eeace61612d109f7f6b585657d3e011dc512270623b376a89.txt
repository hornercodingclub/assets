KNOXVILLE, TN--CBS college basketball commentators Billy Packer and Vern Lundquist took time during Sunday's Kentucky-Tennessee basketball game, a competition played with the goal of producing a victor, to praise Volunteers senior guard Chris Lofton, whose job on the team is to aid the team in winning, for being competitive. "Lofton loves competition--he'll try to beat you any way he can," Lundquist said of Lofton, whose function on the team is to produce points while preventing the other team from doing so in turn. "He's just one of those athletes who really wants to win and hates to lose." Packer echoed his colleague's thoughts, adding that Lofton was "a real basketball player" and "quite an athlete."
