NEW YORK--Saying that such a vital judgment call required the expertise of a truly moronic decision maker, employees at Cartwright Partners passed an important issue up the corporate ladder to the company's highest-ranking idiot Tuesday, sources reported. "I'm just a mid-level pea brain, so when this decision landed on my desk from one of the nimrods on my team, I knew I had to run it up the flagpole all the way to the top dope in my department," said account manager Alan Rasche, who reportedly sent a detailed memo up the boob chain to the highest pinhead in the local office, but quickly learned that even she couldn't adequately address it and had to send it up to a higher dipshit in company headquarters. "From what I hear, they're bringing in all the top dumbfuck brass to weigh in on this one, and the ultimate decision is going to come down from the company's very highest dimwit. This is why the shit-for-brains executives in corporate get paid the big bucks." Sources said they were confident the company's top idiot would render an absolutely lunkheaded decision that the company's low-level nitwits would then have to spend months trying to fix.
