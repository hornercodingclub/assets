Subway has said that it will begin removing the chemical azodicarbonamide from its sandwich bread after a prominent food blogger pointed out that the same additive is used in yoga mats and shoe rubber. What do think? "Did Subway reveal which chemical they use to keep all their meats soaking wet?" Michael Davis * Systems Analyst "I applaud the effort to keep shoes and bread separate, but it's a losing battle." Irene Long * Scenic Artist "Great, now I have to go back to eating Reeboks stuffed with meat." Chris Heitman * Project Manager
