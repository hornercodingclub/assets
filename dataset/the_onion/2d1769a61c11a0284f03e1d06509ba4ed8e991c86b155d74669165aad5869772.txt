NEW YORK--According to confused onlookers inside Penn Station, recently fired New York Rangers head coach John Tortorella is currently wandering around the major rail terminal yelling at complete strangers to clear the puck into the neutral zone. "C'mon! Cover the goddamn high slot and clear the zone!" said a disheveled and slightly off-balance Tortorella, who was reportedly screaming at an elderly couple about to board an Amtrak train to Boston. "Wake up and get the forecheck going right now! I don't want to hear any excuses--just get out there and either crash the net or move the puck out to point and put some fucking shots on net!" At press time, eyewitnesses confirmed that Tortorella was shouting at travelers in the Grand Concourse to gather around him to talk about the team's "pathetic penalty kill." UPDATE: Reports just confirmed that Tortorella is shouting at a New Jersey Transit employee for missing a blatant cross-checking penalty on the boards. UPDATE: According to sources, Tortorella is now incoherently shrieking about "getting the third line off the ice" while frantically pacing around the Penn Station food court.
