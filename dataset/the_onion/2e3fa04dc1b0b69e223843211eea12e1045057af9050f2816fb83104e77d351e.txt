LOS ANGELES--To celebrate his contributions to television and remember the tragic circumstances that surrounded his death, the Teen Choice Awards posthumously honored Cory Monteith Sunday by giving him a surfboard. "We could think of no more fitting tribute to Cory than a colorful surfboard covered in palm tree decals," said Teen Choice Awards director Michael Dempsey, adding that he hopes the Monteith family appreciates the surfboard. "The greatest tragedy is that Cory didn't live to earn more surfboards." Other surfboard winners from last night include the Kardashians, Miley Cyrus, and Twitter.
