Two tourists visiting the Loggia dei Militi palace in Cremona, Italy reportedly tried to take a selfie with an 18th-century marble statue depicting two figures of Hercules by climbing on it, causing a large marble crown at its top to fall off and shatter. What do think? "It was probably about time to get a new statue anyway."

Katy Hart * Snack Food Tester "It's fine. They should be able to Photoshop it back together." Anthony Williams * Suitcase Packer
