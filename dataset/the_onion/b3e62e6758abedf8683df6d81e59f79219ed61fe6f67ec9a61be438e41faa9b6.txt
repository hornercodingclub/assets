MILWAUKEE--While shopping for used equipment at a local Play It Again Sports franchise Tuesday, Bucks general manager John Hammond reportedly came across a mildly damaged Shaq in good working condition next to a bin filled with old tennis balls. "There's definitely been a little wear and tear, and it doesn't look so great, but for $20, I really couldn't pass it up," Hammond said. "The last couple owners didn't really take very good care of it, but it's more than good enough for the Bucks." Guard Michael Redd later told reporters he wished Hammond had purchased a basketball instead, saying that he was tired of practicing jump shots with a rolled-up sock.
