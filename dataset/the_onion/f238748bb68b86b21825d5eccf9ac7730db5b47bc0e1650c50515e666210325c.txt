NEW YORK--While reading in a wet, tattered copy of the about musician Lou Reed's death as she waited in line for methadone outside the Bellevue Offsite Clinic in New York's East Village this morning, homeless transvestite heroin addict Cookie Williams confirmed to reporters that today was going to be an especially rough day for her. "Even by the standard of how a day usually goes for me, I think today is now officially shaping up to be a doozy," said Williams, 38, adding that hearing the news of the rock legend and Velvet Underground founder's death at age 71 was "pretty much the last thing [she] needed" after waking up to infected blister pains this morning. "Granted, if you take away Lou Reed's death, we're still looking at a real motherfucker of a day for me, no question. But this sure as hell ain't helping." Williams later told reporters that, given the news, she was just going to take it easy today and nod off in Tompkins Square Park for 11 hours straight.
