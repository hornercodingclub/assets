CHICAGO--Having finished saying goodbye to Cubs players and fans during his final game with the team, manager Lou Piniella won his second World Series Sunday night mere seconds after taking off his uniform. "This is a great way to end my career, no question," a champagne-soaked Piniella told reporters, moments after winning the National League Central while removing his blue-pinstriped Cubs pants and the NLCS after tossing his Cubs hat to the team's equipment manager. "Man, it feels good to finally be on top again." The Chicago Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908.
