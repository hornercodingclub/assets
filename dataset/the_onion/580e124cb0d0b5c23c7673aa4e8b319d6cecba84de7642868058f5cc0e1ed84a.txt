CLEVELAND--Following the quarterback's recent concussion against the Steelers, Cleveland Browns head coach Rob Chudzinski told reporters Tuesday that Jason Campbell has been cleared by team doctors to resume light brain activity. "Jason passed all the necessary tests yesterday, so he's now been given the green light to carry out some very basic cerebral functions," said Chudzinski, adding that the 31-year-old play caller has already begun sending neural signals to his cardiovascular system to pump blood throughout his body, as well as using his brain stem to subconsciously control the rate of his breathing. "The doctors are quite happy with his ability to regulate his heartbeat, display elementary motor control of his body, and form thoughts, so we're hoping to have him speaking and using intellectual reasoning by the end of the week. And Jason himself is very eager to get back on the field as soon as possible, at least from what we can gather based on his facial expressions." At press time, team sources confirmed that Campbell was sitting motionless on the floor of the Browns' practice facility and quietly drooling on himself.
