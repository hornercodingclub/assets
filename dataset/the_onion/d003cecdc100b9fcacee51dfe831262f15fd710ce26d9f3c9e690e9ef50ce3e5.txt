WASHINGTON--Urging calm after citizens awoke to find the country's political boundaries had disappeared completely, authorities announced Thursday that a devastating gerrymandering blunder had left the United States devoid of any district, state, or national borders whatsoever. "Though our investigation is still ongoing, it appears the North Carolina General Assembly may have inadvertently wiped out all local and federal boundaries while redrawing the state's already heavily manipulated fourth congressional district late last night," said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, addressing the millions of panicked Americans now living in flux and untethered to any known county, city ward, rural township, or municipal water district. "As of now, we have no way of indicating where one location ends and another begins, let alone the ability to separate ourselves from Canada and Mexico. Though we are working to redraw our borders as soon as possible, it is vital that no one in the United States or its territories travel outside their home until further notice." Earnest went on to acknowledge that despite the ensuing chaos, the massive upheaval of district lines will likely prove advantageous to incumbent electoral candidates.
