NASHVILLE, TN--Stressing the importance of the fan base's health and wellbeing, Vanderbilt University chancellor Nicholas Zeppos advised Commodore football fans Thursday to get vaccinated before the team's Southeastern Conference road schedule begins next week. "Those of you travelling into parts of the country like Gainesville, Oxford, or Columbia will be exposing yourself to a wide array of diseases and viruses, and we strongly urge you to consult with your doctor and ensure your immunizations are up to date prior to the start of SEC play," Zeppos said in an email to Vanderbilt students, faculty, and alumni, urging them to carefully consider the risks before choosing to attend any conference road games. "Whether you're traveling into the East or West division, adequate precautions are vital. In the event you or your healthcare provider are unable to take the proper steps towards vaccination, we ask that you remain home for your own safety and that of the entire Vanderbilt community." The advisory concluded by reminding fans that anyone planning on attending a road game tailgate should visit the Student Health Center for free typhoid tablets.
