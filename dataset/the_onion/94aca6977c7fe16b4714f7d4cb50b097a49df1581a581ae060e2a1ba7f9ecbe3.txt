LAS VEGAS--WBC welterweight champion Floyd "Pretty Boy" Mayweather expressed concern Tuesday over the training methods employed by his corner man and uncle Roger Mayweather, as he has not yet thrown a single punch while training for his upcoming "superfight" against multi-division world champion Oscar De La Hoya. "Uncle Roger's been putting me through plenty of, you know, running and jump-rope and footwork stuff, plus some medicine-ball drills and some lifting, but I haven't even had gloves on for weeks," Mayweather told a magazine reporter writing an article on his stationary-bicycle technique. "I mean, he's telling me I'm doing great, he says it's not like I forgot how to hit or anything, but come on--shouldn't I at least do some work on a speed bag or throw some combinations at a sparring partner before going into the biggest fight in boxing history instead of all this Pilates?" De La Hoya has also expressed frustration with his own training regimen, which has thus far consisted of eating egg salad sandwiches while watching daytime television.
