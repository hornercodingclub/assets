NASHVILLE, TN--Recounting Monday's Titans practice to colleagues, sports reporter Jim Wyatt referred to multiple players on the team as "my buddy" and on more than one occasion described himself as "one of the guys." "Oh, man, [wide receiver] Kenny [Britt] is so hilarious, you should have heard the stories he was telling me this afternoon," Wyatt said to several coworkers, referencing the eight-minute group interview Britt gave to Wyatt and 14 other members of the press. "I'm pretty sure a lot of the guys hang out at Mystic, so I'm thinking about popping by there after work. They'll flip when they see me show up. Those guys love me." When asked for their opinion of Wyatt, several members of the Titans asked if he was the pasty one in his 30s and said he "seemed fine."
