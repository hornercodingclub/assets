LOS ANGELES--Ahead of his impending free agency, Lakers center Dwight Howard told reporters Thursday that he is "very interested" in moving to Houston and completely ruining the Rockets. "They have a great young core of players with James Harden and Jeremy Lin, so I'd obviously love the chance to go shatter their chemistry and tear the entire locker room apart," said Howard, adding that he would "relish the opportunity" to totally undermine Rockets head coach Kevin McHale. "There are a few teams on my radar right now. Dallas has a really solid roster too, and I'm definitely intrigued by the prospect of clashing with Dirk Nowitzki and running that whole franchise into the ground. We'll just have to wait and see what happens." Howard did stress to reporters, however, that he has not yet ruled out remaining in Los Angeles to continue destroying the Lakers for the foreseeable future.
