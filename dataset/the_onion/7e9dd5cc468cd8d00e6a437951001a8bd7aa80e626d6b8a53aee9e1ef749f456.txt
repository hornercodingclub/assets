WASHINGTON--A satisfied smirk spreading across his face as he watched them finish their meals, a cackling Donald Trump reportedly revealed to dinner guests Tuesday that each and every one of them had just eaten a single piece of his tax returns. "Now that you're done dining, let me ask: Did you notice anything, shall we say, interesting about your entrees?" said the president, who caused those seated in the State Dining Room to look down at their now empty plates in revulsion as he gleefully revealed that he had diced up over 20 years of pages from his federal and New York State tax filings and sprinkled them into each of the meal's seven lavish courses. "Dr. Bornstein, you seemed to enjoy your duck roulades. And my good professor, that crab risotto certainly agreed with you. Well, would it surprise you to learn that the dishes you've all just partaken of contain morsels of my 1099-Bs from 1995 to 2015? Quite delicious, weren't they? Please, please don't be shy about asking for seconds." At press time, as the disgusted guests stood up from the table and hastily exited, a giddy Trump called out to remind them that they hadn't even had dessert yet.
