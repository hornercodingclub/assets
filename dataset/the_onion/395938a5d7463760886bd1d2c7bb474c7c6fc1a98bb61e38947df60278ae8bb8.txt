HAZEL PARK, MI--Claiming that this season has been pretty entertaining, casual football fan Reggie Butler, 29, told reporters Sunday that he was ready to introduce his parents to the NFL, predicting that his mother and father would probably enjoy all its unexpected twists and turns. "I got really into it last year, and that season ended with like this big thing that I think Mom and Dad would really like," said Butler, adding that the NFL "gets better and better as you watch it." "I was blown away by the finale. The way they resolved it. I never saw it coming. Early in the year it wasn't as good, but now there are all these new storylines developing and a lot of great recurring characters." At press time, Butler had reportedly decided to take his parents to a live NFL performance.
