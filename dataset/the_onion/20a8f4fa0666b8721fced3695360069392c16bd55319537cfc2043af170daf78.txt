--Film actor and director Ben Affleck was recognized today for his work as an outstanding bud with a nomination for Best Friend of Matt Damon. "I am deeply honored to be nominated for this prestigious award, as I have worked hard to hone my craft as Matt Damon's friend for over 32 years," said the 40-year-old star of the nomination, after expressing gratitude that his spouse, actress Jennifer Garner, will be the recipient of this year's Lifetime Wife of Ben Affleck Award. "I think a win has to be considered something of a long shot, but I already won this award back in '97, so it's really just nice to be recognized this time out." At press time, Hollywood insiders reported Affleck is expected to lose the Best Friend of Matt Damon award to actor John Krasinski.
