WASHINGTON--Amid intense nationwide scrutiny of the polarizing blaze, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Tuesday came out in support of a controversial wildfire in Southern California. "While I recognize that there has been some debate as to its merits, I nevertheless see no reason not to pledge my support to this outstanding and highly capable wildfire," said Zinke, adding that, despite some recent negative attention from the media, the raging conflagration has dutifully and honorably consumed tens of thousands of acres. "It's a truly wonderful inferno that I've gotten to know very well and that, frankly, doesn't get enough credit for all the hard work it does." At press time, Zinke reaffirmed his support for the wildfire despite its contentious decision to force thousands of people to evacuate their homes.
