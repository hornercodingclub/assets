GREEN BAY, WI--The NFL's highly visible efforts to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month succeeded this week in motivating Green Bay nose tackle B.J. Raji to schedule an appointment with Packers doctors to receive a mammogram, team sources confirmed Thursday. "This is a very serious deal, and you can't get this stuff checked out too soon," said Raji, who had just administered a breast self-examination in the team's locker room while encouraging defensive end Ryan Pickett to do the same. "It's important to get to know how your breasts normally look and feel. I have to check myself as often and carefully as possible, because pretty much my whole body is lumps." Raji, who has recently become more concerned about his health, also asked team doctors to perform a cervical screening.
