CINCINNATI--Calling it a quick and simple way to achieve a "radiant, youthful glow," health and beauty giant Olay announced the launch of its new line of pre-moisturized skin Wednesday. "Olay Hydrating Effects Epidermal Layer Plus is guaranteed to give women the luscious, dazzling skin they've always wanted," Olay marketing director Devin Salazar said in a press release, adding that consumers who purchase the 6-ounce jar of human skin can use it to touch up "trouble areas," immediately reversing the effects of drying, aging, or discoloration. "Just tear off as much or as little skin as you need, apply it where desired, and enjoy the confidence that comes from knowing you can have a fresh, young face at any age." Salazar went on to state that the new product contains no additives or synthetic chemicals, as it is procured entirely from all-natural sources.
