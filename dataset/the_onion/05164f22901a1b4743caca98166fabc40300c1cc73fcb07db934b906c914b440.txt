After New Jersey governor Chris Christie posted a video online of him squishing a spider with his hand while meeting with a group of children, the president of PETA issued a response chiding Christie for not thinking about the spider's worth as a living being. What do think? "How quickly PETA forgets the topless poster that Christie posed in for them in '07." Anne Vergallo * Systems Analyst "Too bad there wasn't a political cartoonist on hand to write something on the spider, like 'deficit' or something." Oliver Kassovitz * Bookbinder "Well, there go his chances in 2016." Giles Robin * Employment Counselor
