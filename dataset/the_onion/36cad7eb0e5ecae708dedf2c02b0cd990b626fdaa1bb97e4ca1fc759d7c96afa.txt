MASON, MI--Admitting that she doesn't often get the chance to indulge herself, local mother of three Beth Everson announced plans Tuesday to boil a mouthguard just for herself for a change. "It feels like I'm always boiling a mouthguard for one of my kids, so for once, I'm going to set aside some free time to boil one for me," said the 46-year-old, adding that with her adolescent sons playing both football and lacrosse, she rarely gets the opportunity to submerge a mouthguard into a bowl of boiling water in order to fit the rubber to her own teeth. "Don't get me wrong, I love boiling mouthguards for my boys. But every now and then, I could really use an afternoon to just boil a nice mouthguard and then bite down on it myself for 30 or 40 seconds." At press time, a contented Everson was quietly reading in the family's living room while wearing a new mouthguard.
