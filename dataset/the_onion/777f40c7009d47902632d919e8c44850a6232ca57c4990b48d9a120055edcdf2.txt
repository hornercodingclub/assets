CHICAGO--Calling it "disrespectful" and "totally disgusting," members of the Chicago Bulls expressed their frustration to reporters Wednesday over point guard Derrick Rose's habit of always leaving his torn ligaments strewn all over their locker room. "Every time I walk in here after practice or a game, I see Derrick's shredded MCLs and ACLs just lying on the floor, and it's ridiculous," said small forward Jimmy Butler, who added that he and his teammates have repeatedly implored Rose to clean up the wet, tattered bands of connective tissue that he regularly leaves sitting in puddles of synovial fluid around nearby lockers. "Not only is it gross, but yesterday Pau [Gasol] threw out one that he almost slipped on in the bathroom. They're Derrick's ligaments, so we shouldn't have to pick up after him like this. We're sick of it." Butler added that he and his teammates have also spoken to Rose about his chunks of knee cartilage that routinely clog the facility's shower drains.
