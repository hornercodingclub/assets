KAMPALA, UGANDA--Powerball mania continues to grip Uganda after last night's nationwide lottery drawing failed to generate a winner, pushing the prize total up to a staggering 31 grains of rice. "It's official: This will be the largest jackpot we've ever awarded," said a spokesman for the Ugandan Lottery, noting that the prize had surpassed the 29 rice grains claimed by a group of 17 widowed mothers in November of last year. "Hold on to your tickets, because whoever is lucky enough to pick the winning numbers will be able to add a basic nutrient to their diet that they need to avoid starving to death. It truly could be a life-changing amount of rice." The spokesman added that if there is only one winner, that person can choose between receiving the 31 rice grains over a period of 10 years or accepting a lump sum of 22 grains now.
