NASHVILLE--According to multiple sources, New York Giants running back Tiki Barber walked over to the Titans locker room and informed a celebrating Tennessee squad that his team could hear "everything" the Titans were saying about the Giants' poor performance following their 24-21 loss. "Listen, it's just not very sportsmanlike to call our quarterback a 'choke artist' and our entire team 'an overpaid bunch of losers,'" Barber said to the Titans, who fell completely silent when Barber first entered the room. "Is this what you guys are about? Kicking a team when they're down? Kind of takes away from all that 'good game' crap and hugging we just did on the field, doesn't it? You should all be ashamed of yourselves." While Barber was delivering his speech, the entire Tennessee squad reportedly failed to suppress laughter, forcing Barber to tell them several times that he was serious and didn't know what was so funny.
