LOS ANGELES-- Fresh off her victory in last night's finale of , 16-year-old country singer Chevel Shepherd told reporters Wednesday she was excited to use the $50 Chili's gift card she received for winning the televised singing competition. "After all those months of hard work, to win 50 bucks to spend on anything I want at Chili's--it's truly a dream come true!" said Shepherd, revealing that she planned to select items from the casual dining chain's three-for-$10 menu in order to make the most of her winnings. "There were definitely moments during the competition when I didn't know if I truly had what it takes to win. But my coach, Kelly [Clarkson], just encouraged me to visualize myself walking off the stage with that gift card in my hand, and that's what kept me going. I'll definitely be treating her to some Southwestern egg rolls or Cajun chicken pasta! I am very blessed." Shepherd added that she was proud of the other three finalists, who each received a coupon for half-off any entree from Chili's, and suggested maybe they could all go out to celebrate together sometime.
