WASHINGTON--In an effort to undermine the credibility of the woman who testified that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school, Senator Chuck Grassley reportedly scratched "Christine Blasey's a slut" into a Senate bathroom stall Monday. Sources confirmed that Grassley, 85, an Iowa Republican who has served in the Senate since 1981, spent 20 minutes grinning to himself while using a key to etch the message into the paint on the stall door and saying, "That'll show the lying tramp for dragging Brett through the mud." Other writing adjacent to Grassley's message on the Capitol building stall reportedly included "For a good time call Monica Lewinsky," a crude drawing of a penis ejaculating onto a woman labeled "Hillary Clinton," as well as a nearly 30-year-old faded message in black Sharpie reading "Anita Hill is a whore" that Grassley recognized as his own handwriting. At press time, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) had led FBI investigators into the bathroom to show them the message, saying it offered conclusive evidence that Dr. Blasey Ford's accusations were entirely baseless and that she clearly had no integrity whatsoever.
