SEATTLE--Stressing the importance of treating all its staff members equally, progressive technology firm Northstar Solutions described to reporters Wednesday its strict policy of paying both male and female workers 78 percent of what they should be earning. "At Northstar, we've always believed that employees who contribute the same level of hard work for the same duties should earn the same meager fraction of a reasonable wage, regardless of whether they're men or women," said the company's founder and CEO, Jack Stargell, who noted that every staff member's compensation package was routinely reviewed to ensure that personnel with comparable experience and job responsibilities were being equivalently underpaid. "Sex is simply not a determining factor in how we view our workers; they're all disposable quantities to us that deserve an identical amount of disrespect and lack of recognition. No exceptions." While noting that these gender-equal practices were unorthodox, Stargell added that the company was already seeing clear benefits to its bottom line.
