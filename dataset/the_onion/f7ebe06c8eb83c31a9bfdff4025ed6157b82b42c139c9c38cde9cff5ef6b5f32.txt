OXFORD, MS--Sensing that their colleague had suddenly moved up in the world, break room sources at Randall Elementary School reported Wednesday that fifth-grade teacher Patricia Adams--who was earlier spotted with a new set of chalk holders--must have come into some money recently. "Damn, looks like Patty's become something of a big spender--whoah, are those things metal?" said fellow teacher Melissa Schermer, noting that the brand-name Creativity Street accessories were way too pricey to afford on their modest salary. "Word on the street, too, is that she's now keeping a three-pack of the good staples in her desk. Which begs the question, is there something she's not telling us?" Cafeteria sources later reported that Madame Moneybags had developed a suspicious taste for Perrier.
