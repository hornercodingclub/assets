NEW YORK--After reaching the  3,000-career-hits milestone last week, Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter told reporters Monday that he felt a great sense of relief that he could once again go back to not hitting the ball. "Now that that's all over with, I can sit back, relax, let my average sink back down to just above .200, and watch everyone debate if I still belong in the starting lineup," Jeter said. "I really  don't feel any pressure to get on base for the rest of the season at all. It's nice." Jeter added that if he does happen to hit the ball, it will probably just be a weak groundout to the right side.
