COLUMBUS, OH--Based on his recent activity on Facebook, local man Arthur Gibson, 29, is reportedly under the impression that libertarian icon and former presidential candidate Ron Paul is still running for a major federal office of some kind, sources confirmed Tuesday. "In times such as these, we require an experienced leader who is willing to stand behind the courage of his convictions and do what is right for America, and that man is Ron Paul," Gibson wrote in just his latest post on the social networking site, seemingly unaware that the 77-year-old political theorist and former congressman is neither running for president nor in a position wherein he can directly affect public policy in any way. "[President Barack] Obama has had his chance, and yet he has consistently failed us at every turn. Well, no more. It's time for us to take back our country." Gibson's Facebook friends later confirmed that the staunch libertarian has held unfounded delusions about Paul's ability to play a role in the political process since as far back as 2008.
