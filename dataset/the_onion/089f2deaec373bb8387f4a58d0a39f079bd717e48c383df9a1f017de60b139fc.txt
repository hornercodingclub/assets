DALLAS--Despite suffering several bruised ribs during last weekend's 36-31 victory over the New York Giants, Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo told reporters Friday that the injury will in no way hinder his performance in an upcoming recital of Pyotr Tchaikovsky's . "I might not be 100 percent by the opening scene, but it shouldn't affect my pirouetting motion at all, or my ability to plie and hit a grand jete at full speed," said Romo, adding that while he has experienced some soreness in recent days, any discomfort will "absolutely not" diminish his role as Odette, Queen of the Swans. "Look, these things happen during ballet season. It's been feeling better during rehearsal, so I'll definitely be out there for all four acts this Saturday night. Sometimes you have to just dance through the pain, because at the end of the day, it's all about the ensemble." Romo did confirm, however, that he plans to wear a brace underneath his bodice to protect his ribcage while being lifted into the air.
