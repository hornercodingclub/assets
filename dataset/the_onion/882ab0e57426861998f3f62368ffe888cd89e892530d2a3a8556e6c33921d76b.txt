A judge has granted Kentucky's only remaining abortion clinic a temporary 14-day restraining order against Governor Matt Bevin, who is attempting to shutter the facility. What do think? "Seems like now's a good opportunity for some enterprising individual to go open up Kentucky's second abortion clinic." Leroy Diwald * Tuna Prepper "It's so unfair that Governor Bevin is being forced to keep something alive just because the law gives him no other option." Brad Covington * Pan Scraper "Ugh, I need an abortion, but the lines are going to be nuts." Bess Gowers * Malady Namer
