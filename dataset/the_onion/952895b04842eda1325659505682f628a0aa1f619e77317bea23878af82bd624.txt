What do think? "Interesting. Do you have any additional literature on this topic that I could pass out on the train?" Wendy Longeran * Cubist Landscaper "I've always suspected the field of mathematics was in on it." Chet Morse * Lunch Reviewer "True, although this study fails to point out that sunspots and satellite trajectories are also determining factors." David Doogan * Script Supervisor
