PORTLAND, OR--According to sources close to the injury-plagued Portland Trail Blazers, after a series of knee injuries to center Marcus Camby and All-Star guard Brandon Roy, the team is now officially down to one good knee. "Normally our strategy is to rest the knee so it can be ready for critical fourth-quarter situations, but right now we're letting LaMarcus Aldridge use it so he can be effective under the basket," head coach Nate McMillan told reporters, adding that he hopes the Blazers will continue their current winning streak so the knee can be saved for the playoffs. "Of course, Brandon will need the knee when he comes back, but to be honest, I'm worried that he'll just blow it out." McMillan added that he has a ton of working ACLs, MCLs, and a couple of good bursa sacs, but without multiple working knees, they're basically useless.
