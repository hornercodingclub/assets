NEW YORK--Little, Brown and Company announced Monday the forthcoming publication of , a collection of recipes from MLB's all-time strikeout leader that will include Down-the-Middle Meatballs, Slow-Cooked Pulled Fouls, Nolan's Famous Cheese Casserole, and more than 200 other "finger-licking" dishes made from regulation baseballs. "There's nothing better on a summer afternoon than throwing a few ground balls on the grill and cooking up some flame-broiled sliders," read an excerpt from the first-ballot Hall of Famer's cookbook, which will reportedly feature chapters on properly cutting a baseball, on techniques for dry and wet rubs, and on mixing the perfect screwball cocktail. "You're going to want to put a bat or two on your grill and shut the lid to really smoke them right in there. And be sure to put on your mitt when you take them out, because those baseballs are going to reach high heat." According to Ryan, the cookbook is a natural extension of his popular Fastballs Grille, which has been serving marinated, slow-roasted spitball kabobs at Rangers Ballpark since 2008.
