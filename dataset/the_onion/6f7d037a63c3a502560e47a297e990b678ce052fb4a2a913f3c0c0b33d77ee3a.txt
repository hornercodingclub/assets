ANACORTES, WA--Apologizing profusely throughout a gathering he was hosting at his home, local man Sam Kenrick was reportedly humiliated by his Wi-Fi's poor behavior in front of several guests Thursday evening. "Oh God, I'm so sorry; it never usually acts like this," said an embarrassed Kenrick, who tried unsuccessfully to get the system to respond to him before letting out an exasperated sigh when it began to repeatedly bother one of his guests. "I really don't know what's gotten into it. It was being so good right before you got here, I swear. It's probably because there are so many people. That must be it." Kenrick's guests reportedly looked on uncomfortably several moments later as their host verbally berated the misbehaving router before giving it a little slap.
