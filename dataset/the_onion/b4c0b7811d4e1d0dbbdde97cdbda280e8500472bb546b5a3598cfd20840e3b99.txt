WASHINGTON--In an effort to curb rising deer populations nationwide, the U.S. Department of the Interior introduced a new federal program Monday that will provide free condoms to all of the country's fawns. "While we're still pursuing a number of other methods to control the population, ensuring that condoms are available free of charge is an easy and effective way to reduce the risk of pregnancy for young deer," said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, explaining that fawns can discreetly take as many condoms with spermicidal lubricant as they need from large bowls that have been placed near streams, meadows, and thickets. "We are not just providing prophylactics throughout the forest for the benefit of bucks. This program also hopes to empower does by distributing emergency contraceptives in piles of soft twigs and lichen." According to sources, the program will be supplemented by circulating pamphlets that educate about the dangers of unprotected sex in areas where young deer tend to frolic.
