NEW YORK--After three controversy-filled weeks, the NFL finally reached a deal with its locked-out officials Thursday, sparking waves of excitement from fans longing to bitch and complain about non-replacement referees again. "It's about damn time, I was starting to wonder if I'd ever get the chance to call the regular refs a bunch of blind-as-fuck dipshits again," said Jets fan Herb Krzynski, adding that it "just hasn't felt the same" threatening to injure replacement officials in the parking lot after games. "Honestly, it was hurting the integrity of the game to have us terrorizing the family members of those replacement referees on Facebook. It's going to feel so much better doing that to the normal referees." When reached for comment, several of the replacement referees also expressed their excitement to return to officiating at high school and junior college games where they get bitched at by real fans instead of "drunk corporate pricks in $900 seats."
