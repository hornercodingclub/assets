NEW YORK--Sighing contentedly as the evening's stresses melted away, Donald Trump reportedly kicked back and relaxed after the first presidential debate Monday night by slipping into his nice, warm personal reality, sources confirmed. "Ahhh," said the GOP nominee in audible satisfaction as he eased his way into the pleasant universe of his own making, growing calmer and more comfortable as he submerged himself fully within the soothing world of facts, opinions, and personal adulation that exist solely to him alone. "Mmmmm, much better." According to sources, Trump then sat back with his eyes closed and a serene smile on his face as he allowed a refreshing rush of extremely positive reviews of his debate performance to wash over him.
