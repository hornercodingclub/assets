PITTSBURGH--On the heels of the Steelers' Super Bowl victory in February and the Penguins' Stanley Cup win last week, members of the fifth-place Pirates have asked the 320,000 residents of Pittsburgh to please stop giving them expectant, impatient looks. "Look, we know, okay? We know," Pirates shortstop Jack Wilson told reporters Wednesday, adding that staring really isn't necessary or even polite. "I can assure you it's not helping matters." Wilson said he looked forward to getting back for Tuesday's home game against the Indians, as PNC Park is the only place where the citizens of Pittsburgh leave the team alone.
