CARNOUSTIE, SCOTLAND--During the post-tournament press conference following his victory in this year's British Open, Ireland's Padraig Harrington said the whole experience of winning his first major championship failed to excite him and was, in the end, "rather boring." "This is, after all, a slow and tedious game," said Harrington, who said his four-hole playoff with Sergio Garcia was merely "the same old thing with, thankfully, fewer holes." "Hit the ball hard, approach it again, and hit it somewhat more softly. Sometimes one strikes it rather harder than necessary, sometimes less. Still, it's a living, isn't it?" When asked if he would defend his British Open title next year, a disinterested Harrington responded, "Yes, yes, whatever."
