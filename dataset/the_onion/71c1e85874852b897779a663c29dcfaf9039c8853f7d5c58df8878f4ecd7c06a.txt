NEW YORK--Following a no-decision after two consecutive losses--a three-game span in which the Mets scored a combined three runs--Tom Glavine (5-3) shook his head while repeatedly mumbling "It's never gonna happen" at a post-game press conference Tuesday. "Five 20-win seasons and two stupid Cy Young awards, so what? It means nothing... I have nothing," said a visibly dejected Glavine to a crowd that included his wife, daughter, and stepson. "I should have retired when I had the chance, but now I'll just end my career as a loser. God, I am such a loser." Mets pitcher Pedro Martinez tried to cheer up Glavine with by telling him that at least his career hasn't been marred by injuries, to which Glavine responded, "Shut up."
