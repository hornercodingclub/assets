DENVER--Praising the 39-year-old's exhaustive preparations amid accusations involving performance-enhancing drug use and sexual assault, sources close to Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning confirmed Wednesday that he has been tirelessly studying video footage of other athletes denying allegations. "He'll sit in his film room 10, sometimes 12 hours a day just studying various defenses, and he's been absolutely meticulous about writing down exactly how many seconds someone pauses before becoming teary-eyed and saying how hard the whole process has been on them and their family," said Manning's personal assistant, Ryan Robinson, noting that the quarterback had been thoroughly studying the likes of Kobe Bryant, Barry Bonds, Ben Roethlisberger, and Lance Armstrong, often rewatching their interviews multiple times until he has memorized the techniques they used to profess their innocence. "You can ask him where Roger Clemens' eyes were each time he says 'It never happened' on the interview about the Mitchell Report, and Peyton can tell you. I swear, he's got an encyclopedic knowledge of this stuff going back to the 1985 MLB cocaine trials. He's just so focused and determined to beat the case." Robinson added that Manning has also been meeting three hours a day with a public-speaking coach to work on the fundamentals of nonverbally conveying disbelief.
