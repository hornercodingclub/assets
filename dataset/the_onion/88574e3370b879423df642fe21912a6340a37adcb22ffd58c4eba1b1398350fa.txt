Watching a coach blow his cool is a treasured football tradition. Here are the ones that made press-conference history: 1960: Cowboys coach Tom Landry is fined $5,000 by the NFL for raising his voice during a postgame press conference 1986: The room falls silent after Bears coach Mike Ditka, offended by an antagonizing question, tells reporters, "I thought you guys were my best friends" 1996: Marty Schottenheimer passionately explains his most recent playoff loss without realizing he is reciting the lyrics to Queen's "Under Pressure" 2004: Following a tough AFC championship game loss, Colts coach Tony Dungy renounces Jesus Christ and sacrifices his first animal to almighty Satan 2004: Addressing the media for the first time as Giants coach, Tom Coughlin forces a New York Post writer, who fumbled a question, to stay after the press conference and practice his query until he gets it right 2005: Red-faced with emotion and grasping the mic in a white-knuckled grip, Steelers coach Bill Cowher nearly deafens reporters with his spittle-drenched roaring while praising his team, lauding the recent press coverage, and thanking his wife and three lovely daughters 2006: After an early playoff exit, Jack Del Rio makes a quick motion as if to punch the press, causing every reporter in the room to flinch 2006: After Arizona coach Dennis Green punctuates a disastrous Monday night loss to the Bears by flipping out and leaving his press conference early, the camera cuts to the gallery, where a flamboyantly gay man breaks the nervous silence by sarcastically quipping: "Well! That was interesting!"
