BALTIMORE--Following pitcher Jason Grimsley's allegation that Miguel Tejada had taken performance-enhancing drugs while the two were teammates, Tejada denied all knowledge of Grimsley, Rafael Palmeiro, anabolic steroids, Bud Selig, random drug tests, Jay Gibbons, Brian Roberts, the Orioles baseball organization, and the city of Baltimore. "Jason Grimsley? I've never heard of him before in my life. Who is he? Is he a movie star?" Tejada asked reporters Monday. "And what are steroids? People keep saying 'steroids,' but I have no idea what that term means. And who are these so-called 'Baltimore Orioles' he keeps mentioning? What is going on?" Tejada went on to claim that he cannot recall winning the 2002 AL MVP award, that he has definitely never played Major League Baseball, and that he doesn't know where he is right now and can't remember how he got here.
