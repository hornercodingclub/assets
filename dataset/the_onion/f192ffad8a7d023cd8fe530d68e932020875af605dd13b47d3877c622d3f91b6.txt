WASHINGTON--Expressing outrage that the network's moderators would stoop so low on a nationally televised town hall, Fox News pundits slammed CNN Friday for providing Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden each question seconds before he answered it. "Biden's responses to CNN's questions clearly show that he'd been tipped off as to what the question was going to be at least several seconds beforehand when it was being asked--how is that fair?" asked host Tucker Carlson, echoing the criticisms of several other conservative media outlets that Biden was given an unfair advantage by getting to hear the entire question before replying. "Seriously, I thought these people learned their lesson after what happened in 2016 with Hillary Clinton, but it's absolutely clear from the way Biden listens to their questions and responds that he had listened to their questions before responding. This is the kind of bias we have in the media right now. You know that if Donald Trump was at the town hall instead they would make him answer the question before it was asked." Fox News pundits additionally slammed CNN for unfairly  giving Biden's campaign advance notice about the town hall's format, location, and the fact that it was being nationally televised.
