HOUSTON--With Ray Lewis on injured reserve after suffering a torn triceps, Baltimore Ravens players and coaches confirmed Sunday that they were dreading the loud, outspoken linebacker's constant presence on the sideline for the rest of the season. "Oh, God, that's going to be so awful when he's around all the time," said Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, adding that it made him cringe to think of Lewis incessantly screaming criticism, support, and advice at everyone on the sideline. "Knowing Ray, he'll be shouting nonstop and never shut the hell up. I like it when he's on the field, because then you get a nice break from him." At press time, a group of Ravens players had reportedly gathered to pray for Ray Lewis to die.
