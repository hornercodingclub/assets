Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as New York governor in 2008 after admitting that he solicited call girls from a prostitution ring, confirmed this week that he is running for New York City comptroller, asking voters to forgive him for the scandal so he can return to public service. What do think? "Wow! As if comptroller elections weren't exciting enough to begin with." Jerry Rivas * Vat Tender "Yet another amoral politician who's willing to say and do anything in his monomaniacal pursuit of the comptrollership." Amary Downing * Bench Designer "What a stand-up thing to do. Hell, I respect him again already." Russ Llewelyn * Sales Assistant
