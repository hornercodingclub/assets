DENVER--Nuggets president Josh Kroenke announced Thursday that although the franchise has been in Denver since 1967, the organization would be willing to move to New York City for star forward Carmelo Anthony if that's what it takes to keep him on the team. "It's important for him to know that we're committed to this relationship," Kroenke said at a press conference, adding that the team would try to find a small, cheap arena in Queens and see how things went from there. "Other than Carmelo and his basketball, the truth of the matter is we didn't have much keeping us in Denver. So maybe this will be a good change. Like we said when we first signed him in 2003: together forever." At press time, Kroenke assured Anthony that, were the move to happen, the Nuggets would be fine with "doing their own thing" and not spending every minute together.
