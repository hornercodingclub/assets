NEW YORK--Continuing a high-spending offseason that has seen the team sign free agents CC Sabathia, A.J. Burnett, and Mark Teixeira to lucrative contracts, the New York Yankees dipped into their pocketbook once again to sign Alex Rodriguez to another 10-year, $275 million deal. "This contract will run concurrent to the 10-year, $275 million contract we signed with Alex last winter," said Yanks' GM Brian Cashman, who announced that the deal includes the option for yet another 7-year, $175 million deal. "This gives us some more flexibility in the 2018 season. We hit a stumbling block when [agent] Scott [Boras] insisted we reinstitute the last three years of the deal Alex opted out of, but then we decided to just throw $75 million in there. Alex is a great player, and we think his new contract will be a great addition to our payroll." Reports indicate the Yankees have entered negotiations to once again sign Derek Jeter, CC Sabathia, and Alex Rodriguez.
