SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA--While attending the first session of Women's Kickboxing Boot Camp at a local fitness center Monday evening, area woman Laurie Woods told reporters she could already tell she'd be whining in the morning about how sore she is. "After this many cardio intervals, you can bet I'll be complaining out loud to friends and acquaintances about my muscle stiffness as soon as I get up," said the 32-year-old brand manager, adding that with all the power squats she's doing, there's no way she won't be carrying on about her aching quads when she sits down at her desk tomorrow and throughout the remainder of the workday. "Thank God it was only a 30-minute intro session and not a full hour, otherwise I know I'd be audibly wincing from the pain every time I walked past one of my coworkers' cubicles until they asked me what was wrong. Still, I can tell it's going to be a pretty tough morning full of griping over how much it hurts to do almost anything." Upon finishing her class and leaving the the gym, Woods said she could already feel specific complaints about her sore back and shoulders formulating in her mind.
