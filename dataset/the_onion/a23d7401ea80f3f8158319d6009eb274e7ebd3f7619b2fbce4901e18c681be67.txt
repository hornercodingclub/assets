NEW YORK--Following the first half of Thursday's Sweet 16 matchup between the University of Dayton and Stanford University, sources confirmed that college basketball commentator Charles Barkley was observed blatantly gambling on the outcome of NCAA Tournament games throughout the CBS halftime report. "Hey, Red, lemme get 20 large on UCLA with the points, and a dime on San Diego straight up, okay?" the retired NBA star said in a cell phone conversation as cameras rolled in CBS' broadcast studio, moments after having told a previous caller, "You don't need to do that; I'm good for it, I swear." "Man, these kids better get their act together, or I'm going to take a big hit. Good thing Baylor's a lock against Wisconsin, otherwise I'd be in huge trouble. Hey, who you got in the Louisville game, Ernie?" According to viewers, Barkley then added that he was excited to collect on his numerous wagers, as the winnings represented "some prime blow job money."
