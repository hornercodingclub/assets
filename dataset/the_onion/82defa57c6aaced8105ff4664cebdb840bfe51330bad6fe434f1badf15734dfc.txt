ST. PAUL, MN--Local resident Nathan Erdlich's night out was reportedly thrown completely off-balance Wednesday when his friend unexpectedly brought someone to join them for drinks, sources confirmed. "Um, hey, how's it going?" Erdlich, 29, said to the unforeseen additional person, whom he had never met and whose presence compelled Erdlich and his friend to limit their conversation to broad, mundane topics all three could participate in. "So, you work near Brian? Same building, huh? Cool. Yeah, we used to be roommates." An hour into the evening, Erdlich reportedly looked on in disbelief as the unanticipated stranger gestured to two additional people entering the bar.
