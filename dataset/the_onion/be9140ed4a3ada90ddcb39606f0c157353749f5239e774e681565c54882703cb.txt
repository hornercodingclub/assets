WASHINGTON--Just two months after the close of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the nation's love affair with gold-medal-winning gymnast McKayla Maroney came to an abrupt end Tuesday after Americans discovered she is only 16 years old. "Whoa," 31-year-old Greg Adamko said upon learning that Maroney was born in 1995, adding that he "totally thought she was at least 19." "I mean, it's not like I ever--Jesus Christ, 16? Are you sure? Shit." At press time, sources confirmed that citizens across the country were quickly deleting their Internet histories.
