What do think? "What's the big deal? It's like you've never been beaten up by missionaries before." Willy Vonn * Faucet Assembler "As a resident of the Southwest, I can attest that Mormons are very friendly, hard-working, community-minded people. I've been creeped out by them maybe eight, nine times tops." Dustin Filley * Sisal Picker "Are you trying to convert me to Mormonism right now? Because it's working."
