MIAMI--Miami Marlins catcher John Buck was reportedly "totally humiliated" during the fifth inning of Tuesday's game against the New York Mets after completely forgetting the reason why he walked to the pitcher's mound. "Just give me a second here, it'll come to me," Buck was overheard saying before crossing his arms and staring silently into into the distance for several moments. "Something about the runner on second, maybe? Shit, I have no idea. Well, I'll let you know if I remember what it was, I guess." Team sources confirmed that Buck immediately recalled what he meant to say as soon as Hudson gave up a home run from an inside fastball on the next pitch.
