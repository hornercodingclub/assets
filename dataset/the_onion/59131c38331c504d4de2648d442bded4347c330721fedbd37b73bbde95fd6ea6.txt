MIAMI--Second-year quarterback Ryan Tannehill expressed his confidence in the Dolphins after minicamp Tuesday, claiming that he believes this team could win almost any number of games next year. "With the talent on this squad, I'm quite optimistic that we could definitely win anywhere from one to eight games this season," said Tannehill. "It may sound crazy in June, but a zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven-win season isn't out of the realm of possibility this year." Tannehill also told reporters that he believed the Dolphins had it in them to put together a fairly solid losing streak.
