ST. PAUL, MN--Complaining that the officials need to learn the damn rules, 44-year-old local dad Mark Bogdanski expressed both doubt and frustration Sunday over where the referee spotted the football. "They gave him a whole extra yard there--what are these refs even looking at?" said Bogdanski, adding that the referees are pretty much gifting the other team a first down with such a generous spot. "Don't give me that bull about forward progress either, because his knee was down almost a full yard back. You have to challenge that call--that should be fourth down." At press time, Bogdanski was angrily muttering under his breath after officials had upheld the ruling on the field upon reviewing the play.
