LOS ANGELES--During an announcement that she was pregnant with the couple's first child, Danielle Jonas confirmed Wednesday that she was still not entirely sure which of the Jonas Brothers she had married. "The one with the curly hair...that's Joe, right? Or is it Nick?" said the 25-year-old, who wondered aloud if she had possibly wed "Kellen" [sic] Jonas in 2009. "Honestly, I don't know. When all three of them are together, I can't really tell them apart, but I'm definitely having a baby with one of them." At press time, a still unsure Danielle Jonas told reporters she would ask her 10-year-old niece because "she's really into the Jonas Brothers."
