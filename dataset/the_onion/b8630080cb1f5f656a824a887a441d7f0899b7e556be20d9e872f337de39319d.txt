NEW YORK--As part of its comprehensive professional football coverage in anticipation of the upcoming season, sports news site published an article Tuesday ranking all 128 NFL teams. "From the best in the game, all the way down to the bottom of the barrel, we're analyzing each and every one of the 128 professional footballs teams in all 32 divisions," featured columnist Ryan Wooden wrote in the introduction to the slideshow, which reportedly includes two slides for each team--one explaining its ranking and one simply displaying the team's name. "We took an extensive look at every squad in the league and identified the teams to beat in the NFC, AFC, EFC, and RFC conferences. Be sure to check back next week, when we're going to be rolling out a series of slideshows taking a look at every single matchup for all 42 weeks of the regular season." According to sources, the slideshow was the site's most viewed article since last month's list of the NFL's top 500 tacklebacks.
