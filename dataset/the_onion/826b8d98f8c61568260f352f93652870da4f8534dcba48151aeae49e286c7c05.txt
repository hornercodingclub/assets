ST. LOUIS--Results from an MRI scan of Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina's right knee revealed a "super gross" mess of blood, cartilage, and tendons inside the joint, concerned radiologists confirmed Thursday. "Yadier's knee appears to be full of all this nasty, slimy stuff that totally makes you want to puke," said Saint Louis University's Dr. Joseph Farber, adding that there are a bunch of nasty worm-like things everywhere in the "completely disgusting" knee. "It's all wet and greasy, too, almost like ground beef or brains. Ugh, I don't even want to look at it, let alone touch it." Farber added that Molina should avoid putting any weight on the knee, warning that doing so would "probably cause it to fall apart or explode or something."
