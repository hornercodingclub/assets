BATON ROUGE, LA--In town with for a matchup between No. 1 Alabama and No. 15 LSU, 72-year-old Lee Corso felt awkward as he was surrounded by college students for the first time in his life during a rally thrown by a local fraternity. "God, look at them; they're so young," observed Corso, clutching a red plastic Solo cup filled with Coors Light while huddled in a crowded basement corner with cohosts Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit. "I saw a group of girls come in here that, I swear to God, they looked like they were 13 years old. I mean, they're acting nice enough, taking pictures with me and everything, but come on." Finally unable to bear it any longer, Corso retired to the bus and fell asleep while reading his book.
