For the first time in their 31-year history, American Girl is releasing a male "American Boy" doll named Logan Everett, a drummer from Nashville. What do think? "No child of mine is going to play with a doll from Nashville." Judy Eliot * Avocado Pitter "I just hope this new doll continues the proud American Girl tradition of being cost prohibitive for most families." Blake Gorland * Boat Christener "It'll be nice to have a male doll instructing me to kill my loved ones for a change." Larry Crouch * Canister Filler
