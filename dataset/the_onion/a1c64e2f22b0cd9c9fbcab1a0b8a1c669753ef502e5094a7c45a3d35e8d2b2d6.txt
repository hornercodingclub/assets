WASHINGTON--Telling the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had no choice because saying anything else would be incredibly stupid, Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner testified Monday that he did not collude with Russia during the campaign, but pretty much had to say that. "I did not in any way conspire or collaborate with any foreign government, but even if I did, I wouldn't tell you because I would likely go to jail," said Kushner, adding that if he had to choose between lying to a panel of legislators--plenty of whom were happy to take his excuses at face value--or openly admitting to being a criminal, he'd lie every single time. "At this point, with no real pressure to admit I committed a felony or participated in any illegal activity whatsoever, I suppose I'll just keep saying I did nothing wrong. Honestly, the only smart move here is to stand up and say the one thing that doesn't destroy my life, so I'll be sticking with that for the time being." Kushner went on to say that he had no knowledge of collusion on the part of anyone else involved with the Trump campaign because, come on, what would you say if you were him?
