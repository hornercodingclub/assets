NEW ORLEANS--After Reggie Bush's first touchdown as a professional football player--a 65-yard punt return that ultimately allowed the New Orleans Saints to defeat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24-21--the rookie running back said he didn't know what he was expecting, but "this just wasn't it." "I don't know what I thought would happen, you know? Game-winning touchdown in the NFL, my first TD as a pro, I just hoped that... I don't even know anymore," said Bush at a post-game press conference, adding that perhaps "things felt off" because at USC over 20,000 more people cheered when he scored. "Maybe [NFL touchdowns] get better the more you get them. I sure hope so." When asked what he planned to do with the game ball, Bush said he was considering giving it to a young child, but didn't want to ruin football for him at such an early age.
