BOURBONNAIS, IL--Shrugging his shoulders and scowling, Bears quarterback Jay Cutler told reporters Tuesday that he's looking forward to proving doubters "completely whatever" in the final year of his contract. "People want to question my future with this team, and that just motivates me to show them meh," said Cutler, holding his mouth agape for several seconds before continuing. "I know there's a lot of pressure on me to win, so at the end of the day I just have to go out there and who gives a shit." Sources confirmed Cutler concluded the press conference by putting on a large winter jacket, silently pouting, and refusing to answer any questions from reporters.
