WASHINGTON--Expressing regret over its reckless decision to infect the Democratic presidential nominee, the virus causing Hillary Clinton's pneumonia was reportedly terrified Monday after remembering what the Clintons were capable of. "Oh shit, what the hell was I thinking--you don't get on the wrong side of these people," said the infectious agent, which became increasingly worried while recalling just how far the Clintons were willing to go to get what they wanted, as well as what often happened to those who dared to cross the powerful politicians. "Everybody knows you never mess with the Clintons. These people won't hesitate to absolutely crush you, and they have the money and connections to do it. I knew I should've just stayed clear. I'm so fucked." At press time, the horrified virus was reportedly planning to avoid the Clintons' wrath by taking its own life.
