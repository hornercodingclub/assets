NEW YORK--Admitting that the previous incarnation of its program may have set unrealistically high expectations for the nation's youth, the NFL unveiled Thursday its newly downscaled "Play 60" campaign, in which the league is encouraging children to be physically active for 60 seconds per week. "In hindsight, hoping that kids would be able to get out there and move around for an entire hour every single day was wildly optimistic, but we're hoping that a solid minute of motion every week or so is a bit more attainable," NFL spokesperson Clare Graff said of the more reasonable health and fitness campaign, which urges children to make an effort to engage in such activities as standing, waddling, and holding a "semi-vertical" pose to whatever extent they are capable. "And keep in mind that those 60 seconds don't all have to come at once. No need to overdo it. You can split it up into five- or 10-second chunks, and you don't have to start with a full minute at first. Just, you know, try your best." Graff added that in an effort to spread word about the revised exercise program, the NFL is planning on airing a new Play 60 commercial featuring a group of panting, red-faced children shifting around on a couch with Green Bay Packers defensive tackle B.J. Raji.
