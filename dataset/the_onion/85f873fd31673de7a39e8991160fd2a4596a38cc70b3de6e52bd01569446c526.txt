NEW YORK--Law enforcement specialists who responded to reports of a ticking draft timer at Radio City Music Hall Thursday night are being praised for their selflessness and courage in preventing the clock from counting down its final second. "If that thing had been allowed to hit zero, these guys would have been sent flying all over the country," said SWAT team disposal technician Gavin McReary, the man who actually cut the wires that stopped the clock, preventing a tragedy that would have ruined the lives of countless young men. "You should have seen the look of relief on that Suh guy's face. He hugged me and said if we hadn't been there to deactivate that timing device, his life would be over." To show their gratitude, college football stars posed with the officers while wearing NYPD caps and holding up commemorative 00:01 SWAT uniforms.
