CHICAGO--After remarking upon the frigid temperatures and blustery conditions during his walk into work this morning, Michael Halloran, an adjunct professor of communications and media studies, expressed hope Wednesday that one of his students would leave behind a pair of warm gloves. "It'd be great if someone accidentally dropped a couple of nice, thick gloves on their way out of the classroom or just forgot about them on the corner of their desk," the 41-year-old Ph.D. said after hurrying across a chilly campus to teach his third course of the day, noting that last month someone left behind an umbrella that "really helped [him] out." "Wool would be great, or Gore-Tex maybe, though really I'd be happy with anything. I'm not picky. A mismatched pair would be fine, too. I'd even take one glove if that's all there was. Maybe I could use the hand with the glove to carry my bag and keep the bare hand in my pocket." At press time, sources reported that the adjunct professor had hit the jackpot when he came across a scarf under a chair.
