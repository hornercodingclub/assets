WASHINGTON--Lauding President Trump for his invaluable role in the operation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller informed the public Wednesday that his so-called Russia investigation was in fact merely a cover for an elaborate sting to bring down the Clinton family's child sex-slavery ring. "The Justice Department has finally been able to track down and arrest everyone associated with the Clinton Foundation's unconscionable crimes, and it's all thanks to President Trump agreeing to work undercover and play along with our fabricated accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 election," said Mueller, explaining that after its agent Seth Rich was killed by the Clintons, the department recruited Trump to distract high-ranking Democrats with social media stunts, continuous denials of Russian involvement in U.S. politics, and glowing praise for Vladimir Putin. "Without the president's help, we never would have been able to keep the guise of the 'Russia investigation' going long enough to launch our successful raids of Comet Ping Pong and secret locations in Haiti--efforts that ultimately brought the Clintons' human-trafficking crimes to light. Thanks to the heroic actions of Donald Trump, we can all sleep a little more soundly tonight, knowing the world's children are safe." Mueller went on to thank the numerous media personalities and Republican lawmakers who first pointed out to federal investigators that the real problem lay in Hillary Clinton's missing emails.
