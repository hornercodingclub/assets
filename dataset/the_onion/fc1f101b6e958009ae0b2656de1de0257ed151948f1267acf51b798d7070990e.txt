--According to sources, a piece appearing in this month's issue of magazine about actress, comedian, and author Mindy Kaling does not once mention that she is a woman. Along with never remarking upon Kaling's gender, the 850-word article fails to bring up Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Chelsea Handler, Whitney Cummings, Lena Dunham, Adam Carolla, or the 2011 film , and at no point makes use of the phrase "women in comedy" or "funniest ladies on TV." Sources said the piece also neglects to observe that Kaling's profession is predominantly made up of white males, and fails to further note that Kaling is not only a woman, but a woman of Indian descent. At press time, Mindy Kaling is a woman in comedy.
