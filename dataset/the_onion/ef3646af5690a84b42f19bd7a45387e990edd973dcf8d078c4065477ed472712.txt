What do think? "I don't need a scientific study to tell me that I can drink 800 Dutch students under the table." Grady McGowan * Systems Analyst "Looks like we just have to accept that there is no way to not wake up hungover." Russell Colvin * Papal Understudy "It's true. There really is no substitute for six raw eggs, diced shallots, Pedialyte, and a shot of insulin." Morgan Klein * Head Librarian
