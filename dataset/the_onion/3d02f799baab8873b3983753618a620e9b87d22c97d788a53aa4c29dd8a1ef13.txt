LOS ANGELES--In an effort to provide personalized feedback so that all Oscar nominees can strengthen their performance habits and ensure future awards success, members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences confirmed this week that they will issue in-depth progress reports to each of this year's runners-up. "Every nominee who does not win in his or her category can expect to sit down with Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs for a 20-minute one-on-one to go over a three- to four-page summary of their specific dramatic strengths as well as some areas that require improvement," said AMPAS public relations representative Rob Friedman, who added that the Academy would take all facets of an actor's performance into consideration when compiling the assessments, including effort, range, and dialogue delivery, each of which would be evaluated on a standardized five-point scale. "Detailed, constructive evaluations are key to helping nominees develop the skills they need to thrive during the competitive awards season, and we hope that this new service will help take some of the guesswork out of what is expected of them and equip them to succeed going forward." To help reinforce the reports' recommendations, Friedman said that each runner-up would be required to write up a brief summary of their acting goals for the upcoming year and develop an actionable plan to achieve those goals.
