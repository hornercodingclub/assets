LOS ANGELES--Asked for his thoughts on his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, Leonardo DiCaprio told reporters Thursday that he really hopes he screamed and cried good enough in to win the Oscar. "I yelled really loud in this movie when I was angry and I started crying hard after I got upset, so hopefully the guys who choose the winners saw all that and liked it," said DiCaprio, who expressed optimism that his chances will be further bolstered by the fact that, in addition to stumbling and falling a bunch of times in the snow, there were some scenes where he shouted so loud it made his throat hurt, and sometimes spittle even came out of his mouth and got trapped in the big, gross beard he grew. "I bet my chances are good because this is the most I've ever screamed and cried--way more than I did in or . Plus my nose was dripping a lot but I didn't even wipe it; I just left it there." DiCaprio then admitted that he is still somewhat nervous that he did a bad job during the parts where he sits quietly and looks at something far away.
