KANSAS CITY--After the seventh-inning stretch of Tuesday night's MLB All-Star game, Boston Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz spoke to several members of the Kauffman Stadium grounds crew requesting they turn off all the lights, as the evening had grown dark enough for both teams to see all the stars they were brought there to see. "All these bright lights scare the stars away, but this is the game where we're supposed to see them all, so we need to turn off the lights to help them come out," said Ortiz, adding that he hoped the stars in Kansas City would be as good as the ones he saw in Arizona last year. "I keep getting invited back because I know all the shapes the stars make, like the big baseball bat and the 'W' and the triangle and the one that looks like home plate if it was kind of shorter in one part." After several crew members, umpires, and teammates informed Ortiz that the lights would in fact not be turned off, the Boston slugger refused to move from the AL bench or speak to anybody about the game unless they called it the "No-Star Game."
