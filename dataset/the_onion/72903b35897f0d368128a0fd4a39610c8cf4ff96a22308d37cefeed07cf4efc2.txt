NEW YORK--Citing a responsibility to honor coworkers lost on Sept. 11, 2001, Continental Sports Channel managing editor and former executive producer Dana Whitaker announced that a memorial service would be held Sunday near the show's former World Trade Center office. "When the first plane hit, instantly killing Dan [Rydell] and Casey [McCall], the show and our lives changed forever," said Whitaker, adding that the memorial would especially be cathartic for the show's current executive producer, Natalie Hurley-Goodwin, who lost her husband Jeremy when the studio's editing bay was engulfed in flames. "So many members of the CSC family are now gone: the entire crew; [CSC ratings adviser] Sam [Donovan], who was actually on one of the planes; and Sally Sasser who, even though she wanted my job and slept with Casey, did put on a very polished . And poor Isaac. With the complications he was suffering as a result of his stroke, he never had a chance of making it out." Whitaker added that she is still having trouble finding the right balance between her personal and professional life.
