LITTLE ROCK, AR--Reading the signs written in the world around him to divine the course of events as yet unfolded, wise local oracle Phillip McKenna foresaw the arrival of ill weather at a neighborhood barbecue Monday and uttered a sharp warning to those gathered, eyewitnesses said. "Uh-oh. I just felt a raindrop, guys," the sage prognosticator declared to all, holding aloft his dampened wrist as testimony to his omen as he gazed into the heavens and interpreted its silent teachings. "It's looking pretty gray. Maybe we ought to get the food inside?" At last report, the discovery of condensation falling from an air conditioner had unmasked McKenna as a false prophet.
