ST. PAUL, MN--In an effort to spur their local economies, many state governments are now offering tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks to any person who simply says the words "high-tech jobs," according to a survey by the Pew Research Center published Monday. "We must do what it takes to draw potential innovators to the great state of Minnesota, which means granting lucrative tax credits and loan guarantees to any individual--whoever they may be--who utters the phrase 'high-tech jobs' in any context whatsoever," said Minnesota governor Mark Dayton, whose office has reportedly joined numerous other states in doling out tax exclusions, low-interest municipal loans, full income tax exemption for 10 years or more, and other valuable incentives to thousands of people who have spoken such phrases as "biotech," "innovation center," "high-skilled workers," and "tomorrow's economy." "Anyone who can say those words will get all the taxpayer-financed assistance they want, no questions asked. We can also provide tax-free property and generous relocation packages to anyone who recites the phrase 'regional technology hub.' Heck, we'll raze a nice big plot of land for you in any city in the state at your request. Seriously, we'll do whatever you want--don't be afraid to ask." Economic experts told reporters that the new incentive programs aim to replicate the success achieved by the municipalities of California's Silicon Valley, which in the 1970s established the area as the world's technological epicenter by offering production subsidies to anyone who mentioned the word "computer."
