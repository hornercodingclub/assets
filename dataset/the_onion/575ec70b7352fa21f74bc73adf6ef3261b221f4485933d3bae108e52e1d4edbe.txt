NEW YORK--Emphasizing that the practice was just more evidence of journalists' bias against him, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stated Thursday that he was sick and tired of the mainstream media always attempting to place his words into some kind of context. "The corrupt news media is constantly taking the things I say and putting them within the larger context of politics and global events--it's absolutely sickening what they do," said Trump, adding that many of the comments he has made--including his call yesterday for Russia to hack into the emails of his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton and publish the contents--had been repeatedly and unfairly contextualized with relevant facts about the world and pertinent information about the situation in which they were stated. "It's completely shameful to take words I've spoken or written and try to connect them to some kind of objective reality. I say something, and the next thing I know, a crooked reporter is telling everyone what I said along with a fact-based explanation of what its implications are and why it matters. It's ridiculous, and it has to stop." Trump added that he would not hesitate to ban any news organization from his campaign that continued to twist his statements by implying they held any specific meaning about or relation to the world we inhabit.
