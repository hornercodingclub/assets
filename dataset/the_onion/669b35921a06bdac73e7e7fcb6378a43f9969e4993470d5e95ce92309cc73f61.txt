NEW YORK--A joint report from all professional and amateur sporting leagues unanimously confirmed Thursday that fans enjoy waving random things around, typically above their heads, while attending athletic events. "Shirts, signs, their arms, any color of towel--basically we found that if a fan has the ability to hold something in his or her hand, there's a good chance he'll wave it around," Gina Keller, a representative of Major League Baseball, told reporters. "Our findings indicate that fans believe waving things around when their team is winning builds momentum, and waving things around when their team is losing motivates players to attempt comebacks. In short, fans like waving things." Keller added that a new report, expected to be released this December, should confirm that outcomes of sporting events would be the same if fans cheered loudly during games or just sat in absolute silence.
