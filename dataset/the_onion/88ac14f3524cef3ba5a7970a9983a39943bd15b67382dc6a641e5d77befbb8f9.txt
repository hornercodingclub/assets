NEW ORLEANS--Following this year's BCS National Championship game, held in New Orleans' Louisiana Superdome, commissioners from all amateur and professional sporting leagues released a statement Tuesday saying that sports is "through" helping the city of New Orleans recover from the devastation suffered at the hands of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. "We worked endless hours to make sure the Superdome was rebuilt in time for the Saints' home opener in 2006; we fought tirelessly to bring the 2008 NBA All-Star Game to the city; and long days and nights were spent making sure the Hornets were able to play in New Orleans Arena this year. Not to mention that our athletes have collectively worked thousands of hours helping the community rebuild," the statement read in part. "Enough's enough already. The city needs to start leeching off another industry." The statement added that sports will continue its pledge to aid New York City's recovery from the blackout of 1977, as the metropolis will add three new baseball teams, two more basketball teams, and four new athletic arenas by the end of 2012.
