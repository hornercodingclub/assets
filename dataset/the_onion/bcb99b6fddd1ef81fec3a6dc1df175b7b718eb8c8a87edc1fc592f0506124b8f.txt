MEQUON, WI--In anticipation of Sunday's conference championship games, retired college coach Jack Harbaugh told reporters that he is rooting for Tom Brady to lead the New England Patriots to another Super Bowl victory, saying the veteran quarterback deserves a fourth ring. "Of everyone playing the game right now, Brady ought to to take home the big win, because he's a great guy, a great competitor, and it would be awesome to see him rack up another title while he's still got it," said the former Western Kentucky Hilltoppers head coach, father of three, who pointed to Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons as the only other remaining quarterback who deserves to make the Super Bowl. "It would have been amazing to see another classic Brady-[Peyton] Manning AFC matchup, but now that the Broncos are out, I don't see who's going to stop the Patriots from going all the way. Anyone standing between them and that trophy better watch out." Harbaugh, who went on to praise the Patriots' Bill Belichick as "the best in the league" and "my kind of coach," expressed disappointment that the formidable gridiron tactician wouldn't face much in the way of competition en route to securing yet another championship.
