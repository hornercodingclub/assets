WASHINGTON--Overcome by the touching contribution, Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) was reportedly moved to tears Friday after reading a constituent's heartfelt check. "It's hard not to get choked up when someone takes the time to actually pick up a pen and write out such a sincere contribution by hand," said Blunt, adding that he had been particularly affected by the amount of the check, which he had reread several times. "Having spent a decade and a half in Washington, it's so gratifying to know that you're still reaching the people you were elected to represent back home. I'll cherish this forever." At press time, Blunt had written back to his constituent to express how much the check had meant and urged him to write again anytime he wanted.
