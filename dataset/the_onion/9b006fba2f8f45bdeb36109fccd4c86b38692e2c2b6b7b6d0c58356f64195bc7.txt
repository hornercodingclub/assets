AUSTIN, TX--Marking the end of the nearly four-hour televised event, Super Bowl party attendees confirmed Sunday that it is now the part of the night where everyone just sort of goes around and remembers which commercials they liked. "I loved the one with the celebrities who showed up as their most memorable characters," said party guest Andrew Duran, while other attendees shared catchphrases from spots and voiced their support for the commercial "with those big horses." "Of course, I'll always have a soft spot for the silly one with the former athlete, but the sentimental truck commercial with the dad was probably a close second. Oh, and that chip commercial for Pringles or Doritos or something was pretty good." This portion of the evening was immediately followed by a long, sad silence before the guests pulled out their phones and ordered cars to take them home.
