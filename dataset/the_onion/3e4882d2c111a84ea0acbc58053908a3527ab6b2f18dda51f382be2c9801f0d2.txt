JACKSONVILLE, FL--The only post on JagsBoard, a dedicated Jacksonville Jaguars fan page on which even spambots have not bothered to post, is an unanswered question from 2003 asking for help getting to the team's stadium, sources confirmed Monday. "Can i just take 95 all the way down to Alltel Stadium or do i need to get off on the mlk parkway at some point?" wrote IBleedTeal, whose profile features a Mark Brunell quote and whose message board avatar image is the team helmet. "i know the Dolphins are beating up on the whole league but i wanna see Leftwich's first start in person." The writer of the post went on to explain he had extra tickets located in a luxury box suite at midfield that were free to anyone who wanted them.
