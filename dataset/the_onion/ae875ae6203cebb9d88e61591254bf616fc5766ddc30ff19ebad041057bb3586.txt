NEW YORK--Former pitcher and current blogger, micro-blogger, commentator, and would-be gadfly Curt Schilling delivered his opinion on the A-Rod steroid situation Monday despite never having been asked to do so. "If his name is revealed, identify all 104 people who failed drug tests in 2003," said Schilling, who has opinions just like anyone else but evidently feels that his must be constantly shared with the world. Schilling reportedly spent the next several hours perusing the Internet to see if anyone had made a comment about him to which he should respond; finding none, Schilling played five hours of video games without a shirt on.
