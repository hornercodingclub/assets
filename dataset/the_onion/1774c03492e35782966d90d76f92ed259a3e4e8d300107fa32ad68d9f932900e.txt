NEW ORLEANS--Saying that he was just being honest, New Orleans guard Chris Paul told reporters Monday that Hornets fans are the 16th best fans on the planet. "Look at it this way: 16th is pretty darn good if we're talking about the whole world," said Paul, adding that the planet's greatest fans are clearly those of Manchester United in the British Premier League. "I could go and say something silly like Hornets fans are the best, but let's be real here. Teams like the Packers, Cubs, Michigan Wolverines, and Team Canada Hockey all have amazing fans, the 5th, 8th, 10th, and 6th best, respectively. I will say that Hornets fans are the 3rd best in the NBA's Southwest Division, which is still pretty decent." Paul added that, in the interest of full disclosure, he had to admit the Hornets would probably not bring home an NBA Championship within the next 10 years, although he himself would do so as part of the New York Knicks.
