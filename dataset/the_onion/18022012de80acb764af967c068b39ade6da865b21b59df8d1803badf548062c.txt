The nominees for the 70th annual Tony Awards were announced Tuesday, in which hit musical Hamilton swept the categories with 16 nominations, breaking the previous records set by The Producers and Billy Elliot in 2001 and 2009, respectively. What do think? "It's encouraging to know that even if you lose a duel, things could turn out okay for you 212 years later." Fred Tipton * Vent Investigator "That's great news. If Hamilton stays this popular, we won't have to hear about another musical for months!" Alice Bender * Banister Smoother "I always knew the American Theatre Wing was full of closet monarchists."
