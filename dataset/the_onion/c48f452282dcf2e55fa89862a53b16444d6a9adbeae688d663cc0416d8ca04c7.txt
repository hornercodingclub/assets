WASHINGTON--Claiming that such incidents can "really mess with your head if you're not careful," Federal Aviation Administration officials on Monday urged Lee Kang-kook, the Asiana Airlines pilot who crash-landed a commercial airliner at San Francisco International Airport last weekend, to get back out there and start flying again. "The more you dwell on this one crash, the more you'll start second-guessing yourself, so the best thing to do right now is to just put last Saturday behind you, get back into the cockpit, and find your wings again, bud," FAA head Michael Huerta told Kang-kook, stressing that for the sake of his confidence, right now would be "the absolute worst time to quit." "You think every pilot is perfect at flying these Boeing 777s right away? You just have to accept that these crashes are part and parcel of the learning process and not let one bad landing get in your head. You'll only get better with more practice. After all, how are you ever going to get better if you quit now, ya big goof?" Huerta added that it would be "a real shame" for Kang-kook to give up now, since he is still only 11 flights away from getting his license to fly 777 aircrafts.
