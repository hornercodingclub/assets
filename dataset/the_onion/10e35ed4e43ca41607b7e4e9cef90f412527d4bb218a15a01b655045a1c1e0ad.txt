URBANA, IL--The No. 3 Web Gem of the Day, Blue Jays third baseman Jose Bautista's backhand pickup of an Evan Longoria grounder, was a "great disappointment" to avid baseball fan Andrew Missel, who questioned whether the play deserved any honor at all. "So, what--he just short-hopped the ball?" asked Missel, who has often expressed deep dissatisfaction with the rankings and nominations of the segment. "It's an okay play, I guess, but Web Gem material? Christ, the No. 5 Web Gem was better than that, and it wasn't even that amazing either. At least [Brewers outfielder Mike] Cameron had to run for the ball. This is a travesty." Missel went on to critique the pitch selection in the program's "That's Nasty!" segment, announcing to an empty living room that Roy Oswalt's pitch was nothing more than a hanging slider.
