Police responded to reports yesterday that Justin Bieber threatened and attacked his neighbor after the latter voiced concerns that the 19-year-old pop star had been unsafely speeding through the neighborhood while testing out a newly delivered Ferrari. What do think? "Wow. I can't believe a kid who's received that much attention all his life could act so spoiled." Gustavo Sparado * Fish Seller "Can't the neighbor just be cool and think back to when he was 19 and was delivered Ferraris?" Jim Kressel * Optical Engineer "Well, how did the car drive?" Lucy Hartung * Systems Analyst
