NORTH ATTLEBORO, MA--Growing increasingly wary as he walked by several empty storefronts and a cluster of nonfunctional coin-operated rides, local insurance broker David Houghton reportedly had taken a wrong turn at Garden City Shopping Center Wednesday and ended up on the poor side of the mall. "This doesn't seem right," said Houghton, struggling to get his bearings as he passed a virtually empty independent toy and hobby shop, a Payless ShoeSource, and a wig shop with no apparent signage. "Where the hell am I?" After catching sight of an unattended airbrushing kiosk, a visibly shaken Houghton reportedly decided to turn around and retrace his steps back to Auntie Anne's.
