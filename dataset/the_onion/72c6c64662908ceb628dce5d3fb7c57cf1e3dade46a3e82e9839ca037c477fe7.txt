LEXINGTON, KY--Following a pedestrian stop Monday night during which they fired their weapons on a suspicious individual, patrol officers for the Fayette County Police Department were pleasantly surprised to discover the man they shot was armed, sources confirmed. "Well, what do you know--he really was carrying a gun," said officer Dustin Hayes, smiling upon finding a 9mm pistol on the body of the 23-year-old individual shortly after the policeman and his partner discharged their firearms a total of 19 times. "I honestly had no idea if he had a handgun, so it's pretty great to find one right there tucked into his waistband. This makes the rest of our week a whole lot easier." Officers said they were further relieved after discovering the man had a petty theft charge on his record, ensuring they were 100 percent off the hook.
