LeBron James and the Miami Heat had their 27-game win streak--the second longest in NBA history--snapped Wednesday night after a 101-97 loss to the Chicago Bulls. What do think? "This is the best news to come out of Chicago since that night only four people were shot and killed." "This streak would still be alive if the Heat had run their offense through Juwan Howard like I've been saying since day one." "Looks like they're only human assholes after all."
