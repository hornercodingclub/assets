The Supreme Court struck down a controversial Arizona law yesterday that required residents to provide proof of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote, noting that the rule had kept thousands of citizens off voter rolls because they lacked passports or drivers licenses. What do think? "Why on earth would Arizona enact a law like that? Don't they want everyone to vote?" Seth Folsey * Unemployed "But providing proof of citizenship was what set me apart. That was my whole thing." Rhonda Klopper * Key Cutter "I don't care if you're a citizen or not. If you can't drive, you shouldn't be allowed to vote." Josh Ruscio * Airplane Coverer
