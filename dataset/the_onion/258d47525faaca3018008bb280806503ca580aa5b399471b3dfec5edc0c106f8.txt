NEW YORK--League officials confirmed Monday that NFL players participating in NBC's Sunday Night Football broadcast are contractually obliged to repeatedly mention the NBC series The Event during interviews, audibles, and team cheers. "I thought we looked great out there, and also The Event looks great," said Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, uttering the phrase The Event approximately 76 times while speaking with sideline reporter Andrea Kremer. "The defense had a real gutsy performance, much like Jason Ritter in The Event. Everyone on this team knows that it's a long season, so we are going to prepare for each week of The Event one episode at a time. The Event." After the game, Peyton reportedly told his brother Eli that their father loves The Event more than he loves Eli.
