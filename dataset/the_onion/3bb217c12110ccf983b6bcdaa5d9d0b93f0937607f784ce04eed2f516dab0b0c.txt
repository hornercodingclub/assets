A Pew Research Center poll found that nearly 1 in 4 Americans had not read a single book or e-book in the past year, nearly tripling the figure from 1978, when only 8 percent of Americans hadn't read a book during the preceding 12 months.

Shellie Hoyt * Corporate Liaison "Sounds like 23 percent of Americans don't know about the free personal pan pizza you get through Pizza Hut's BOOK IT! reading program." Daniel Freedman * K-12 Curriculum Designer
