EUGENE, OR--Noting that it had yet to experience any sort of oneness with the 22-year-old, the universe confirmed Friday that it felt absolutely zero connection to a local man currently tripping on hallucinogenic mushrooms. "As far as I can tell, all the boundaries between myself and this guy remain completely intact, so I certainly wouldn't say that he and I have become one with each other at all," said the collection of all space and matter, which added that, if anything, it was feeling further removed from the man after he ate two grams of psilocybin mushrooms and spent the ensuing three hours just sitting on his basement couch, during which time he effectively did nothing to interact with the world or universe more broadly. "Frankly, I feel like he and I are as separate and unconnected as we've always been. Sure, he seems like a decent person, but have we at some level blended together into a single cosmic entity, flowing through each other and commingling our energies? Definitely not." At press time, the guy's mind also confirmed that it was in no way expanding whatsoever.
