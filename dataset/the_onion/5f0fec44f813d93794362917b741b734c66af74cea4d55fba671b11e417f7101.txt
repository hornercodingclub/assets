LOS ANGELES--After lifting a wounded police detective onto a gurney and wheeling him out to the street, paramedics reportedly paused for 15 seconds before loading the man into the back of an awaiting ambulance Wednesday night while he exchanged a few words with the protagonist. "Looks like you're a little late to the party," the veteran detective said hoarsely, forcing a brief smile onto his face before descending into a fit of coughs. "Don't worry, it'll take a lot more than this to bring me down. See you back at the precinct, partner." After the doors of the emergency vehicle shut behind the injured officer, sources confirmed that the protagonist, who remained standing in the street, was perfectly framed through one of the rear windows of the ambulance as it drove off down the road.
