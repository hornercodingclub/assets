MAMARONECK, NY--Phil Mickelson has fine-tuned his entire game for this week's U.S. Open at Winged Foot by preparing over 20 warm, folksy stories about him and his living father that, according to Mickelson, will propel him to a first-place finish should he find himself atop the leaderboard with "any competitor lacking paternal support." "I just really love my living dad, and I think that will come out in the fishing story I plan to tell at around the 16th hole on Championship Sunday, when golfers really need that added edge," Mickelson said. "I can't wait to call up my father, who will be alive to answer the phone, and share this win with him on Father's Day." Tiger Woods, Mickelson's main competition, has prepared several stories of his own, about the joys of playing golf right-handed, weight gain, and how somebody could possibly play a round of golf while his children have been kidnapped.
