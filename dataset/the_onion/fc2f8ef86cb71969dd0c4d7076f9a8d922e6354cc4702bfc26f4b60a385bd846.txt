During a debate last night, Richard Mourdock, a Tea Party-backed Republican Senate candidate from Indiana, said that instances of impregnation due to rape are "something that God intended to happen." What do think? "Typical mainstream media, reporting on a Republican's extremely offensive quote just because the guy said it." Sven Bauer * Veterinary Assistant "That's insulting. Everyone knows that God's ideal method of impregnation is two consenting adults too drunk to care about using a condom." Juliet Kozak * Systems Analyst "Boy, if we Republicans want to win this election, we have got to stop saying what we believe." George Bucossi * Sandstone Splitter
