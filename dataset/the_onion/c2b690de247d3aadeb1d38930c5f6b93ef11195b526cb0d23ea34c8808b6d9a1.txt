NEW YORK--As Brian Cashman watched another Yankees starting pitcher struggle during the first inning during Tuesday's game against the Blue Jays, the embattled general manager found himself unable to endure the tension any further, ripped off his tie and Oxford shirt to reveal a No. 99 Yankees jersey, and stormed onto the field to pitch eight scoreless innings. "The amazing thing is that besides Mr. Cashman having absolutely no playing experience, he didn't even warm up," Yankees pitching coach Ron Guidry said during a post-game press conference. "He wanted to go the whole game, and sure, I got booed when I pulled him, but I could see him losing a little edge on his curve[ball] around his 100th pitch and we need to save his arm for the rest of the season." Though Cashman's stellar performance received praise and admiration from Yankees fans, it was overshadowed in the national press by Washington GM Jim Bowden's complete game one-hitter.
