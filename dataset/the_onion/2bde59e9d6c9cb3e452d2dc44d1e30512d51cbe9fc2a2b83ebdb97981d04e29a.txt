HOUSTON--Confused by the seemingly unrelated collection of team decor throughout the establishment, patrons of Miller's Ale House speculated Thursday that a backstory probably exists to explain the Baltimore Orioles, Los Angeles Lakers, and Chicago Bears flags hanging outside the sports bar. "Well, maybe the owner was originally from Baltimore and grew up watching the Orioles, and if his parents were from Chicago, he might have become a Bears fan because of them," said 29-year-old Frank Hartwell, adding that some logical, yet-to-be-determined reason must account for a signed and framed Kobe Bryant jersey hanging next to a front page celebrating the Bears' 1985 Super Bowl win inside a Houston bar. "I guess there could be multiple owners, and if one of them is from L.A., but doesn't like baseball, that'd be why there isn't any Dodgers or Angels stuff. There's also this one University of Tennessee Vols pennant at the back of the bar, and I have no idea what that's about. I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for all this." At press time, the clientele had given up trying to figure out the bar's backstory after noticing multiple signed photos of former Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave Stieb hanging outside the bathrooms.
