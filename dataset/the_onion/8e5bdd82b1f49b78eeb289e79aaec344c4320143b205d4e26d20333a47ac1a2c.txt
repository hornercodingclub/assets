DENVER, CO--Though he is currently taking a brief sabbatical from golf to spend time with his family, David Duval once again entertained thoughts of dressing in a modest, clean-lined polo shirt, a crisp knee-length navy cotton skirt, and classic pedal-pusher golf shoes in the interest of entering the LPGA Tour under the name of Esperanze Duvette. "You don't suppose I... Huh," Duval said to himself while admiring a set of yellow-and-pink Callaway head covers at a Denver-area pro shop Tuesday. "I mean, what if I... I mean... Hmm." Duval then spent the better part of an hour alternating between staring wistfully at posters of Paula Creamer and holding Lycra-blend sport-dresses up in front of himself while peering in the shop's mirrors.
