CANTON, OH--In an effort to provide visitors a truly immersive look at the life of an NFL player, the Pro Football Hall of Fame reportedly unveiled a new exhibit Wednesday that allows museum patrons to experience the effects of suffering a concussion on the field of play. "This interactive display gives our guests the unique opportunity to see what it feels like to sustain a real traumatic brain injury as if they were actually being crushed into the turf," Hall of Fame executive director Stephen Perry said of the newly installed exhibit, in which museum guests insert their head and neck into a tightly fitted box that is then abruptly jolted in order to simulate a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit from a 250-pound linebacker. "We have gone to great lengths to ensure that the entire concussion experience produces the real physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms resulting from violent head trauma. And we believe our guests will find the entire process--from the moment their vision goes dark to their years and years of ensuing headaches, memory loss, and unpredictable mood swings--utterly fascinating." Perry noted that immediately following the moment of impact, the Hall of Fame's staff administers a cursory physical examination in which they determine that the recent concussion isn't anything serious, after which the visitor's head goes right back into the box.
