CEDAR RAPIDS, IA--Noting that the topic has been brought up at dinner several times this week, household sources confirmed Tuesday that local father Adam Pitzer works with a guy whose son plays Triple-A baseball. "Yeah, apparently he played Division I at LSU or something and then got drafted by the Orioles, and now he's one of the best pitching prospects in their farm system," said Pitzer's 15-year-old son Trent, noting that his father emailed him the player's stats page on the Norfolk Tides' official website with the subject line, "This is Mark's son!!!" "I think he was invited to spring training this year, but then got sent back to the minors. My dad kept saying he could pull some strings with Mark so we could meet his son the next time he's in town and get his autograph or whatever." At press time, Pitzer reportedly once again reminded his children that he could get tickets for local minor league outfit the Cedar Rapids Kernels whenever they wanted to go to a game.
