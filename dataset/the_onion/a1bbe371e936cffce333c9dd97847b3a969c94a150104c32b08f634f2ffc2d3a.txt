GLENDALE, CA--Saying the dishes were the perfect way to express compassion to those going through one of the darkest times of their life, representatives from Stouffer's unveiled Wednesday their new line of Frozen Bereavement Meals for bringing over to neighbors who have just lost a loved one. "When tragedy strikes someone we care about, we all want to reach out and offer our assistance, and with Stouffer's new Frozen Bereavement Meals, you can take a turkey casserole out of your freezer, pop it in the microwave, and be over on your grieving neighbor's doorstep in less than 10 minutes," said company spokeswoman Erin Carson, adding that the meals come in two convenient sizes to suit any mourner: an individual portion for a single widow or widower, and a family-size option for bereaved households of four or more. "Our new line of sympathy dinners features eight comforting and mouthwatering meal options, from flavorful meatloaf to hearty lasagna. Consoling devastated friends and neighbors has never been more quick and convenient." Carson added that the back of each box contains a cut-out condolence card, allowing consumers to pay their respects along with the meal.
