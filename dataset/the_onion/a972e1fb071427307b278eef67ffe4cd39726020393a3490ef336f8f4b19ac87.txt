MINNEAPOLIS, MN--Vowing to relentlessly battle and never back down, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) pledged this week in her campaign kickoff that she would never stop fighting everyday Americans. "I will stand up to the common man--with my fists," said Klobuchar, asserting that she would take on all Americans--rich, poor, black, white, straight, or gay--in an all-out brawl until every last one was bleeding and unconscious. "As president, I promise the American people an open exchange of blows. I will not hold back in beating every citizen to a pulp. Just like I've fought tooth and nail against the people of Minnesota." At press time, Klobuchar was spotted reaching out to undecided voters with a flurry of quick jabs and uppercuts.
