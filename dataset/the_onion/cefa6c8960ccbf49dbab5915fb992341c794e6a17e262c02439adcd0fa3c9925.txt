LONDON--In an effort to find an occupant who doesn't "bring the party home," officials at the Ecuadorian embassy in London ran an ad Thursday on several local flat-sharing websites seeking a "no drama" tenant for a newly vacant room. "We're looking for someone who can get along with a diverse group of foreign government dignitaries," read the ad in part, noting that the ideal roommate to fill the vacancy in the spacious multi-story home located in the quiet Kensington neighborhood would keep regular hours and not spend all their time in the apartment. "You must have a steady job and pay rent on time--this is non-negotiable due to past issues we've had. Guests are okay, but if you're constantly having over girlfriends, boyfriends, journalists, or activists, this is not the place for you." The ad requested that all interested parties attend the embassy's Saturday open house and be prepared with at least two past-roommate references and a security deposit of two months' rent.
