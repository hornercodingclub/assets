The Nobel Committee has attempted to contact singer-songwriter Bob Dylan multiple times since announcing him the winner of their prize in literature last week, though Dylan has yet to acknowledge the prize at all.

Henry Gibbs * Hubcap Shiner "But accepting this prize would make Dylan a sellout, much like appearing in Pepsi and Chrysler commercials." Zeke Pearl * Composting Advocate
