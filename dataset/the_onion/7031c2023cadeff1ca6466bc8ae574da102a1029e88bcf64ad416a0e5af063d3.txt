A Michigan State University study, which observed 3,700 people washing their hands in public bathrooms, found that only one in 20 people wash well enough to kill bacteria and other germs, with the other 95 percent not using soap, not scrubbing for the recommended 20 seconds, or not washing at all. What do think? "I wash my hands when and how I want, and I don't need some egghead telling me different." Brian Warren * Scientific Illustrator "That's strange. Usually I wash my hands longer whenever there's a guy standing there with a clipboard and stopwatch." Alvin Huffman * Unemployed "It's amazing we're all still alive."
