PHILADELPHIA--Affirming his distaste for larger social gatherings, local man Pete Trobeman told reporters last weekend he prefers evenings spent annoying a handful of close friends to irritating groups of strangers at parties. "The idea of picking up a six-pack and bothering the hell out of a few buddies for the night is far more appealing to me than, say, going to some random apartment and forcing myself to grate on the nerves of a bunch of people I don't even know," said Trobeman, 27, confirming he is most comfortable in settings where everyone already knows how unbearably obnoxious he is. "The way I see it, why should I meet all these new people and then go around monopolizing their conversations, insulting their personal interests, and making snide comments about the music playing when I could be doing the exact same thing with my usual group of friends?" Trobeman added that if given the choice, he usually prefers to stay at home and have a quiet night pissing off his roommate.
