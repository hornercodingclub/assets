AUSTIN, TX--Worrying that if she didn't have one soon she might not be able to have one at all, local 34-year-old Sarah Jean Bleicher told reporters Wednesday she realized she doesn't have much time left to have a career. "The clock is ticking--if I'm going to have a career, I can't put it off much longer," said Bleicher, adding that some of her friends from college were already on their second career. "Sure, I guess it's possible to have one later in life, but it gets so much harder as you get older. I have to face the real possibility that I might wind up careerless for the rest of my life, with no long-term occupational pursuit to nurture and devote myself to. God, that's sad." At press time, Bleicher said she was considering settling for a company that she only found somewhat attractive but that was eager to commit to her and help her develop professionally.
