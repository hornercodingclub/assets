PLAINSBORO, NJ--Local mother Ruth Conway, 38, reportedly expressed frustration Monday after realizing that her son's next Little League baseball game would be played an hour and a half away in Rockland County. "The game starts at seven, so we'll have to leave pretty much the second I get home from work tomorrow," said Conway, adding that she couldn't imagine getting back anytime before 11 p.m., "especially if the game goes as long as it usually does." "Why can't they just play down the road at Grover [Middle School]? There's a perfectly good baseball field, and it's only five minutes from the house." At press time, Conway, kitchen sources confirmed, had just grabbed the team phone list from the refrigerator and was calling other parents to ask if they could give her son a ride.
