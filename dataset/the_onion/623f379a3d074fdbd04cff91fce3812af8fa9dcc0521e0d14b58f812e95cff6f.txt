WASHINGTON--Tearing through the West Wing with guns slung over their shoulders, the Trump boys were reportedly seen Thursday chasing a wounded boar around the White House. "Look! Let's follow that blood trail!" said Donald Jr., who had been examining a clump of damp, sticky fur clinging to a curtain in the press secretary's office when he noticed a red trickle on the floor leading out to the West Colonnade. "I thought I had a clean kill, but I must've just hit his haunch! Come on, Eric! We can't let anyone from a tour group get to it first--that's our hog!" At press time, Donald Jr. had startled the boar in the Cabinet Room and pursued it into the Oval Office, where Eric reportedly shot the animal at point-blank range from behind the Resolute desk and giggled as the animal bled out onto the carpet's presidential seal.
