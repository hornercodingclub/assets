TAMPA, FL--Returning to the field for the first time since fracturing his left ankle last season, Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter reportedly attempted to take one step on the grass Sunday and shattered the ankle in 148 different places. "He kind of came down on it weird and the bones just burst into pieces," said Yankees manager Joe Girardi, confirming that Jeter suffered 38 compound fractures and had "shards of bone jutting out everywhere." "The sound of bones snapping and flesh tearing was so gruesome. It's really unfortunate, but honestly, we were surprised when Derek made it up the steps of the dugout." While the Yankees announced that Jeter will be placed on the 15-day disabled list, the team officials remain confident that the shortstop will be ready to return by opening day.
