CHICAGO--Growing increasingly ashamed as he imagined how many people must have already noticed, local man Matt Quinlan was reportedly humiliated Friday upon discovering ornate embroidery on his jeans' back pocket. "Oh, God, how did I miss this shit?" said Quinlan, 29, who cringed upon realizing that his shirt was not long enough to cover up the garish decorative stitches that would be in full view for the rest of the day. "Christ, I can't just walk around with this thing on my pants--everyone can see it. Goddammit. How did I miss this at the store?" At press time, a relieved Quinlan had managed to salvage the pants by cutting off the flashy back pocket with a pair of scissors.
