WASHINGTON--Explaining that this wasn't exactly what they had in mind, Americans across the country confirmed Wednesday they were kind of hoping for a different outcome when so many concerned citizens came together to make their voices heard. "It's great to see millions of disaffected Americans participating in the political process, but to be honest, I was thinking that all the civic engagement would lead to something truly inspirational, or at the very least pragmatic," said Baltimore resident Annie Fletcher, echoing a widely shared belief among the general populace that Americans flocking to the primary polls in record numbers would have resulted in some sort of positive difference that would, even if only in a small way, change the nation for the better. "With so many people worried about our nation's future and passionate about changing the status quo of politics, I guess I just imagined that such a broad outpouring of political interest and participation would be put toward solving problems, not, you know, . But I guess not." The nation later admitted feeling a deep sense of dread about what would happen if even more concerned Americans decide to make their voices heard in the general election.
