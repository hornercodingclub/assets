ORLANDO, FL--Promising to highlight the incredible talents of the biggest names in football, the NFL announced Thursday that passing the concussion protocol has been added as a competition in this year's Pro Bowl Skills Showdown. "I am excited to announce that for the first time ever, six All-Stars from the AFC and NFC will compete against one another to prove who can convincingly pass the league's sideline neurological exam after incurring a concussion," said league commissioner Roger Goodell, noting that in addition to quizzing concussed participants on their name and current location, the televised contest will feature a team of medical professionals measuring which players can most accurately recite the months of the year in reverse order while suppressing nausea and any visible signs of disorientation. "Over the course of the season, these athletes have showcased their amazing ability to score sufficiently on reflex and balance tests in order to be cleared to return to the playing field, and tonight, fans will have the opportunity to finally watch them compete head to head. This will truly pit the best against the best." Goodell added that the concussion protocol challenge will conclude with a special NFL alumni matchup between Hall of Fame quarterbacks Troy Aikman and Steve Young.
