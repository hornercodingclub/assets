WASHINGTON--Stating that the policy change represented the kind of reform taxpayers have long demanded, the IRS announced Tuesday that all refunds for the 2016 fiscal year will be disbursed in the form of Forever stamps. "Persons anticipating a refund will receive a ream of Forever stamps equal to the expected amount within six to eight weeks of filing their taxes," said IRS commissioner John Koskinen, explaining that someone with a $500 tax refund, for example, will receive an envelope containing 1,020 stamps, or roughly 51 booklets of the 49-cent postage. "We're very excited about this change, and we think the public will be equally enthusiastic about getting a refund they can use immediately to mail a variety of items without having to bother with the extra step of purchasing stamps with cash." Koskinen added that while a refund denominated in Forever stamps was not optional, taxpayers were free to choose among American flag, classic car, and Woodstock themes.
