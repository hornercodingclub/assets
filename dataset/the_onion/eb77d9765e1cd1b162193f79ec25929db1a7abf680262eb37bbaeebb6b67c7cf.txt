WASHINGTON--Excitedly drafting an email after discovering she had been included in the article, White House deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh reportedly sent her parents a article Monday that quoted her as an anonymous source. "Check it out, I made it onto the Times homepage!" read Walsh's email to her mother and father, including the link to an article in which she is cited only as a "White House aide" while describing the dysfunction within the West Wing. "They only used a little bit of what I said, but I'm the one talking about how increasingly isolated Trump was and how he was alienating members of his inner circle. It's the second anonymous quote, not the first--I actually have no idea who gave that one." Walsh's email reportedly also reminded her parents to record this weekend in the event Steve Kroft uses the classified memos she leaked to him.
