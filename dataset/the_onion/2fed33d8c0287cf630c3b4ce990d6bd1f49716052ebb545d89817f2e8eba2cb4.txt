The Boy Scouts of America voted during their annual meeting yesterday to allow the admittance of openly gay youths into the scouting program, while maintaining the organization's ban on homosexual adults as scout leaders.

JoAnn Moriceau * Slurry Mixer "Good. Now get out there and sell some popcorn!" Edward Boyd * Sign Hanger
