MEMPHIS, TN--In order to improve their 3-10 record, the last-place Memphis Grizzlies requested permission from NBA officials yesterday to take two weeks off so that they may practice their ball-handling skills, lay-ups, and passing. "Our inbound plays need a lot of work, and the majority of my guys don't know where they're going in our zone press," said head coach Mike Fratello, adding that the extra time will allow him to go over film for their December 16 game against the Miami Heat. "We also need to get on the same page in terms of knowing what the difference is between our 'Motion 1' and 'Motion 2' offense." According to Fratello, if his request is granted, the first thing he will do is gather his players at half court and show them what a triple-threat position is.
