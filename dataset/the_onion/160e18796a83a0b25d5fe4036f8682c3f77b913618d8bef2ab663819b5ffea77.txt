DALLAS--Citing such factors as overexpansion, player safety, and behavioral issues, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban told reporters Wednesday that the NFL is in severe danger of waning in popularity over the next 1,000 years. "The NFL is at its peak in terms of popularity right now, but they're getting a little too greedy, and they'll start losing fans in the next three or four centuries," said Cuban, adding that if officials and team owners aren't careful the NFL could fall to the second or third most popular sports league as early as 3014. "We've seen it with baseball; we've seen it with hockey; we've seen it with Roman chariot racing in 700 B.C. The NFL is going down the same path with all these new TV deals. It might not happen overnight, but people will turn on the sport before the millennium is out, I can guarantee you that." Cuban added that in contrast to the NFL's increasing saturation of the market, the NBA can return to the pinnacle of American sports by only playing 82 games in a six-month regular season.
