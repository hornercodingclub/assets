MEDFORD, MA--In a finding that upends longstanding assumptions about human mental capabilities, a Tufts University study published Monday has determined that gratification can actually be deliberately postponed. "We now have sound scientific evidence that suggests one can intentionally enjoy something at a point in time beyond this very moment," said study co-author Bennett Sims, adding that the data indicated that it could be possible to delay gratification for minutes, hours, or, theoretically, even days. "It appears that humans are, in fact, able to wait for a thing they want, and on very rare occasion even perceive that delaying the gratification might enhance it." The research comes on the heels of another study that found that humans actually have the emotional capacity to not complain every five minutes.
