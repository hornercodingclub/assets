LEXINGTON, VA--Speaking at a rally on Monday, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney told supporters his dramatic resurgence in the polls following last week's debate had once again proved that he deserves his well-known moniker, Turnaround Mitty from Comeback City. "Since as far back as I can remember, folks have been calling me Turnaround Mitty from Comeback City, and just like in Detroit, Massachusetts, and Salt Lake, Turnaround Mitty from Comeback City has pulled through," said Romney, adding that "the ol' T.M.F.C.C. has struck again." "There were many who doubted me, but everyone on the Nitty-Gritty Mitty Committee knew that Turnaround Mitty from Comeback City would one day be sitting pretty." The candidate added that rebounds such as this one also explain why his close friends like to call him the Salt Lake Sultan of Surge.
