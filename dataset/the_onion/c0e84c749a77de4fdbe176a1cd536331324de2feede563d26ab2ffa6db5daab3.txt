PHILADELPHIA--Phillies manager Charlie Manuel announced Thursday that a bruise specialist from the Johns Hopkins Hospital's contusion trauma center was brought in to examine a third-degree boo-boo on outfielder Shane Victorino's thigh. "It's never easy to say this, but in my professional opinion, Shane is definitely suffering from a light bruise," said Dr. Anthony Walker, adding that Victorino was being held overnight in a Level 1 bruise unit for observation. "The bruise appears to be about 2 centimeters in diameter and will eventually produce a yellowish discoloration, which means it's healing. However, judging from Shane's threshold for pain, it's going to be a while before he can stand the weight of heavy fabric on his leg again." Said Victorino, "It hurts, it hurts."
