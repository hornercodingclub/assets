WASHINGTON--Noting that he would happily lend his support to any candidate who just requested it, former President Barack Obama told reporters Friday he was kind of hurt no one in the 2020 Democratic field has even asked for his endorsement. "Look, I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I'm a two-term president with significant pull among Democratic voters and I can't help but feel a little bummed that no campaign has even raised the question of whether I'd consider endorsing them," said the 44th commander in chief, stressing that he would happily express his full-throated approval for Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the race's other candidates if they had even so much as broached the topic with him during recent in-person conversations, email chains, and phone calls. "Especially Joe. I mean, I worked with the guy for eight years, and he hasn't even reached out to test the waters. I'm not trying to overstate my significance, but it's not crazy to think my vouching for what he did as vice president could really change the way this race shakes out, right? I mean, what the hell? I feel like a forgotten man over here." At press time, the former president had sighed and started drafting an enthusiastic endorsement of Tulsi Gabbard after receiving a request from one of the representative's assistants.
