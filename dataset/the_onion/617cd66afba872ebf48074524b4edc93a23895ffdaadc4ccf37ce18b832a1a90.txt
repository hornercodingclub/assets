Bill Clinton is collaborating with best-selling author James Patterson on a thriller novel titled The President Is Missing. What do think? "They're just using Clinton because he's a big name and was kidnapped during his presidency." Doug Salerno * Pearl Diver "If any author can turn a former president's unique insight into a novel bound for a $1 bargain bin, it's Patterson." Mitch Porter * Rim Salter "Ooh, they should set a scene in the Oval Office!" Kathy Jungman * Stun Gun Tester
