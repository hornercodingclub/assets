CLEVELAND--After giving up seven earned runs over just five innings against the Indians Tuesday, Blue Jays starter A.J. Burnett told reporters that his ineffectiveness on the mound could be attributed to "the stupid good hitters on the other team who kept hitting all my pitches." "Stupid good hitters, always hitting home runs," said Burnett, responding to a question about his inability to locate the curveball. "I was throwing the ball real fast, but it's like they couldn't miss. Every single guy, too, not just the good ones. Ooh, they think they're so great, getting doubles and triples and RBIs. Stupid bunch of jerks." Burnett added, however, that he would have fared better if his dumb defense could ever catch a ball for once in their lives.
