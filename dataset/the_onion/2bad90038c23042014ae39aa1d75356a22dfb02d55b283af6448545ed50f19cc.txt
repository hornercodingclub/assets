CHICAGO--A study released Thursday by the University of Chicago's Department of Psychology has found that debilitating self-pity is the most effective strategy to win back the love of a former romantic partner. "Our research shows that the more you lament your current situation, fixating on how you'll never find anyone as good as your ex and how you can't possibly enjoy life now that he or she is gone, the sooner that person will return to you and say he or she can't live without you," said report co-author Sylvia Hawkins, adding that researchers discovered a link between sitting on the couch all day staring teary-eyed into space and one's former partner walking right back through the door. "The data revealed that ex-partners are twice as likely to call you up and say that the breakup was the biggest mistake of their lives if you torture yourself incessantly until you can barely function at work. Furthermore, we determined that there was a direct correlation between how much you feel sorry for yourself and the probability of an ex-lover desperately begging you to forgive him or her for leaving you." The report also concluded that holding your head up high and moving on with your life virtually guaranteed that you would never find love again.
