DURHAM, NC--Despite being a long-avowed fan of the British comedian, actor, and director, local nerd Josh Russell is liable to turn against Simon Pegg without any warning whatsoever, sources confirmed Tuesday. "Right now he loves Pegg's stuff, but knowing Josh, 45 seconds from now he could be talking about how, in hindsight, and weren't all that great," said Russell's friend Chandra Hughes, noting how the 37-year-old is capable of sudden, unprompted reversals of opinion on nearly any topic. "In the blink of an eye he might very well start calling them 'cheap, hack-job slapstick' and asking if we're 'really still watching Simon Pegg in 2013.' It will be like his Joss Whedon reversal all over again." At press time, sources indicated that Russell had just finished watching and was letting out an equivocal sigh, seemingly gathering his thoughts, and preparing to speak.
