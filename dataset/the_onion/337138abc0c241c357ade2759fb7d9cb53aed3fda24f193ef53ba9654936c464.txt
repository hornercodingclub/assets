ATLANTA--Calling the choice "a no-brainer," Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan reportedly voted "no" this morning in an ESPN.com poll that asked, "Is Matt Ryan an elite NFL quarterback?" "Uh, no, obviously I'm not an elite player," Ryan said as he submitted his answer, adding that he was "definitely not even in the top 10" and listing eight better quarterbacks right off the top of his head. "I mean, for starters, I have no pocket presence, my accuracy is pretty middle-of-the-road, and most importantly, I'm just not a born leader. Sure, the Falcons are 4-0, but so what? Who have they even played this year? Fucking nobody. They'll be lucky to even make the playoffs." On reviewing the poll's results, Ryan noticed that more than 90 percent of voters from Georgia had selected "yes," a decision he called "idiotic."
