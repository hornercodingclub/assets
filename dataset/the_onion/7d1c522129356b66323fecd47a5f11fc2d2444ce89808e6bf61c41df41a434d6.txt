WEST PALM BEACH, FL--Admitting it has had its eye on the property for quite some time, the Atlantic Ocean confirmed Monday that it was looking forward to moving into a beautiful beachfront mansion in the near future. "For the longest time it seemed like this place was completely out of reach for me, but I've come a long way in the past few years, and now it's looking more and more like a real possibility," said the body of water, which confided that, after having admired the building's impressive exterior and grounds for so long, it was thrilled at the prospect of finally going inside and exploring all eight bedrooms and 7,500 square feet of living area. "I'm not quite ready yet, but in a couple years or so, I can definitely see myself in there, making the place completely my own. And the little beachside community that the house is located in is just so cute, too--I can't wait to go through and visit all the shops and restaurants." The ocean noted, however, that it might make a few cosmetic changes to the mansion once it moves in, including gutting the lower floor and taking out a few walls.
