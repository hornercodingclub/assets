CHARLOTTE, NC--Bobcats owner Michael Jordan announced Wednesday that he has officially hired Patrick Ewing as the team's assistant coach purely to watch the former New York Knicks center lose more. "I'm thrilled to add Patrick to the coaching staff, and I am very happy to once again be the person responsible for Patrick losing game after game after game," said Jordan, adding that much like their heated rivalry in the 1990s, Jordan will have a front-row seat to watch Ewing consistently fail on the basketball court. "I'm incredibly confident that with our roster of players, and under the tutelage of our head coach, Steve Clifford, Patrick will be frustrated, upset, and constantly question whether or not his team is good enough to reach the playoffs, let alone win an NBA Title. Putting him through that kind psychological torment again couldn't excite me more." Sources later confirmed Jordan was also in negotiations to bring on former Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo so that he could "make that guy's life a living hell all over again too."
