PAWTUCKET, RI--Adopting the sagely demeanor of an all-knowing oracle, local man Jacob Rivard, 29, who is a season ahead of friends in his viewing of the television series , is reportedly conferring advice about the show as if it were the sacred wisdom of ages. "Oh, you're not to that part yet?" the august and enlightened elder said Monday, casting his clairvoyant eye to the future and cryptically alluding to what wonders lie there. "Well, just wait for the season-four finale. You have no idea. Everything is about to change, and Walt's character will--no, I'm not going to say any more. You have to see it for yourself." Sources indicated the learned man then grew reticent, responding to every question with an enigmatic smile and the words "You'll find out soon enough."
