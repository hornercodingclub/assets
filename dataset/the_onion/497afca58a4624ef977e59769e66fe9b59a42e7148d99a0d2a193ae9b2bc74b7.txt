NEW ORLEANS--Sources within the Saints organization confirmed Wednesday that players, coaches, and executives alike are all "perfectly satisfied" and "completely okay" with the team's eight-win, no-loss performance thus far in the 2009 NFL season. "The Saints feel that Drew Brees' 106.1 quarterback rating, Reggie Bush's flashes of athletic brilliance, and Darren Sharper's seven interceptions are particularly satisfactory," team sources said. "Moreover, we are reasonably pleased with the prospect of facing the Rams and Buccaneers, both one-win teams, over the next couple weeks. It's nice." A spokesman for the Indianapolis Colts, the NFL's other undefeated team, said that quarterback Peyton Manning has been disappointed and discouraged by his team's perfect performance and was undergoing treatment for depression.
