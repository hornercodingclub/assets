PITTSBURGH--Calling it a perfect way to rapidly replenish essential nutrients after an intense workout, Heinz on Wednesday introduced a new quick-recovery sports ketchup to their line of food products. "Our new Post-Workout Recovery Ketchup is specially formulated with electrolytes and a dozen other minerals to help you rehydrate, re-energize, and get back in the game," said Heinz spokesperson Danny Paylor of the condiment, which comes in both bottles and single ketchup packets he described as a "great on-the-go energy squirt" for athletes. "Whether it's serious cardio or heavy reps on weights, this ketchup is supercharged with enough potassium and magnesium to restore you to peak performance fast--you don't want to hit the gym without it." Paylor went on to say that the ketchup works most effectively if paired with Heinz's new Pre-Workout Homestyle Relish.
