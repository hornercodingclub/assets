LONDON--Shedding light on her creative process amid announcements of her forthcoming book, trilogy author E.L. James conceded Thursday that her new erotic novel, , had begun as a piece of fanfiction about the '90s animated TV show . "There was so much exciting chemistry between these characters on the screen that I just had to explore their sexual energy on the page, and while I may have changed their names for legal reasons, at their core they're still very much the gang," said James of the novel that follows the erotic escapades of a group of college students--adapted from characters Babs Bunny, Buster Bunny, Hamton J. Pig, and others--as they navigate the depraved sexual fantasies of their professor at a school based on Acme Looniversity. "Believe it or not, the dashing Professor Dodd character from my book first took form as a taller, more humanoid, and sexually insatiable version of Gogo Dodo, who in the cartoon always struck me as this very carnal being. So the whole novel is really just an expansion on that." James went on to describe in detail an extended BDSM sequence inspired by the relationship between Sweetie Pie and Montana Max.
