SAN FRANCISCO--With NFL free agency looming, every team across the league is gearing up to compete for coveted star wide receiver Randy Moss, wide receiver Randy Moss reported Saturday. "After leading the 49ers to the Super Bowl with yet another stellar season, Randy Moss is going to be the hottest free agent pickup of 2013," said Moss, adding that the San Francisco front office will do their utmost to re-sign the 35-year-old wideout, but will face incredibly stiff competition from the other 31 NFL franchises. "Teams are already clearing cap space and making room on their roster just in case they have a shot at landing Moss. He's far and away the best receiver in the league, so frankly even the slightest prospect of signing him is enough to have every GM excited."
