SANTA FE, NM--In yet another stunning twist that has reportedly shocked fans and law enforcement officials alike, fantasy author George R.R. Martin surprised viewers Sunday night by killing off his entire family, sources confirmed. "Wow, I definitely did not see that coming," said Atlanta man Todd Franklin after learning that the scribe had mercilessly butchered his wife, two sisters, and countless members of his extended family in cold blood after locking them inside his Santa Fe residence. "To think that he slit the throats of all those major relatives like that, in the blink of an eye, it's just crazy. He definitely keeps you on your toes, that's for sure." While fans of the HBO series were blindsided by the unexpected and brutal murders, longtime readers of Martin's books told reporters that they were not at all surprised to see the novelist commit such atrocities, as that's exactly what he did to several other close friends and relatives 12 years ago.
