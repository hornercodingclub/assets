NEW YORK--Providing further evidence of the hesitancy in professional sports to accept homosexual athletes as equals, a new poll published Thursday revealed that more than 97 percent of NFL players are still not ready to date a gay teammate. "Throughout the league there's a lot of archaic attitudes toward homosexuality, and I'm just not sure NFL players are comfortable enough to enter a monogamous relationship with a gay teammate," said an anonymous player who felt that a steady dating situation with a homosexual teammate wouldn't be worth the distractions in the locker room. "I think most players would be open to a one-night stand with a gay teammate, but I really can't see them tolerating a long-term homosexual relationship." The poll also revealed that 50 percent of active players would prefer not to know the sexual orientation of a teammate they were fucking.
