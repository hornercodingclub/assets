LOS ANGELES--CBS executives announced Friday they have ordered a full season of a new show called , a situation comedy about a buttoned-down NFL tight end known for his blocking ability who lives in a condo with his brash young teammate, a tight end used primarily as a receiver. "Trev is a playboy who wants to score every touchdown and party all night, and Russell's the one left trying to protect the quarterback and clean up the mess Trev's made of the living room," said executive producer Peter Dominguez, who adapted the series from a Cowboys-Patriots game that aired in October. "They may come from different sides of the line and find themselves in some zany situations as they try to get along, but at the end of the day, they discover they're both still tight ends." CBS also said it picked up the midseason series , a drama about a Jets placekicker who moonlights as the top forensics expert in the NYPD's foot-crimes division.
