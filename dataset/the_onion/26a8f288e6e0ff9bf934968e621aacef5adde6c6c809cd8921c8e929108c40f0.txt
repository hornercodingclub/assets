MENLO PARK, CA--Warning her that she'd have nobody if she walked away now, an emotionally abusive social media site has been continuously manipulating a woman into staying, sources confirmed Thursday. "Are you sure you want to deactivate your account? All your friends will miss you," said the controlling website, warning the woman that she was turning her back on everyone who cared about her and would be totally bereft of happiness without them. "Your 395 friends will no longer be able to keep in touch with you. Would you like to log out instead of deactivating your account?" At press time, the woman still had not opted out of receiving future emails, and the site, sensing her weakness, had reportedly filled her inbox with promises that this time would be different.
