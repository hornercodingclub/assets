TUALATIN, OR--Twenty-seven-year-old local resident Tom Portwood reportedly watched the X Games for nearly a half-hour Saturday, curious to see if that kid who skateboarded in high school was now participating in any of the events. "I think his name was Jake Baggenstoff, and I remember he was pretty good even when we were freshmen," Portwood told reporters, recalling that Baggenstoff had been featured in a couple skating videos for sale at Zumiez and definitely had a sponsor at some point. "I saw him in a picture with Tony Hawk once. I'm not sure if they were skating against each other or Jake was just a fan, but who knows?" Although Portwood did not see Baggenstoff, he was fairly certain the guy who won third place in BMX Freestyle Big Air was the kid from one town over who always wrapped his bicycle in electrical tape.
