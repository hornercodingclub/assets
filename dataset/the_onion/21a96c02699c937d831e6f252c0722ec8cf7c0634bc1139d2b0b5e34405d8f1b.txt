NOVI, MI--Vowing to give such an important request the respect it deserves, local Chili's server Melissa Cortez told reporters Friday that she was unbelievably touched to be asked by a customer for her opinion on whether the enchiladas or burger was a better choice. "Oh, wow, for a lowly waiter like me to be asked by a patron whether I prefer the Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas or the Southern Smokehouse Burger is just an incredible honor," said a visibly emotional Cortez, adding that she never thought the day would come when a customer would not only look to her for guidance but also value her views on the tastiness of different menu items. "It's such a huge compliment to have my food preferences given equal weight to those of the people I serve. I'm truly moved by it. I'll make sure to think carefully about this because whatever I say could sway their entire order, and that is a huge responsibility that should not be taken lightly." Cortez added that after much deliberation, she informed the table that, "to be honest, you can't go wrong with either."
