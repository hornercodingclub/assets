FALL RIVER, MA--While testifying during the murder trial of fiance and former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, Shayanna Jenkins told prosecutors Monday that she had absolutely no idea what incriminating evidence was in the box he asked her to throw out. "I didn't look inside, so I have no way of knowing if there was a gun in there, or a pile of bloody towels," said Jenkins, adding that the box weighed roughly 40 pounds and therefore, for all she knew, could also have contained some shell casings removed from the scene of the crime. "Something in there rattled around a bit, but it might have just been a roll of duct tape or a knife with his fingerprints on it. All I know is that it definitely wasn't the shoes Aaron wore that night, because I got rid of those a couple of hours before that." When asked to be more specific with her answers, a visibly emotional Jenkins told the prosecution that it was difficult for her to recall the exact events defense attorneys told her happened that night.
