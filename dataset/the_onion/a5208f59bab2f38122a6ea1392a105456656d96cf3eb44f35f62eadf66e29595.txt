PHILADELPHIA--As they continued to monitor the 12-year veteran for concussion symptoms, Eagles team doctors announced this morning that they would not clear quarterback Michael Vick to play this Sunday after hearing him claim his team "still has a great chance" to make the playoffs. "When Michael said that it immediately raised all kinds of medical red flags," said head physician Dr. Peter DeLuca, adding that highly irrational delusions such as Vick's were a classic symptom of severe concussions. "As a doctor, I cannot in good conscience let a player walk onto the field believing that the Philadelphia Eagles--a 3-6 team that has already lost to both the Cardinals and the goddamn Detroit Lions--have even the faintest hope of reaching the postseason." DeLuca confirmed that medical personnel grew even more concerned about Vick's condition after the quarterback held up seven fingers when asked how many more games the Eagles would win this season.
