WASHINGTON--Saying he didn't want any "cheap-ass, dull ones," Vice President Joe Biden quietly asked Barack Obama to pick him up some of those real throwing stars during his upcoming diplomatic visit to Japan, White House sources confirmed Friday. "Listen, Barry, I need the real deal, so when you're over there next week, snag me a few super sharp ones crafted by a master throwing star maker," said Biden, adding that he would prefer it if the president could find a few bladed throwing weapons that had "some cool Japanese shit written on them." "The ones they hawk at the Oriental Imports kiosk in the mall are basically useless tinfoil junk. Believe me, I've whipped those fuckers as hard as I can, and they never stick to anything. They sure as shit ain't sharp enough to pin some guy's nutsack to a tree." At press time, Biden was writing out a list for the president that included ninja climbing spikes, smoke bombs, and "some of that good tentacle erotica they got over there."
