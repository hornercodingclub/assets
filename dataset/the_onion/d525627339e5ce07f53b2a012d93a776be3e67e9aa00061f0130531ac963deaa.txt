WASHINGTON--President Obama left attendees of the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in stitches Saturday night after delivering a hilarious speech repeatedly telling the entire room to "fuck off." "No, seriously, each and every one of you cocksuckers can go fuck yourselves; I fucking hate all of you," Obama said to the uproarious laughter and applause of the assembled politicians and media personalities. "Stop laughing. I'm not fucking kidding, idiots. All of you gathered here today are a bunch of spineless, hypocritical pieces of shit, and I have absolutely zero respect for anyone in this room. So, fuck you all, and may you and your families go straight to fucking hell." Critics have praised Obama's performance at the annual dinner, saying the president's jokes were sharp and his timing has "never been better."
