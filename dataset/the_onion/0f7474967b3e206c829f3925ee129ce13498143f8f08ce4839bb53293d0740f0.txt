GLENDALE, AZ--Following a remarkable performance in his team's victory over the Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner, the last remaining member of the Cardinals' 1947 championship team, took a moment to reflect on his long NFL career. "Marshall Goldberg, Babe Dimancheff, and Elmer Angsman--they were a great group of guys who would have loved to have been a part of this," Warner told reporters, adding, "You know, they didn't call it the Super Bowl back then. I mean no disrespect to this Cardinal team, or the one I led to the championship in 1925, but there was something special about that '47 squad." Though Warner said he has fallen out of touch with many of his former teammates, he still keeps in contact with 149-year-old Walter Camp, head coach of the Yale Bulldog team Warner led to a national championship in 1888.
