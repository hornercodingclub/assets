ITHACA, NY--In the hours since the Republican nominee's stunning election to the nation's highest office Tuesday night, reports have confirmed that, regardless of circumstance, it is not even remotely close to okay to act like Donald Trump. "Just to be perfectly clear, speaking or behaving in a manner similar to President-elect Trump is just as unacceptable now as it has ever been," the reports stated, adding that in zero percent of cases is it even borderline permissible to conduct oneself either personally or professionally in a fashion akin to Trump, and that has not changed in the past two days. "In fact, acting like Mr. Trump does for even a moment will result in a wide range of negative social--and in some cases, criminal--consequences for you personally. Put simply, you should not be engaging with the world in any way comparable to Mr. Trump. This was true before he was elected, and it will be true long after he's gone." At press time, the reports' findings were being summarily dismissed out of hand by roughly 45 percent of the nation's population in a manner identical to that of Donald Trump.
