BOSTON--Examining a wide variety of cross-cultural data, a Boston University study released Monday determined that other countries are weird. "From family structure to politics to recreational activities, our survey of over 100 nations around the world found that other countries are strange and different, and don't do things the normal way," said lead author Nathan Bartz, noting that people in other countries dress pretty crazy, don't listen to regular music, and drive cars that are kind of odd. "The research also strongly suggested that people in other countries usually talk weird and eat different things, and have some really bizarre-looking buildings--none of which should be surprising, given how weird these people behave as a whole." Bartz went on to say, however, that England is actually kind of normal, but still has some weird stuff.
