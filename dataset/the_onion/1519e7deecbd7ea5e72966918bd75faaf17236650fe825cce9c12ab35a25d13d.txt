WASHINGTON--As part of his administration's continued efforts to stimulate the economy and liven up a slow weeknight, President Obama announced today that, effective immediately, Tuesdays will be half-off for ladies nationwide. "It is imperative to our economic health that we inject capital wisely and get some blondes in here, preferably hot young ones," said Obama, who submitted a proposal before Congress to increase tube-top usage by 200 percent. "We can only escape this recession with the full cooperation of the American people--so ladies, please, bring your girlfriends. When did this country turn into such a sausage fest?" According to estimates by the Department of the Interior, the first national Ladies' Night will be attended by an estimated 117 million men and one bachelorette party.
