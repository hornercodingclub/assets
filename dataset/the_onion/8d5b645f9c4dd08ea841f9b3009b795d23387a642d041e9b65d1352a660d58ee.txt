LOS GATOS, CA--In a swift and unexpected departure from their present business model, officials from Netflix revealed Wednesday that the company is currently considering adding a good movie to their online streaming service. "With the growing success of the streaming platform, we thought the time was right to think about possibly offering, just for the sake of variety, one film that wasn't a total critical and commercial flop forgotten immediately after its initial theatrical release," said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sandaros, adding that the company is exploring various options for licensing a single high-quality movie that people would in fact enjoy watching and wouldn't turn off after the first 25 minutes. "We feel the addition of a popular, above-average, well-made film would provide a nice counterbalance to our existing library of poorly received sequels, totally unknown indie dramas from four or five years ago that you've never heard of, and horrendous direct-to-DVD horror features." At press time, Netflix had reportedly abandoned the plan and added to its streaming library.
