Hawaiians were alarmed after the Emergency Management Agency accidentally sent out a message warning them of an inbound missile, which administrators say was caused by an employee selecting the wrong option in a dropdown menu for an internal test. What do think? "I'm still mad that I had to tell my family how much I love them." Nancy Revere * Systems Administrator "Meanwhile powerful dropdown menu interests are going to ensure this issue is never resolved." Todd Waites * Town Hall Historian "Listen, I've been there. It was three days ago, when I pressed the wrong button, falsely warning the entire state of Hawaii about an inbound missile." Stewart Cantor * Government Employee
