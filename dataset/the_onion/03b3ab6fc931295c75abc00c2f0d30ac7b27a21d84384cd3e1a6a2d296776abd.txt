WASHINGTON--Denying widespread claims that the franchise is being offensive or disrespectful, the Washington Redskins' kike owner announced Monday that he remains steadfast in his refusal to change the team's derogatory name. "The Redskins represent 81 years of great history and tradition, and it's a source of pride for our fans," said the hook-nosed kike, stressing that the team's insulting moniker is "absolutely not a racial slur by any means." "'Washington Redskins' is much more than just a name. It stands for strength, courage, and respect--the very values that are so intrinsic to Native American culture." The shifty-eyed hebe went on to assure fans that he will do "everything in his power" to preserve the team's proud heritage.
