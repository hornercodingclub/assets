COLUMBIA, SC--Saying the fetid stench of spoiled meat perfectly set the mood for romance, local housefly Tztsz on Wednesday fondly recalled losing his virginity on a decomposing pile of ground beef. "It was such a wonderful experience--we found this nice slimy clump of discolored beef rotting in an open trash can and made sweet love," said Tztsz, adding that the putrefied wad of ground chuck was a popular spot where several hundred of his buddies also had sex for the first time. "I didn't even expect Zztzzz and I to go all the way that night, but the moonlight shined so beautifully on the gray, festering meat that I guess we couldn't help ourselves. The next thing I knew, she was putting her ovipositor into my genital opening. Well, you never forget where you lost your virginity, and I'm glad I lost mine on that lump of putrid flesh that had been sitting outside for days." Tztsz went on to say that he'd always have a cherished memory even if he never had sex again in the three remaining weeks of his lifespan.
