A posthumously published book in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy series titled will be published this year. Depicting the elven city of Gondolin--and its sacking by the dark lord Morgoth--the book was assembled by the author's son from notes and journals in his archives. What do think? "It's so cool of Tolkien's son to keep his father's profits alive." Tyler Winston * Porcelain Doll Duster "Pretty impressive that Tolkien can keep cranking these out at 126." Nicole Kapernick * Systems Analyst "Finally, something for the Morgoth fans!" Douglas Bryans * Landfill Night Watchman
