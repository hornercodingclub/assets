--Claiming there was "no excuse" for tolerating weakness, Lakers guard Kobe Bryant publicly called out his teammates Thursday for their failure to condemn center Pau Gasol's lackluster play this season. "We all need to step up, get right in his face, and vilify him like we really mean it," said Bryant, who encouraged the entire team to "come together and just attack, attack, attack" the 7-foot-1 Spaniard. "Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one denouncing Pau's weak style of play every single night. That's not acceptable. This has to be a team effort. I want our bench guys to get involved. Coach [Mike D'Antoni] is with me on this, but even he knows he could be doing more." Bryant also issued a challenge to each and every one of his teammates to draw technical fouls for fighting with Pau Gasol during Friday's game against the Thunder.
