Disney confirmed Thursday plans to reimagine Splash Mountain, which is based on the 1946 movie , into a new log-flume ride following Princess Tiana and her alligator Louis as they travel on a musical adventure. What do think? "Good on Di sney for finally replacing that ride with a property that's more merchandisable." Martin Bucklin * Systems Analyst "Had I known the ride was racist I would have never had such a blast all the times I rode it." Janet Teegarden * Rain Collector "We can't just erase our heritage of Black sharecroppers singing to animated bees." Frederic Kretchmer * Pullup Instructor
