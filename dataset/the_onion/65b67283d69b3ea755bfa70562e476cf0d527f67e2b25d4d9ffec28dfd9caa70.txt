DANVILLE, KY--In the middle of tonight's debate between and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), Centre College security guards were forced to remove from the auditorium five of the vice president's loud and unruly friends: Darius, Blaze, Tank, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Dozer. "My buddies tend to go a little wild during these things--what can I say?" a smiling Biden said as eight security guards hauled away the drunken roughhousers for loudly whistling whenever the vice president spoke, repeatedly catcalling debate moderator Martha Raddatz, and throwing beer cans at Ryan following his opening statement. "Thanks for coming out, fellas! I'll meet you guys back at my suite for a smoke-out after. Take care of the pack, Blaze." Minutes after she was ejected, a staggering, inebriated Pelosi rolled up her sleeves and told reporters she planned on waiting in the auditorium's back alley to "have a little talk" with Paul Ryan after the debate.
