NEW YORK--A chorus of boos accompanied by shouts of  "You suck!" "Get out of town, asshole!" and "Die!" could be heard from the New York Yankees dugout Monday when Yankee third baseman Alex Rodriguez was briefly shown on the stadium's jumbotron during opening day ceremonies, team sources confirmed. "You're not a true Yankee and you never were!" Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano reportedly screamed at the center-field video screen when a stadium cameraman focused on Rodriguez, who was sitting next to Cano in the dugout at the time. "Fuck you, Fuck-Rod! You little bitch." While Yankee players and coaches proceeded to flip off Rodriguez's projected image, the third baseman appeared unaffected, staring straight ahead and eating sunflower seeds.
