PHOENIX--As Newt Gingrich continues to cede ground to Rick Santorum, the former House speaker's campaign team has responded by advising him to stay focused on the belligerent, mean-spirited message that has long been the hallmark of his presidential run, sources confirmed Monday. "Newt's rhetoric can become abstract and idiosyncratic at times, and we have to gently remind him that he just needs to be himself, to be the Newt people are familiar with--the Newt devoid of any discernible scruple beyond his own insatiable instinct for self-promotion," campaign director Michael Krull said Friday, explaining that whatever lies at Gingrich's cold, depraved core is what will make or break him with voters. "Every time he veers off course and talks passionately about about outer space or how the United States has to stop spending beyond its means, I tell him, 'Look, your greatest asset is being a remorseless asshole. Now get out there, fuck everyone over using every means at your disposal and let's win this thing.'" Several handlers told reporters they live in fear of a gaffe in which Gingrich displays some vague semblance of humanity and completely loses his identity among voters.
