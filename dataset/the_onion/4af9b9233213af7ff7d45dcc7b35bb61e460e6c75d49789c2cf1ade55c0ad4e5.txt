Ruling that lap dances do not qualify for tax-exempt status as a "dramatic or musical art performance," a New York court has ordered a gentleman's club to pay nearly $125,00 in back taxes.

Kirsten Anderson * Stop Attacher "What about if she pees on you? Doesn't that make things art these days?" Jonah Elliman * Unemployed
