A new series of 19 animated shorts featuring 85-year-old Disney icon Mickey Mouse, which will be set in modern-day versions of New York, Paris, Beijing, and other locales, is slated to premiere on the Disney Channel in late June. What do think? "That's uncanny. Just the other day I was thinking, 'I wish that everything created prior to 10 years ago had a more modern sensibility.'" Tessa Mitchell * Kick Press Operator "About time. All I hear from my kids is, 'We want Mickey Mouse! We want Little Lulu! We want Sluggo and Nancy!'" Paul Featherstone * Dental Ceramist "Oh, I can't wait to see what Mickey's been up to! I'm hoping a ton of mild adventures and a fair share of harmless hijinks." Albert Lobb * Prospecting Driller
