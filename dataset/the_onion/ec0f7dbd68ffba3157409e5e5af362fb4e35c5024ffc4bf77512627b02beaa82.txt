MINNEAPOLIS--The fourth-place Minnesota Twins finally came to realize baseball teams can score more than one run in a single play when, in the fifth inning of their 4-6 loss to the Cleveland Indians last Monday, they witnessed their opponents do just that. "It doesn't seem like it should be allowed," said Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, who ran out of the dugout to protest when he saw two Cleveland players touch home plate. "We've never tried to pull anything like that. Quite frankly, it looks pretty hard. First off, you'd almost have to be in a situation where two people were on base, and then if you could manage that, a hitter would have to hit the ball so far away from the fielders that there would be little chance of getting it back to the catcher before the second runner reached home plate. Sounds crazy to me." Though he admitted the team still did not quite understand how scoring multiple runs works, Gardenhire called it a "cheap gimmick" and said the Twins would not attempt it anytime soon.
