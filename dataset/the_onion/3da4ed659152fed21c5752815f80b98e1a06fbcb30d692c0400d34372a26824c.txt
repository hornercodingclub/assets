CHARLOTTE, NC--Though they never formed a tight-knit bond as kids and still haven't as adults, siblings Macy and Kyle Treadgold continue to wait patiently for the day they'll finally grow close to each other, sources reported Thursday. "I thought it might happen when I was a senior in college and she was a freshman, because I figured the chance to hang out away from our parents would bring us closer together, but yeah, that didn't happen," said Kyle Treadgold, 31, whose sister Macy, 29, confirmed that despite saying "I love you" after their infrequent phone conversations, the siblings still feel no real connection at all. "Then when we were both in our twenties and living in the same city, I thought for sure we were finally at that age when we'd become friends. But somehow that didn't pan out either. At this point, I think it may take a major family tragedy for us to form a lasting tie. We'll probably have to wait until Mom or Dad dies." According to a report suddenly received at press time, even that hasn't managed to do it.
