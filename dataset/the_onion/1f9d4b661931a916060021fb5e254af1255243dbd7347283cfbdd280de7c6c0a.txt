NEW YORK--Proclaiming that football fans can now watch "every long snap, every Sunday," the NFL officially unveiled its new Long Snap game-day television network Sunday. "Featuring every big play from the likes of Jon Condo, Patrick Mannelly, and Tanner Purdum, NFL Long Snap brings you the action every time a ball is snapped 10 to 15 yards for a field goal or punt--live and in high-definition," read a press release from the league, which also noted that programming will include in-depth analysis from former NFL long snappers David Binn and Mike Schneck. "Fans can watch Greg Warren snapping the ball for an extra point in Pittsburgh and in the very next second be in Carolina as J.J. Jansen snaps on a punt from the Panthers' 25. If two long snaps are happening at the same time, our new channel will show you both simultaneously on split screens. You'll never have to worry about missing a long snap ever again." When reached for comment, an NFL spokesman also confirmed that the league is developing another network to broadcast every touchback from around the league.
