COOPERSTOWN, NY--A joint study released Friday by Baseball Hall of Fame researchers and NASA scientists concluded that Babe Ruth was not "calling his shot" during Game 3 of the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs, but was in fact pointing out the position in the sky where Halley's comet would appear 54 years later. "When you look carefully at all the video evidence, it makes perfect sense," said Hall of Fame representative Jarrod Malcolm, who also found audio evidence of Cubs bench players taunting Ruth about his lack of astronomy knowledge, and not his size, as was previously believed. "After the first strike of the at bat Ruth raised his right finger in the direction where Halley's comet appeared in 1910, and following the second strike, Ruth yelled to the Cubs dugout, '0.586 AU,' which is the exact measurement of Halley's Comet's perihelion. Ruth then considered the perturbations the comet typically sustains from other planets and pointed to center field, identifying the exact position of the comet's 1986 appearance." Malcolm added that on the next pitch Ruth happened to hit a home run.
