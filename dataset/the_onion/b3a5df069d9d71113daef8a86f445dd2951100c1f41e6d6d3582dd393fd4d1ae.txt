PHNOM PENH--Wiping blood from his hands as he spoke with reporters Monday, U.S. ambassador to Cambodia William E. Todd said that if memory served, the thing he just did is almost certainly covered under the provisions of diplomatic immunity. "While I would need to consult the exact wording of the 1961 Vienna Convention again to confirm, I'm fairly confident that if you examine sovereign treaty law you'll find that what I just did a few minutes ago cannot be defined as a prosecutable action," said the disheveled diplomat before changing his soiled shirt, washing his face and torso, and hoisting a full garbage bag into the trunk of his car. "Of course, in the rare event of a civil suit, the State Department may waive immunity, but persecution isn't taken in the vast majority of cases. That is my understanding, at least." The ambassador went on to tell reporters that, as far as he knew, even if they wanted to stop him, they couldn't.
