In an interview with David Frost, Paul McCartney rejected the long-lived allegations that John Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, caused the Beatles' breakup in 1970, stating that the band was already in the process of splitting up at the time.

Greg Coady * Door Installer "I bet whoever Ringo was banging did it." Alvin Randall * Cruise Ship Captain
