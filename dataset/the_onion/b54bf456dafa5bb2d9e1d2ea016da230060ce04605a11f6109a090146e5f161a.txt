While visiting southeastern Connecticut tourist attractions yesterday, Gov. Dan Malloy officially pardoned a 15-pound lobster at a Noank, CT restaurant and then released it into the Mystic River. What do think? "But if that lobster goes out and commits violent rape, it could cost this guy the next election." Blake Guenther * Intelligence Specialist "Sadly, when that lobster gets home, he's going to find an entire underwater town that's moved on without him." Shelly Woodson * Dancing Instructor "Finally, someone delivers on a campaign promise." Marques Opad * Ambulance Driver
