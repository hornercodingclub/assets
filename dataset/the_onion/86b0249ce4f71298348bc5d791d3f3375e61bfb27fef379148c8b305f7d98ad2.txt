Twenty-one people were treated for burns after they walked across hot coals as part of a four-day "Unleash the Power Within" event hosted by famed motivational speaker and self-help guru Tony Robbins last week. What do think? "This is the third course I've taken through the Learning Annex and honestly, I was more badly injured in the first two." Dirk Blosser * Cremator "Some cynics might question the purpose of all this, but the fact of the matter is that these people got off their butts, went out into the real world, and got seriously hurt, instead of just reading about it online." Kayleigh Skatvold * Kennel Manager "With Tony Robbins's help, they'll be back to trusting motivational gurus in no time." Keith Shevlin * Cavity Pump Operator
