SAN ANTONIO--Spurs center Tim Duncan sent an e-mail with the subject heading "REMINDER! OPENING TIP-OFF COMING!!!" to all of his teammates Tuesday, urging them to keep Wednesday, Oct. 27, completely free because that is the night they play the Indiana Pacers in the 2010-2011 NBA season opener. "Please do not plan anything that entire day, as there will be a pregame meal, a mandatory pregame shoot around, warm-ups, and the game against the Indiana Pacers. Afterwards, plan on Coach Gregg Popovich addressing us in the team locker room for five to 10 minutes," Duncan's e-mail reads before going on to mention that he would be at the arena extra early to help with parking or anything else that might come up. "Remember, the game is at home at the AT&T Center. If you like, I can send you directions to the game based on the addresses I currently have on file. Please, if anything has changed, notify me." Explaining that he didn't want a repeat of last year's scheduling snafu, Duncan concluded the message by reminding his teammates that the Spurs haven't played in the Alamodome since 2002.
