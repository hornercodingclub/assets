IOWA CITY, IA--According to a report released Wednesday by the University of Iowa, 87 percent of Americans are currently unaware that they have been selected in the later rounds of the 2015 Major League Baseball Draft. "Our survey indicates that over 270 million Americans are totally oblivious to the fact that they've been picked between the 20th and 40th rounds of this year's MLB Draft and are now eligible to negotiate minor-league contracts," said study author Angelo Crawford, explaining that over four-fifths of the U.S. populace, many of whom never played baseball past Little League, have no idea that their names were recently displayed on the MLB.com live draft tracker as their selections were analyzed by numerous baseball writers and sports bloggers. "For example, several hundred thousand Americans are now part of the Baltimore Orioles organization and have been assigned to the Single-A Delmarva Shorebirds over in Maryland--they just don't know it." At press time, over 7 million Americans were ignoring a phone call from an unknown number belonging to Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane.
