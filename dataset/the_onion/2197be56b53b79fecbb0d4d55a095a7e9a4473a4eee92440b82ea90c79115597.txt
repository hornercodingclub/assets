FARMINGTON, NM--Providing an opportunity to rethink the decision to leave the social media site for good, a Facebook prompt reading "You're deleting your account? We'll be sad to see you go" appeared on user Emily Feldman's computer screen Friday and showed her a photo of her own dead body. "Your family and friends will miss you," the notification continued as the site displayed an increasingly disturbing slideshow of photos depicting Feldman's weeping, distraught loved ones surrounding her corpse and watching in agony as her body rots and eventually disappears, just as if she had never existed in the first place. "Your 709 friends will no longer be able to keep in touch with you. Do you still want to continue?" In one final message, Facebook suggested account deactivation as an alternative that would allow Feldman to return to the site and make all this horror and pain go away.
