To draw attention to the vulnerabilities of flight control systems, a security consultant created an app for his Android phone that lets him remotely seize control of a jetliner's autopilot function, potentially allowing him to alter its flight path or crash the plane. What do think? "What kind of social media integration does it have? Because I wouldn't want Facebook flooding everyone's news feed every time I crash a plane." Kent Van Zant *  Liquor Store Clerk "I'm fine with this being publicly available as long as people agree to only alter the flight path and never crash the plane." Jimmy Shelton  * Cylinder Checker "Did he make one of those apps where he says it's free but then bombards you with ads? It's like, I'd rather just pay the 99 cents." Buffy Yee * Systems Analyst
