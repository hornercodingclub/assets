Online payment service PayPal has struck a deal with 15 brick-and-mortar retailers, including JCPenney and Barnes and Noble, that will enable users to pay for merchandise with their phones. What do think? "Finally, the ease of paying for something online combined with the inconvenience of having to lug it around." Matthew Dick * Bath Mix Operator "Sweet. Now if I just sell 20 more lots of hotel soap on eBay I can waltz into Penney's and finally buy that pack of socks I've had my eye on." Sadie Cowper * Rope-Machine Setter "I guess since I can't afford a phone that means I don't have to pay at all! Yay!" Bill Francks * Office-Chair Assembler
