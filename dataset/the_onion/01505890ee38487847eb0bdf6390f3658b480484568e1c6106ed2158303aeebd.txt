LOS ANGELES--According to team sources, Clippers power forward Blake Griffin was left in total shock and despair Wednesday after walking in on teammate Chris Paul throwing lobs to power forward Lamar Odom. "We've been together for two years, and I didn't think we had any real problems on the frontcourt--I just can't believe he'd do this to me," said Griffin, who after a recent practice stumbled upon Paul standing at the free-throw line while a clearly embarrassed Odom hung from the rim in stunned silence. "I really thought he only had eyes for me when flipping the ball up for a huge jam. I guess I was wrong." At press time, Paul was reportedly outside the team's locker room desperately pleading with Griffin to "just come out and talk."
