CINCINNATI--Calling it the perfect choice for consumers looking to add some tartness to their laundry, Procter and Gamble on Tuesday unveiled a new sour apple Tide detergent pod. "These new stain fighters have the same deep-cleaning formula you've come to expect from Tide along with an extra burst of mouth-puckering fruit flavor," said spokeswoman Amy Gibson, explaining that each pod is equipped with patented Odor Defense technology as well as a sugar coating that adds just a touch of sweetness to the sour apple tang. "The multi-chamber design keeps the key ingredients of detergent, color protector, and a bubble gum center separated until the pod dissolves in the wash. It's like a trip to the laundromat and the candy store all at once!" Gibson went on to say that while the pods were only scheduled for limited release, they could be added to the permanent line of Tide products along with the s'mores stain-removing pen and the birthday cake detergent with bleach.
