MURFREESBORO, TN--Saying it was potentially disruptive to an educational environment in which all were entitled to see his rock-hard abs, administrators at Merritt High School suspended hunky senior Ryan Magnuson Wednesday for wearing a shirt. "When a teacher noticed that the shirt was obscuring the view of his shoulders, pecs, and the rest of his muscular torso, the student in question was sent to the office and ordered to remove the inappropriate garment," said assistant principal Janet Norcross, citing the school's zero-tolerance policy for students who've got the goods but refuse to flaunt them. "The student handbook makes perfectly clear what we expect of our beefcakes, and we expect them to comply." Norcross added that Magnuson was initially given the option of turning his shirt inside out, as long as he did it nice and slow.
