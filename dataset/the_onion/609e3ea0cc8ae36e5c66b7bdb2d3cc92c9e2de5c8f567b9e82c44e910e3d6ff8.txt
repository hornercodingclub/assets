WASHINGTON--Rushing toward the president as he pressed the eight-inch bit into his temple, several White House aides managed to wrestle a drill from Donald Trump's hand Monday while he attempted to remove Obama's listening device from his skull. "Obama implanted a microphone inside my head to record everything I say!" Trump reportedly shouted shortly before three White House staffers pinned him to the floor and pried apart his fingers to seize the power tool. "You don't understand, he can hear everything we're saying! Obama can even hear my thoughts! I have to get it out! I can feel it! I can feel it! I can feel it!" At press time, staffers were panicking after Trump locked himself in the bathroom and began cutting his stomach open with a razor blade in an attempt to find the tracking chip he said had put in his food.
