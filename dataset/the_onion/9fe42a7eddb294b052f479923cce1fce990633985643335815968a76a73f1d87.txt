LAS VEGAS--The Las Vegas Hotel & Casino sports book released a slate of new odds on the upcoming NFL season Monday, listing the Oakland Raiders as a 60-to-1 long shot to finish all 16 games this year. "Frankly, I think these odds are generous for a team that seems like it will be lucky to reach its bye week," said Vegas insider Rick Malik. "You've got an inexperienced quarterback, a walking injury of a running back, and then honestly name another player on this roster. Frankly, I would not be surprised if the Raiders are bounced out in week one." Bookmakers, however, placed 4-to-1 odds on the Raiders' entire draft class being a bust and a straight 2-to-1 line on the coaching staff being fired before season's end.
