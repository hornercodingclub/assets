NEW YORK--Bored and looking for something to do during his 19th season as MLB commissioner, Bud Selig decided Thursday that he would move the Arizona Diamondbacks to the American League West for the 2010 season. "I figured, ah, why not, you know?" a distracted and disinterested Selig told reporters, saying that implementing the league switch would be a decent way to kill time. "If it doesn't work out, we can switch it back halfway through the season. Whatever." Selig went on to announce that, just for the hell of it, Indians outfielder Grady Sizemore would be banned from baseball for life.
