SARASOTA, FL--Fulfilling a promise they made one year ago, nostalgic MLB pitchers and catchers reported to the exact same spot Thursday to recount memories of what many of them called "the best spring training ever." "Oh my God, you guys, I can't believe we're here. Let's see if that Gatorade bottle with the notes we wrote to each other is still buried under the pitcher's mound," said the visibly giddy Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, adding that everyone at camp looked older, but "in, like, a good way." "Would you look at us? We're all so different. Zack [Greinke] is an award winner now, and Roy [Halladay] is a Phillie. Wow. Let's promise to make this spring training even better than last year's spring training." Despite all the emotional and professional changes many of the players had gone through in the past year, all agreed they were there to do one thing, which was pitching and catching.
