LOS ANGELES--Curt Menefee, host of Fox's successful pregame show Fox NFL Sunday, received a stern warning from studio executives Monday for his failure to razz analyst Terry Bradshaw on at least six separate occasions during Sunday's broadcast. "Our award-winning NFL coverage is founded upon three central tenets: covering every angle, breaking every story, and really giving it to Terry about his bald head or dopey accent," said Fox Sports CEO David Hill, who later confirmed that James Brown's refusal to make fun of Bradshaw's lack of intelligence played a role in the former host's release. "Curt needs to shape up a little and remember that he's a journalist with a job to do." When asked for comment on the matter, Menefee released a statement of apology and admitted that he "spaced out a bit Sunday...kind of like Michael Strahan's front teeth."
