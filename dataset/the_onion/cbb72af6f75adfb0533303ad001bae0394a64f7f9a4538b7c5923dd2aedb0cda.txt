BOSTON--After fellow students at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth expressed surprise at Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev's alleged role in last week's fatal attack, a shocked Tsarnaev told reporters today that his classmates had always seemed like they were excellent judges of character. "When I first read in the paper that my classmates thought I was 'a really nice kid,' I was stunned," said Tsarnaev, emphasizing that "not in a million years" would he have suspected that his fellow undergraduates might turn out to be the types of people who would not notice that there was something deeply wrong with Tsarnaev. "I mean, they always seemed like such intelligent, perceptive individuals, but then you learn that they thought I was a normal, friendly, charismatic guy. It's incomprehensible." Tsarnaev added that it "just goes to show you never know with some people."
