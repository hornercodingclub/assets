WILBRAHAM, MA--Saying she would be thrilled to babysit for a couple days, area grandmother Margie Callahan has offered to watch her two grandchildren while their parents spend a weekend desperately trying to revive their marriage, sources reported Monday. "It'll be great to have little Ethan and Emma come stay over with Pop-Pop and I," said Callahan, who explained that she could bake cookies with the children, take them to the zoo, and watch with them during the 48-hour window in which her daughter and son-in-law will visit a nearby resort and spa in an attempt to salvage any romantic feelings that may still exist between them. "We'll find lots of fun things to do. You two just go enjoy yourselves and don't worry about us." Callahan's daughter then reportedly thanked her, adding that if something came up with the kids while she and her husband were away frantically searching for what, if anything, they still find attractive and worthwhile about each other, they would be just a phone call away.
