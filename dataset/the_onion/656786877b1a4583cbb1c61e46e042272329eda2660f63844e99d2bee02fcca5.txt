PALO ALTO, CA--In an effort to address numerous claims of compromised privacy, Onion Social announced plans Wednesday to offer a free medium T-shirt to anyone who has been a victim of stalking on the website. "The welfare of our users remains Onion Social's top priority, and we hope those who have felt unsafe on our site will accept a complimentary medium short-sleeved tee as a gesture of goodwill," said Onion Social spokesperson Melissa Stroud, touting the unisex T-shirts' breathable cotton-polyester blend and comfortable box-cut shape. "If you have been harassed, threatened, or stalked on Onion Social, please post your address and phone number on your newsfeed and we will mail this apology shirt directly to your home. If you would like the T-shirt in a different size, we recommend either shrinking it in the wash or really pulling on it to stretch it out." At press time, Onion Social had already run out of T-shirts and was offering victimized users a plain black keychain.
