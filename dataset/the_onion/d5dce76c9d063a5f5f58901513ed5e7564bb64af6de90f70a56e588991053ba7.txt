Barack Obama will be the first U.S. president to visit the Japanese city of Hiroshima, though the White House has clarified that there will be no formal apology issued during his stay for America's 1945 bombing of the city. What do think? "I hope he finds what he's looking for. Closure is so important." Brianna Lange * Timetable Drawer "Of course he shouldn't apologize. If we did that for every U.S.-involved attack on innocent people, we'd be stuck consoling loved ones forever." Brady Tyson * Door Holder "If he has some time to kill, he should definitely take in a Toyo Carp baseball game." Henry Zuiker * Guerrilla Marketer
