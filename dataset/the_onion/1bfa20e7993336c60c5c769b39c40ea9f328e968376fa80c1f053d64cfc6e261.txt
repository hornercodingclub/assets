The Crystal Cathedral, the Orange County, CA megachurch started by televangelist Robert Schuller, has been sold to an investment group so the church can restructure its debt. What do think? "Not surprised the Crystal Cathedral is bankrupt. I only go into megachurches if I want to pick up a little affirmation or need a few Bible verses." Keith LaBoe * Ware Tester "Since Rev. Schuller stopped broadcasting, I've discovered Rabbi Leibowitz and the Diamond Synagogue are better at fulfilling my spiritual needs." Elizabeth Viner * De-Alcoholizer "My prayers have been answered! Someone talked to me today! Thanks!" Gerry Epps * Unemployed
