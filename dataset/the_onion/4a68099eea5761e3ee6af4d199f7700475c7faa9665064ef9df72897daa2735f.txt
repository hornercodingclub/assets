New York City mayor Bill de Blasio spoke out this week against Times Square's , topless women covered in body paint who charge money for photos, saying they should be regulated the same way other street solicitors are. What do think? "I think another few coats of body paint would be a fine compromise." Hal Whitman * Motivational Speaker "I'm fine with the status quo. The last thing Times Square needs is a new type of person." Felicia Strunk * Charity Advocate "This is nothing more than burdensome government regulations putting struggling entrepreneurs out of business." Mason Brooks * Pipe Fitter
