JOHNSTOWN, PA--Saying it was the only factor he considered when deciding who to cast his ballot for, local man William Swanson, 44, told reporters Thursday he is strictly a single-gender voter. "There's really just one gender that matters to me when I'm in that voting booth," said Swanson, noting that he always takes the time to learn the candidates' genders before making a final decision. "Honestly, nothing else about them is going to change my vote. If they don't have the gender I'm looking for, I just can't support them--it's as simple as that. It's how I've always voted." Swanson added he was very impressed by what he'd seen from the Republican nominee, and believed the candidate could make great strides in advancing the gender he cares about so much.
