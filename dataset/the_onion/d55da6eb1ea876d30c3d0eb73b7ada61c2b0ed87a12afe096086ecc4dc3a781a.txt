NEW YORK--After spending a casual afternoon together playing a day game, the New York Mets approached the Philadelphia Phillies as they waited outside the ballpark for their team bus and asked them if they'd like to come back up to their field for a nightcap. "I know you've got an early flight tomorrow, but one more baseball game never hurt anyone," Mets third baseman David Wright said to the entire Phillies ballclub, flashing a smile and noting that Shea Stadium "looks beautiful under the lights." "No pressure, I just thought it might be...you know, fun." Despite the Mets' high hopes for the evening's nightcap, however, the Phillies did not allow them to get as far as third base.
