Sandwich chain Jimmy John's has been requiring employees to sign a non-compete clause prohibiting them from making sandwiches at competing restaurants that sell "submarine, hero-type, deli-style, pita and/or wrapped or rolled sandwiches" in order to safeguard trade secrets. What do think? "You can't be too careful when you've got a sandwich called 'Totally Tuna.'" Kara Webster * Strap Fastener "The sandwich biz is cutthroat. You can come out with a great new sub on Monday, and by the end of the week it's already been reverse-engineered by your competitors." Sam Patrick * Seasonal Goods Stocker "They left a pretty big loophole open for employees who want to make hoagies, grinders, or po' boys." Ben Gutierrez * Badge Issuer
