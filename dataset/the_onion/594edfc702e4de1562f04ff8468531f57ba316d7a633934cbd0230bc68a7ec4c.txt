WILLIAMSPORT, PA--After defeating a Japanese team 2-1 to win the Little League World Series, the 12-year-old champions from Huntington Beach, CA are, without a doubt, up to their ears in pussy, sources reported Friday. "They win the biggest game on the biggest stage--there's no way they're leaving the house without wading hip-deep in trim," said LLWS color commentator Orel Hershiser, adding that every member of the team is probably getting his own wet right now. "The second a woman finds out she's talking to a Little League World Series champ, she gets all flushed and will basically do anything. I'm talking the nastiest of stuff. With all that puss in their faces, I just hope those kids can breathe." Current major-league player and former Little League World Series winner Jason Varitek told reporters he got more pussy after winning the 1984 championship than at any other point in his life, and said the kids should just enjoy it while it lasts.
