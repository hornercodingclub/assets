JERUSALEM--While touring Israel's "Iron Dome" all-weather missile defense system Wednesday, President Barack Obama sarcastically asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu where he got all the money to build such technologically advanced equipment. "Boy, you've gotta have some pretty deep pockets to afford something like this--how much did you say this ran you guys?" asked Obama, who later added that the cutting-edge system designed to intercept both short and long-range missiles must have "cost Israel an arm and a leg." "I mean, wow. I didn't know you guys had this much in the old war chest, but apparently you do. Really, really impressive stuff. No wonder you're so independent." Sources say Obama's sarcastic comments came after facetiously asking how much money Israel's warplanes set them back, at which point Obama cut Netanyahu off and said, "I know exactly how much."
