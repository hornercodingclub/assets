ARTESIA, NM--Still shaken after a surprise encounter with the 37-year-old educator, local first- grader Micah Dunn was reportedly weirded out Tuesday after bumping into his teacher outside of his laptop. "Mrs. Evans was walking around without moving out of frame--it was super weird," said Dunn, who recalled feeling dumbfounded after a recent trip to the grocery store in which he spotted the woman standing in line occupying three-dimensional space. "She looked 10 times bigger than she normally does on screen, and had a baby with her that was also in 3D. I was so confused. I can't believe she has a whole entire body. I guess it makes sense that she would live outside my computer, but I'm still surprised. I can't wait to FaceTime my friends about this." At press time, Dunn added that though the experience was strange, he was comforted by the familiar sight of his teacher glitching.
