CLEVELAND--Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam urged unhappy fans Tuesday to continue to support the team through at least the end of the season. "I know this has been unenjoyable, but back in the summer you guys made a commitment," said Haslam, adding that if Browns fans really wanted to give up after the season was finally over that was a choice he could at least respect. "You've already stuck with it for this long, so with only a couple games left, why not just gut it out? I mean, come on, you think you're the only ones who've thought about quitting?" Haslam then added to reporters that if fans were going to just half-ass it the rest of the way, he'd rather they just quit and get the fuck out of his sight.
