TROY, NY--A word search puzzle featured on the back of a Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats box is just about fucking impossible, local man Glenn McCurdy confirmed Thursday. "Jesus Christ, why can't I fucking do this?" said McCurdy, 34, referring to the impenetrable 10-letter by 10-letter grid, which reportedly includes such words as "breakfast," "milk," and "fun." "I've been at it for almost an hour, and even the ones I got were some kind of fucking miracles. I mean, it looks like some of these words are in there backwards. Who the hell do they think I am? Bill fucking Gates?" At press time, a frustrated McCurdy had torn apart the cereal box to access the answers printed on the inside.
