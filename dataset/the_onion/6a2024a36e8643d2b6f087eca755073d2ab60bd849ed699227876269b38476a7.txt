Google announced Tuesday it will officially enable an "unsend" button for Gmail that allows users to set a five- to 30-second grace period after hitting "send" on an email to rescind that email, which should help users who accidentally hit "reply all" or send an email impulsively and want to take it back.

Mary Felton * Egg Scrambler "I'm flattered they think I can realize I've made a horrible mistake in just 30 seconds." Richie Fry * Line Producer
