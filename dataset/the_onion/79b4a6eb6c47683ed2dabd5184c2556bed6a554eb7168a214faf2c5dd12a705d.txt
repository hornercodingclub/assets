Hillary Clinton said she is sorry for her use of a personal email account to conduct business as Secretary of State, a scandal that is currently under investigation by the FBI and for which she had previously refused to apologize. What do think? "Smart move. She nipped that in the bud before it could get out of hand." Nicolas Dempsey * Fence Painter "If Hillary backs down on issues like these, how can we expect her to be a strong, deceptive presidential candidate?" Marco Ballard * Camp Director "I can tell by the way she held on to that apology for so long that she truly meant it." Fiona Wexler * Yarn Spinner
