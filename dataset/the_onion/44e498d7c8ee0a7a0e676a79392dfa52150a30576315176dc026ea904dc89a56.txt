MINNEAPOLIS--The scrappy Minnesota Twins continued to claw and fight their way down to the bottom of the standings last Wednesday, stringing together the league's longest losing streak with their 11th-straight defeat. "This team has a lot of resolve, and we will battle tooth and nail for last place until the season is over," said right fielder Jason Kubel, who has helped to lead the team with crucial defensive lapses and ineffectiveness at the plate. "We've got a lot of spunk. I don't care who we are playing. We'll do whatever it takes and find some way to lose." Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said the team was slumping at the right time and might end up with the worst record in the majors if they continued to play their brand of shit ball.
