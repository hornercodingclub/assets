NEW YORK--Moments before launching into a long diatribe about the 2013 NFL Draft's top defensive backs, writer Peter King's wife Ann reportedly told her husband she wanted a divorce, sources confirmed on Thursday. "Peter, it's over; I want a divorce," said Ann, packing her suitcase as her husband momentarily paused and then explained that Dee Milliner and David Amerson can provide solid run support for any team that needs it, that Jonathan Banks' lanky frame doesn't mean he's not one of the most physical guys in this entire draft, and that if you're looking for a tough corner with solid cover skills, you won't get much better than Washington's Desmond Trufant. "Listen, Peter, I don't want to hear about this right now." As his wife left the house and closed the door, reports confirmed that King was talking incessantly about the natural athleticism of Texas safety Kenny Vaccaro.
