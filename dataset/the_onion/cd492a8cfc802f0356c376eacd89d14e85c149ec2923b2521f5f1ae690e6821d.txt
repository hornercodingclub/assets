CALGARY--During their three-game road swing last month, the Columbus Blue Jackets players could not stop gushing about the impressive architecture, diverse shopping opportunities, friendly people, and fascinating history they discovered in the city of Calgary. "I've really never seen anything quite like it," second-year player Gilbert Brule said while snapping photographs of the Sunridge Mall's TCBY, Spencer Gifts, and Radio Shack. "I feel like it would take me a lot longer to run out of things to say or do here than in Columbus." The Blue Jackets also discussed their dread of an upcoming two-week homestand while trying on hats at TJ Maxx, agreeing they should enjoy Calgary's urban, cosmopolitan pleasures while they could.
