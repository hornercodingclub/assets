CHICAGO--Racking his brain to come up with what he felt were the most natural and appropriate reactions, local man Jeff Stadler was reportedly forced to come up with 45 seconds' worth of varied facial expressions Friday as his server at Superior Seafood Grill listed off the restaurant's daily specials. "We have a seared yellowfin tuna, which is served on a bed of fresh micro greens with a wasabi vinaigrette, as well as a pappardelle pasta with salmon and roasted asparagus," said Stadler's waitress, while the 36-year-old financial analyst strung together a series of half-smiles, raised eyebrows, and thoughtful looks that he believed were suitable for each of the establishment's featured entrees and sides. "And all of the specials have the option of being accompanied by a garden salad or the soup du jour, which is a lobster bisque." At press time, sources confirmed that a depleted Stadler could only come up with a furrowed brow and a slight nod of his head when his waitress launched into an additional 30-second description of the restaurant's selection of artisanal cocktails.
