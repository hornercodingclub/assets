BRISTOL, CT--The ABC Sports family extended its attempt to offer alternative coverage of major sporting events by using miniaturized cameras and microphones to broadcast Tuesday night's NBA Finals Game 6 from the perspective of ABC studio team member Dan Patrick live on ESPN2. "Excuse me... Pardon me... Sorry," Patrick can be heard to say during the tip-off and first three minutes of the game, narrating HDTV-quality first-person shots of exactly what Patrick saw as he hurried to his third-row seat after wrapping up the pregame show. "Okay, Miami, let's see if you can get this ratings-killer of a series over with." ESPN2 has not said whether they would repeat their "Dan PatrickVision" experiment in future broadcasts, saying fans were "intrigued but not enthusiastic" about the long shots of Patrick checking his cell-phone messages, the frequent quick pans to the unnamed blonde woman sitting behind Patrick's left shoulder, or the comb that obscured the on-court action as it passed in front of the camera roughly every 45 seconds.
