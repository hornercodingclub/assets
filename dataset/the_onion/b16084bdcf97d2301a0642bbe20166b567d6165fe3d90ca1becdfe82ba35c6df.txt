NEW YORK--A coalition of network-news executives made an appeal to breast-cancer researchers Monday, urging them to release any new findings about the disease in time for May sweeps. "It is imperative that we have the latest information about the war against breast cancer," ABC News executive Andrew Diehl said. "Without it, we will be unable to educate the American people, or show ratings-grabbing stock footage of women in backless hospital gowns getting mammograms." Magazine editors are supporting the appeal, as well. "Our recent breast-cancer cover story--which featured a picture of a woman's naked torso with a hand cupping the breast-was our biggest seller this year," managing editor Fred Case said. " is fully committed to providing top-notch, full-color coverage of this dread disease." The network executives also urged scientists to step up research on possible new forms of cancer, including inner-thigh cancer and ass cancer.
