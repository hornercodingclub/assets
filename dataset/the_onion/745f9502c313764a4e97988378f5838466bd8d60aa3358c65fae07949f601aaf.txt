STROUDSBURG, PA--Saying the middle-aged man had adopted a devout life of piety seemingly out of nowhere, acquaintances of local resident Paul D'Amato reported Friday that the reason he was turning to religion later in life must be completely horrifying. "He just started going to church for the very first time a couple months ago even though he's 49 years old, and now he wears a cross and everything--boy, you've got to think it was something pretty terrible that made him religious at this point," said coworker Jessica Redmond, who explained that because D'Amato was all of a sudden attending multiple services per week and now often peppers his conversations with mentions of the light that Jesus provides to his life, the cause of his religious awakening was almost certainly "really, really bad." "The guy's nearly 50, and he finds God right out of the blue? I bet it's something with drugs. Or maybe he killed someone in a car accident. Either way, something super messed up happened to him." At press time, speculation about D'Amato's circumstances had grown more rampant after sources confirmed he had volunteered to read a passage from Ephesians about forgiveness and redemption during last week's services at the local Presbyterian church.
