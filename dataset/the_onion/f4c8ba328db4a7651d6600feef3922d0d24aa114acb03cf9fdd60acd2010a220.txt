LONDON--Members of the Royal Family confirmed today that, following his morning feeding, the crown's spit up on his great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. "Elizabeth took the little hiccup lovingly in stride," said an anonymous palace aide, adding that she had a "marvelous sense of humor about the episode." "The Queen is devoted to her great-grandson and understands that babies will be babies. She wouldn't dream of missing these early moments with him." The aide added that the Queen's outfit was mildly stained.
