NEW YORK--Confusion, disgust, and terror were among the emotions new Jets quarterback Tim Tebow reported feeling after a 20-minute phone call with New York coach Rex Ryan. "Coach Ryan is a very...expressive person. Really descriptive. He can be a little vulgar, though," the visibly distraught Tebow told reporters while attempting to hold a glass of ice water steady enough to drink from it. "He told me what he wants the Jets to do next year. Then he told me I'd like New York, and why. Then he told me about, about the 'fun' we are all going to have together. That was most of the call. I have to go now. I have to call my parents. I have to be alone for a while." Coach Ryan said he enjoyed talking with Tebow, whom he described as "a nice, quiet kid with a good head for football who gasps a lot when you talk about poontang."
