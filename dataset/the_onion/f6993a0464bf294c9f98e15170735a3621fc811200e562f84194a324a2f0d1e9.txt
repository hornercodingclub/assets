FLORHAM PARK, NJ--Though some in the Jets organization have expressed doubts about Mark Sanchez's role as the team's starting quarterback, head coach Rex Ryan vociferously defended Sanchez Thursday, confirming the former first-round pick was "absolutely" the team's starter during the 2011-2012 season. "I know it's your guys' job to generate controversy, but I'm only going to say this once: Mark Sanchez was our quarterback this past season, and he will continue to be our quarterback this past season," said Ryan, who repeatedly called Sanchez "my guy last year." "I'm not going to stand here and listen to people ask if I am going to stick with Sanchez all last season, because I am. End of story." When asked if the Jets planned to acquire quarterback Peyton Manning in the offseason, Ryan said, "How many times do I have to tell you? Mark Sanchez is the heart and soul of the 2011-2012 Jets."
