GREENSBURG, IN--In an effort to brighten her afternoon and get herself through the tough first day of another week, area mother and account manager Anna Claremont, 43, reportedly tucked an affectionate, handwritten note into her own lunch bag Monday morning. "Hope you're having a relaxing day so far," read the loving note, which sources confirmed was nestled next to an apple, a small container of hummus, a bag of baby carrots, and several squares of dark chocolate she included as a "special little treat just for you." "Good luck on your presentation--Just be yourself and I just know you'll do great!" Reports also confirmed that Claremont got a kick out of the reverse side of the note, which contained her own amusing drawing of her cat.
