MUNCIE, IN--Shaking their heads in disgust at the irresponsible man's laziness and lack of initiative, sources disclosed to reporters Monday that impoverished 53-year-old Luke Reilly has never earned passive income from stock dividends a day in his life. "It's an absolute disgrace that there are people in this country who can't even be bothered to get up and go out and put some of their cash on hand into high dividend-yielding stocks," said local resident Deborah Nix, who expressed frustration at the full-time cashier's refusal to even try investing in a mutual fund or placing a substantial inheritance into an account that generates thousands of dollars a year and can then be tapped into as needed. "He probably just expects everything to be handed to him, but that's not how it works. You have to get out there and pound the pavement until you find a reputable wealth management firm. Then, it's just a matter of following the advice of an expert and transferring funds from one place to another. Of course, if someone like that ever receive a dividend payout or a generous share buyback, he'd probably blow it all by the end of the week." At press time, sources confirmed Reilly had proven his neighbor's point by squandering his entire minimum-wage paycheck on rent, bills, and groceries.
