GRESHAM, OR--Underscoring the benefits of working for a laid-back company like SocialFire Marketing, founder and CEO Matt Avalon told reporters Tuesday he had instituted an office-wide policy permitting employees to work from home anytime after 6 p.m. "If it helps them be efficient and get more done, I have no problem with people working remotely once they've left the office for the day," said Avalon, who noted that as long as they're doing their jobs, the location where his staff members choose to work between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. is "completely up to them." "That's the kind of relaxed culture we strive to create here--one where you can even be working from your living room couch at two in the morning if you'd like." Avalon added that since they don't have to be in the office for any meetings, employees are free to work from home on weekends and holidays as well.
