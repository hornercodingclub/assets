Featuring six plots woven together across five centuries, the Tom Hanks and Halle Berry movie , which is based on a David Mitchell novel long considered "unfilmable," opened to middling reviews and poor ticket sales. What do think? "Some said was unfilmable, too. Turned out it was." Kay Witt * Sound Mixer "You'd think audiences wouldn't be able to resist the daring originality of a big-budget sci-fi/fantasy epic with philosophical undertones." Nicholas Hartwick * Parole Officer "I was completely baffled by the trailer, so I watched the entire film hoping I'd understand it better, but I didn't, so then I read the book, which also didn't make any sense. So now I'm going to go back and watch the trailer again to see if I missed something." Rich Osment * Materials Engineer
