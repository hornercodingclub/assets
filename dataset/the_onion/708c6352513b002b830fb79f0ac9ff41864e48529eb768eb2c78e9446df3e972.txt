LAS VEGAS--Floyd Mayweather Sr., manager of prizefighter Oscar de la Hoya, announced yesterday that the cost of teaching de la Hoya how to beat up Floyd Mayweather Jr., the trainer's own flesh and blood, someone whom he helped bring into this world and someone he loves and cherishes more than anyone, would be $2 million. "Listen, if Oscar were fighting my cousin or even my brother, I would take $1 million easy. But this is my son we're talking about," said Mayweather, adding that years ago, before he tucked his son into bed every night, he told him he loved him so much that he would always be there to protect him unless he was paid $2 million to do otherwise. "I'm like Abraham, and my son is like Isaac. And Oscar de la Hoya, if he pays me $2 million, will retain his WBC welterweight title." Mayweather added that for $3 million he would slip downers in his son's water bottle between rounds.
