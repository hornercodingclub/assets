NEW YORK--Describing it as an opportunity for the comics to try out their new material, the Comedy Cellar on Monday reportedly launched a new live show for male comedians to workshop their sexual harassment apologies. "Our new show offers a dozen comics--from young up-and-comers to seasoned professionals--a chance to try out the sexual harassment apologies they've been working on in front of a receptive crowd," said Comedy Cellar spokesman Leonard Childress, adding that the show, which will run weekly, gives each male comedian a 10-minute slot to experiment with different admissions of guilt and try out new expressions of remorse that they can use in their future explanations. "These comics can just throw any justifications for their behavior and promises to change against the wall and see what sticks. There's no judgment here. After all, you want to be confident that you have your sharpest, tightest apology ready when you finally go out to present it to the media." At press time, the audience was abuzz after finding out that comedian Andy Dick was dropping in to workshop some brand-new material.
