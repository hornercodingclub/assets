LOS ANGELES--The professional basketball world was left reeling as reports surfaced Tuesday that Los Angeles Clippers power forward Blake Griffin has been caught plagiarizing several of his slam dunks. "We have heard these accusations, and let me assure you that they are receiving our full attention," said Clippers general manager Gary Sacks, referring to allegations that the former Rookie of the Year stole several iconic dunks from other players without properly crediting them--most egregiously a two-handed overhand slam from the low post recorded in a Jan. 4, 2012 game against the Houston Rockets that experts call a "carbon copy" of a similar dunk previously executed by Chicago Bulls forward Carlos Boozer. "If Blake is found to have in fact stolen these dunks--and we are still making every effort to determine if his rim position, angle of approach, and hang time were in fact lifted from other athletes--then we will hold him fully responsible for his misdeeds. Dunk plagiarism lately has become a black eye for this league, and it is not something our organization takes lightly." A visibly agitated Griffin reportedly insisted that the only borrowed components of his jams were those taken from public domain slam dunks by such NBA legends as Bob Pettit, Dave DeBusschere, and Elvin Hayes.
