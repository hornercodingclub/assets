LOS ANGELES--Surpassing levels not seen since the mid-1980s, a new report published Monday by UCLA found that dance cage recidivism is at an all-time high within America's club scene. "We're seeing more and more people leave the cage only to find themselves right back inside not even a weekend later, gyrating once again in a seemingly inescapable cycle," said the study's lead author, Dr. Abby Meehan, adding that she had met dancers who had been in and out of cages so many times, they actually preferred moving their bodies behind bars than out on the floor with the general party population. "Unfortunately for many, it's the only nightlife they know. And the sad thing is that the club system is designed to keep them in there for as many extended remixes as possible, often in cramped conditions with barely any room to grind or shake their asses at all." Meehan went on to say that early intervention is crucial, as a 50-year-old in a dance cage is almost certainly beyond rehabilitation.
