BROOKLYN, NY--Explaining that the prisoners dole out their own form of brutal justice, prison officials at the Metropolitan Detention Center told reporters Thursday that Martin Shkreli faces a rough stay in a system where inmates who funded hair theft are considered the lowest caste. "As soon as word spreads you're in here for soliciting stolen hair, you've got a target on your back," said prison warden Joe Ferrero, noting that most inmates see someone like the former pharmaceutical company CEO, who offered $5,000 cash in exchange for procuring one of Hillary Clinton's hairs, as "the scum of the earth." "The showers, the yard, even their own cell at night--these hair-bounty guys aren't safe anywhere. Shkreli's life will be a living hell. He'll be lucky if they don't slit his throat in a week." Ferrero went on to say that while he was not proud of the fact, many guards were known to turn a blind eye to the torment of notorious hair collectors such as Shkreli.
