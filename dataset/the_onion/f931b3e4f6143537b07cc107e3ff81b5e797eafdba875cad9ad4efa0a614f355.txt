British actor Ed Skrein has quit the "Hellboy" reboot after objections to his being cast as a supporting character depicted as Asian in the original comics. What do think? "It's high time Hollywood started casting more minorities in small supporting roles." Tracy Hebel * Replay Editor "Good. Hellboy deserves a sidekick who doesn't cut and run at the first sign of social media outrage." Jack Wigfield * Balloon Pilot "I honestly don't care who they put in movies as long as they're sexy enough to make me forget my boring life for two hours." Ryan Weyandt * Cigar Filler
