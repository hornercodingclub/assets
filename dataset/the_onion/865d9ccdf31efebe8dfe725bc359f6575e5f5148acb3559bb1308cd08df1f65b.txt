ST. PAUL, MN--Front-office officials for the popular minor-league St. Paul Saints baseball team called their decision to name Monday "Kill Your Children Night" an "egregious mistake" and "a rousing attendance success" after Twin Cities families took advantage of the team's offer to take $5 off adult ticket prices for every child they kill in the parking lot. "After all the crazy promotions we at the Saints have held over the years, we know one thing for certain: People will do anything for cheap baseball tickets," Saints marketing manager Bill Silberklang said. "We expected one or two infanticides, sure, but this... This may be the worst thing to happen in quirky baseball promotion since Disco Demolition Night." Team officials have apologized to the community for encouraging them to murder their children, and said that the attendance record set that same night would forever be marked with an asterisk in the team's media guide.
