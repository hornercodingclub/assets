IRVINE, CA--Just two weeks after being laid off from the tech firm where he worked as a coder, 34-year-old Sam Morrison told sources Monday that he had finally achieved the perfect work-life balance. "It's been great; this new schedule allows me to spend more time with my wife and kids, get together with friends, and I can even squeeze in a few hours of TV here and there--I've finally found the mix of career and personal life that works for me," explained the stress-free man, who credited the shift to helping him get on a regular sleep cycle and workout regimen for the first time in years. "Lately I'm feeling less overwhelmed, I'm more upbeat, and I'm finally writing again. It's really all about having good time management." As of press time, Morrison was doing yoga in his backyard as his mortgage payment became overdue.
