LOS ANGELES--Following the first public appearance of the actress formerly known as Mark Wahlberg at a Hollywood fundraiser last night, the American people acknowledged the and star's sex-reassignment surgery was something they had not seen coming. "Huh," said Illinois schoolteacher Thomas Granger, 37, reading about the star making her red-carpet debut as Martha Wahlberg. "I guess Mark Wahlberg's a woman now. He always seemed like more of a masculine guy. But good for him. I mean, her. It's just that, you know, the last time I saw him on TV, he was doing some promo work for that movie, and he didn't mention anything about this." Sources throughout the nation agreed that Wahlberg, despite the gender-change procedure, is still a looker.
