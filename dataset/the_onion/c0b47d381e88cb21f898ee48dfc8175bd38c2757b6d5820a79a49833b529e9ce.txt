OXFORD, OH--Sources confirmed Saturday that ESPN sideline reporter Laura Rutledge is acting like it is no big deal that Notre Dame football head coach Brian Kelly just walked away in the middle of their halftime interview. "What does the defense- oh, oh, thanks, coach," said Rutledge, who reportedly continued to smile resolutely toward the camera as if the coach had not just begrudgingly given a rushed, rote answer to her first question and then proceeded to storm off in the middle of her follow-up about the team bouncing back in the second half. "Back to you guys upstairs." At press time, Rutledge was pretending not to notice the stream of sweat pouring onto her from the player she was speaking with during a postgame interview.
