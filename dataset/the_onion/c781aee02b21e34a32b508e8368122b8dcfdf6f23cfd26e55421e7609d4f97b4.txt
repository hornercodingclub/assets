HOUSTON--Shocked that it was snug in the waist after only three months, area mom Donna Haversaw told reporters Friday that she couldn't believe her 10-year-old son had already outgrown his mobility scooter. "I know kids grow fast at this age, but geez! We've already let the handlebars out twice and the steering wheel is still digging into his stomach," said Haversaw, noting that the last time her son had tried squeezing in, a button had popped off. "These things aren't cheap, you know. We're not like some of those families who can afford to buy their child a brand new one every time he gains 30 pounds." Haversaw added that while it might be a little loose at first, for now her son would have to make do with his older brother's hand-me-down scooter.
