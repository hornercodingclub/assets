TAMPA, FL--NFL referee Bob Turner wishes he could find more time to be at home throwing a flag around with his 8-year-old son, the veteran official said Friday. "Every dad wants the chance to spend some quality time in the backyard with his kid, tossing a flag on the ground, but traveling across the country every week means I don't get to do that very often," said Turner, who fondly remembers throwing a flag around with his own referee father. "One of these days I'm going to come home from a Super Bowl, want to throw the flag on the grass with him, and he's not going to be a kid anymore." Turner also admitted he sometimes worries his absence will lead the boy to fall in with the wrong crowd, and dreads the thought of getting a call at 3 a.m. notifying him his son has been charged with a face-masking penalty.
