Former writer Mark Saltzman has backtracked on his comments that he wrote Bert and Ernie as a gay couple, stressing that he merely meant to say that his own experience as a gay man informed his writing while on the show.

Tyson Daugherty * Button Distributor "Good. Bert's constant bickering is less heartbreaking if they aren't a couple." Edmund Weber * Butterfly Catcher
