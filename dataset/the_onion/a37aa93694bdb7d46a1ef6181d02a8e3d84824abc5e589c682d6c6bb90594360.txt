DANVILLE, KY--Saying that he doesn't want any of "that crap made in foreign countries," local man Doug Adelwright, 47, confirmed Tuesday that he only buys products manufactured right here in the United States by underpaid immigrant laborers. "I always buy American, because I believe in supporting businesses that don't move their factories overseas and instead employ illegal migrant workers to make things here at home," said Adelwright, adding that you'll never see a "made in Bangladesh" tag inside any of his shirts, because his clothes are made exclusively under U.S. sweatshop conditions. "Why should I buy stuff made by exploited foreigners in another country when I can buy stuff made by exploited foreigners who work on American soil? Look, I don't want my purchasing dollars to go straight to some other country; I want my money going to good, honest workers here in the United States who then immediately send the money to their families back in other countries." Adelwright also told reporters that he would choose the craftsmanship of a human-trafficking victim smuggled into the United States over the craftsmanship of a worker in a foreign country "any day of the week."
