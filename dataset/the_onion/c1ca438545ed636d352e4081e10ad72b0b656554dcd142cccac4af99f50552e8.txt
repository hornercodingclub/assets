POCATELLO, ID--According to reports Tuesday from sources who said you'd get used to it eventually, that whole side of the family is just like that. "Oh, yeah, they're all like that. Always have been," said area father Bruce Mayer, noting that every one of them, from the oldest on down, was just a little off. "I mean, look at the parents--they're like that, so of course the kids are too. I know you only met one of them, but trust me, they're all pretty much cut from the same cloth." Mayer later clarified his remarks, acknowledging that Ron's sister Karen was actually kind of normal.
