WASHINGTON--Previewing tonight's televised primetime address to the nation, White House aides confirmed that President Obama will reassure Americans that the impending military campaign against ISIS will be the exact same type of open-ended, drawn-out conflict that they are used to. "The president recognizes that citizens may be uneasy about this operation, and that's why he will use tonight's speech to comfort the American public by reminding them that they have been through armed engagements without clear end dates or even concrete objectives plenty of times before, and that this case is no different," said senior White House advisor Daniel Pfeiffer, adding that the president will assuage viewers' concerns by laying out precisely how the U.S. will mire itself in the same old quagmire that citizens have grown accustomed to over the years. "The president's message is clear: This will be just another one of our routine intractable engagements in the region--it's going to be unending, it's going to be expensive, and it's going to affect our credibility within the international community. There will not be any surprises for folks to worry about." Pfeiffer added that by the end of Obama's speech, Americans should be able to rest easy and just let this situation play out like they know it will.
