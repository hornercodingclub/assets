WASHINGTON--After an NFL investigation revealed that 11 of New England's 12 game balls were under-inflated during last weekend's AFC Championship Game, Americans across the nation announced Wednesday that they would love--absolutely --to hear the excuses from Patriots fans this time. "No, no, by all means, go ahead," said every single person living outside of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island, and Connecticut before reportedly smiling and adding, "I'm all ears." "Wait, let me guess: The deflated footballs were also easier to catch for the Colts defense, so the Patriots didn't have a real advantage, right? Or is it that the score was so lopsided that it didn't matter in the end? No, seriously, I'm sure you guys have something really great cooked up for this one." The American populace went on to say that they also absolutely cannot wait to hear how this new scandal will have no effect on the legacy of Tom Brady.
