SANTA CLARA, CA--Following the team's 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50, every single member of the Denver Broncos organization officially announced their retirement Sunday. "To go out on top with a Super Bowl win, there's no better way to end our time in the league," read a joint statement released by quarterback Peyton Manning, general manager John Elway, head coach Gary Kubiak, all 22 assistant coaches, every executive in the Broncos' front office, and every player on the Broncos' roster, as well as the organization's trainers, equipment managers, scouting personnel, medical staff, executive assistants, marketing team, IT team, human resources department, receptionists, security guards, and janitors, and the Sports Authority Stadium at Mile High ushers, grounds crew, and food vendors. "It was a tough decision to make, but ultimately, we realized that we'd accomplished everything we set out to do, and we've got nothing left to prove. Not many people can say they were able to go out as Super Bowl champs." At press time, the Broncos had taken out a full-page ad in to say thanks and goodbye to all the fans in the city.
