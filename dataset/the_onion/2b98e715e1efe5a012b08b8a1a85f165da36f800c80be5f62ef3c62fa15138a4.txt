TAMPA BAY, FL--After losing 27-23 to the Steelers in a hard-fought Super Bowl, Arizona coach Ken Whisenhunt boldly addressed the Cardinals' detractors, lauding them for a correct prediction of a Steeler win. "They said our defense couldn't come through in a big spot, that we were too inexperienced, that [running back] Edge [Edgerrin James] was finished: right, right, and right. I only wish I had listened to them and not gotten my hopes up so high," said Whisenhunt, expressing satisfaction in proving doubters "right, but barely." "We heard all week about how there was no way we'd come out of there with a win, and then that's the way it happened. Bottom line, they were right and I was wrong." Whisenhunt then addressed those die-hard Cardinal fans who believed in the team all along, calling them "delusional" and "misguided."
