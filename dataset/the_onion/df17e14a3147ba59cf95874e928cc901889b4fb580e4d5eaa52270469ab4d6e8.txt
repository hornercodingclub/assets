Scientists in New Zealand have uncovered the fossils of a 5-foot-9-inch-tall, 223-pound penguin, which they speculate lived on Earth shortly after the age of the dinosaurs. What do think? "I thought I was the first living thing to be 5-foot-9 and 223 pounds." Chris Hooks * Systems Analyst "I suppose they were the equivalent of cute little penguins to the giant humans who roamed the earth at the same time." Sandra Nicholson * Potato Peeler "Always feels good to learn about new species that we've outlasted." Nathan Henry * Quail Carver
