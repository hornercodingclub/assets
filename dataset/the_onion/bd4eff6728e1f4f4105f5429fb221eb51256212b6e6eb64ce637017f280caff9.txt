ARNOLDS PARK, IA--Appearing at a campaign event in the early primary state, real estate mogul and presidential candidate Donald Trump told an assembled group of dairy farmers Monday that his cows were 500 times bigger than theirs. "Your cows are small and scrawny, and you should be embarrassed to milk them," said Trump, adding that each of his cows was the size of "at least" a dozen Cadillacs and had "udders that'll make your head spin." "No one raises dairy cows as gigantic or successful as I do; everyone knows that. My cattle are winners, and you people would be lucky to have them graze here." Chatting with patrons at a diner later in the day, Trump reportedly said the apple pie was a disgrace and that his pies were a mile wide, with a perfect crust that made all the losers jealous.
