WASHINGTON--Saying that, hey, it beats nothing, Americans across the nation expressed gratitude today that Shellie Dean Zimmerman, the Florida woman accused of lying to police about husband George Zimmerman's finances while he was imprisoned this year for the death of teenager Trayvon Martin, has been officially charged with perjury under state law. "Look, no matter how anything else turned out, Shellie Dean Zimmerman has still been charged with the offense of lying to authorities, so, justice served, right?" Maryland resident Abby Liptak told reporters on Monday, noting that while it's unfortunate George Zimmerman was found innocent over the weekend of murdering an unarmed black teenager, she's at least glad his wife will be tried for a third-degree felony. "So you thought you could get away with perjury, did you, Mrs. Zimmerman? Well, not so fast, Shellie--not so fast!" Liptak additionally told reporters that if Shellie Zimmerman is convicted on charges and gets even 12 or 13 months of probation, she'll consider the Trayvon Martin case closed.
