MINNEAPOLIS--Hoping to make a little extra money, former Minnesota Twins pitcher Scott Erickson placed his 1994 no-hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers up for sale on eBay Sunday. "It's 17 years old, but I guarantee this game is still 100% hitless," read the listing, which after four days online has received one bid of $4.75. "You get all five strikeouts, four walks, even the six runs my teammates put up in support. Trust me, this is truly a fine game to own." Erickson has set the no-hitter's Buy It Now price at $2,500.
