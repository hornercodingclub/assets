WASHINGTON--After yesterday's announcement that the president received a perfect score on his cognitive assessment, White House physician Ronny L. Jackson told reporters Wednesday that follow-up tests confirmed that President Trump's 19 other personalities are also perfectly healthy. "After an extensive psychological evaluation, we've determined that Tommy JoJo, Professor O'Shannassy, Officer Pittz, and each of the president's 16 other identities are in good condition," said Jackson, adding that each distinct psychic identity, from Little Holly Anne Tibblseby to DJ Pump 'Em Up, demonstrated robust mental acuity, emotional stability, and memory function. "Despite the advanced age of Ol' Jack the 70-year-old New York cabby and Civil War colonel Virgil Conway, none of President Trump's personalities exhibited signs of neurological deterioration. Even 3-year-old Jacky demonstrated the clarity and intellectual fitness required to handle the presidency." At press time, however, Jackson reported the emergence of a volatile Fred Trump personality, which was in a constant state of agitation and which left the president exhausted long after it returned control of his mind.
