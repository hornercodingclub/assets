OKLAHOMA CITY--Describing the atmosphere as the most daunting they have ever encountered, Clippers players expressed their utter terror and panic Tuesday night upon taking the floor against the Thunder and discovering every spectator in the arena wearing the same white T-shirt. "When I first saw that sea of white shirts out there, I just remember thinking, 'Oh my God, what have we gotten ourselves into here?'" said Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, noting that he and his teammates were absolutely crippled with fear after realizing the T-shirts worn by the Oklahoma City fans were not only the same color, but also had the same "Thunder" logo printed on the front. "Then they all started chanting "De-fense! De-fense!" while we had the ball, and we just didn't know what to do. We've played in hostile environments before, but that--I don't ever want to face that again." Following his team's loss, Clippers head coach Doc Rivers admitted to reporters that his players simply couldn't overcome the fans' wild cheers when the phrase "Let's Get Loud!" was displayed on the arena's Jumbotron.
