AUSTIN, TX--In the most recent of a long string of hobbies and obsessions to completely absorb the local father's attention, friends and family reported Monday that Jacob Rossbach, 35, has been on a serious parenting jag lately. "In the past few days, he's just been going nuts with the paternal encouragement and affection stuff--he's really gotten into it lately," said daughter Jenny, 7, adding that while she's not sure what put the parenting bug in her dad's ear, her father now spends nearly all his free time on activities such as doling out advice, providing material assistance, and imparting wisdom to his two children. "A few minutes ago he stopped by my room just to tell me he was proud of me. He's done that five times today. It's like, huh, guess he's going through a little nurturing-his-children phase or something." The sudden burst of commitment to his paternal duties reportedly replaces a fiscal responsibility kick that dominated the previous week and a half of Rossbach's life.
