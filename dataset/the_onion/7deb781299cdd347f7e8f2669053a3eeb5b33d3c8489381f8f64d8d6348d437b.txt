MILWAUKEE--The MLB Rules Committee announced the addition of a controversial new "no bunting" provision in the MLB rulebook Tuesday, described by chairman Sandy Alderson as "only fair." "A batter is out for illegal action when he fails to complete a full swing like everyone else just because he's fast and/or tricky," said Alderson, explaining the official instatement of Article 6.06(e) to the rules. "It's such a far run for the infielders, and plus it's so cheap." Other new rules include a 12-second time limit for a pitcher to deliver the ball, an automatic strike call for any batter who refuses to take his position in the batter's box, and the legalization of pegging.
