LOS ANGELES--L.A. Galaxy club officials said Monday that, under the terms of the insurance policy intended to protect their $250 million investment in star midfielder David Beckham, they would under no circumstances permit the high-priced Beckham to play soccer for them ever again. "We would have to be crazy to expose David to a hazard-filled game, situation, stadium, or even let him set foot in our potentially harmful training facilities," Galaxy head coach Frank Yallop said. "We have a quarter of a billion dollars invested in him, and our policy will not allow him to play in a game where physical contact, while rare, has been known to occur, as even a minor nagging injury could prevent Beckham from performing his primary duty of representing us in public." Galaxy executives addressed concerns that his wife Victoria will break him by announcing plans to encase Beckham in a protective block of Lucite, only taking him out for special promotional occasions.
