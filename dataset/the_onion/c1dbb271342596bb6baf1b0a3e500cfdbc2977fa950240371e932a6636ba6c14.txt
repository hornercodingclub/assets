An application for the Dry Creek School District in California has come under fire for asking if the child to be enrolled was delivered vaginally or via cesarean section. What do think? "That's good. I'm getting tired of having to provide that information in the 'Other Comments' section." Kelly Cartwright * Machine Wedger "I'm sorry, but I think they have a right to know if a prospective student is one of those weird vagy kids." Dean Yarber * Systems Analyst "Sounds like a pretty good way to find out what their moms are currently workin' with." Paul Thomas * Call-Out Operator
