BRISTOL, CT--Saying that the pair could barely take their eyes off one another throughout the hour-long sports news program, ESPN viewers told reporters Friday that it is increasingly clear anchors John Anderson and Matt Barrie are currently dating. "Based on the way they keep smiling at each other, it's pretty obvious something's going on there," said Athens, GA resident Paul Nevins, 37, adding that the hosts were openly flirting with each other throughout the "Top 10 Plays" countdown, with Barrie at one point mentioning how cute Anderson looked in his suit today. "They must have taken a trip to Florida together, because they couldn't stop bringing up some weekend getaway during a segment on the Marlins. Then when Anderson threw to Barrie before the next story, I swear I heard him say, 'Thanks, honey.' I'm pretty sure they're playing footsie underneath that desk, too." At press time, Anderson and Barrie could be seen holding hands as the broadcast returned from commercial.
