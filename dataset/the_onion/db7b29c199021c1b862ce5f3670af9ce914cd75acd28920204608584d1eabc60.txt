A judge has ruled that the rights to the 'Happy Birthday' song, despite being held by the same party since 1988 and generating a profit of $2 million each year from the song's use in movies and TV, are actually within the public domain and that the lyrics themselves were never copyrighted, which could lead to the return of royalties paid to use the song. What do think? "If we don't protect these copyrights there won't be any incentive for people to create new birthday songs."
