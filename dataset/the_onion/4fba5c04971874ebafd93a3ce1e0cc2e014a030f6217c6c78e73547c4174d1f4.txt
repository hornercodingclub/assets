PROVIDENCE, RI--Realizing the depths of her mistake far too late, local woman Alicia Cohen quietly admitted to herself, "Twas hubris led me here," as she sat naked on a public toilet with her romper around her ankles, sources said Wednesday. "What hath my conceit wrought but ruin as I sit naked and discomfited upon this most unclean privy," said Cohen, shivering upon the women's restroom toilet with her one-piece garment pooled at her feet. "Vanity's fool am I! Brought low as dust by folly, low as the once fine fabric that now lies crumpled before mine eyes." At press time, Cohen was cursing a broken shoe heel and the "credulous newborn babe undone by faith foul misplaced in an outlet mall."
