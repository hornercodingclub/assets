CRANSTON, RI--Capping off a month of unruly behavior that included defacement of school property, possession of forbidden items, and persistent backtalk and rebelliousness, sources say actor Shia LaBeouf attempted to escape from a dormitory window of the Homewood Training School for Wayward Boys last night, marking his third such attempt during the summer quarter. "I'm making my way out of this hole--good luck, kid," the 27-year-old star reportedly said to his bunkmate before packing his cot with pillows and lowering himself from the building's third-story window, aided by an improvised ladder of knotted bed sheets. "Look me up when you're out. And make a break for it soon, if you got half a brain." After being promptly apprehended when a night guard caught LaBeouf scaling the facility's front gate, Homewood officials reportedly debated what to do with the smirking young man, whose only was response was, "Call my dad, see if he cares."
