Wasatch High School in Utah is facing criticism after several female students discovered the yearbook staff had altered their photos by digitally adding sleeves and higher necklines, changes officials said were made to comply with the school's dress code. What do think? "That's horrible. You should only digitally alter photos of women to make them look thinner." J.D. Wolfe * Signal Clearance Supervisor "Oh, I don't know. I still think they're plenty sexy." David Krause * Roofing Instructor "And yet my daughter's yearbook let her look like a little harlot. Shows how much they care." Grace Corrollo * Community Organizer
