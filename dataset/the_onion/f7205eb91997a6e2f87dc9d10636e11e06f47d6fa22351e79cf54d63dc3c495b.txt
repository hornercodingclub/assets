THE HEAVENS--Saying that being featured on the long-running game show was a dream come true, God, our Lord and Heavenly Father, confirmed Wednesday that He was incredibly humbled to be the answer to a Jeopardy question. "Obviously, when I separated the light from the darkness and created all things I wasn't doing it for the recognition, but it still feels really cool to see my name up on the board like that," said the Almighty, who spent the day taking calls from friends congratulating Him on being the answer to a $600 clue in the category of "Religion." "I can't believe Alex Trebek said my name on TV! I'm such a huge Jeopardy fan, so it's pretty awesome that I get to be a little part of it. Sure, it would have been nice to be the Daily Double, but I'm not complaining." At press time, God had emailed His son a link to the episode with a note to jump to the 12-minute mark to see the clue.
