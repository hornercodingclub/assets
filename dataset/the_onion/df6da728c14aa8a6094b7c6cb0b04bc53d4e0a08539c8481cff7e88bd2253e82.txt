WASHINGTON--Calling the pictorial "disgusting" and "very unsettling," millions of Americans were reportedly deeply disturbed by the semi-nude photos of 78-year-old Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig in 's annual Body Issue last week, sources confirmed Friday. "Getting a glimpse at the incredible physiques of athletes like Colin Kaepernick, Kerri Walsh Jennings, and Sydney Leroux was really cool, but turning the page to see Bud Selig standing there buck naked and shielding his genitals with his left hand was, I have to say, a bit much," San Diego resident Jason Dawson, 31, said of the three-page spread, which contained strategically shot pictures of a naked Selig from multiple angles covering himself only with an MLB baseball cap and a catcher's mitt. "To be honest, it pretty much ruined the entire issue for me." While undoubtedly put off by the images of Selig, many Americans admitted to reporters that the feature was far easier to stomach than last year's controversial double-page spread of completely nude Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland lying in the spread-eagle position at home plate.
