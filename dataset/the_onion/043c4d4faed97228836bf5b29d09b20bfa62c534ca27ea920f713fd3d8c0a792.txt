A quadrupedal machine known as the Cheetah set a land-speed record for legged robots, running 18 mph on a treadmill in a U.S. military-funded lab. What do think? "This is the first step on the road to a glorious future where everyone has a robot to do their exercising for them." Kyle Gonsales * Welder Helper "Sure, it performs great in a lab, but can it defuse bombs like a real cheetah?" Jerry Rose * Kitchen Clerk "If we can make a robot cheetah that runs 18 miles per hour, maybe we could even build a robot polar bear that freezes and breaks below 32 degrees."
