NEW ORLEANS--Sources within the NFL's competition committee tentativelty confirmed Monday that, according to their preliminary analysis of statistics compiled during Sunday's St. Louis-New Orleans game, the previously winless Rams did indeed score more points than the Saints and therefore must officially be declared the winner. "Further review is in order, up to and including watching a full recording of the game, if in fact any broadcaster bothered to make one," commissioner Roger Goodell told disbelieving reporters Monday. "Still, the smattering of eyewitness accounts we have collected, including several from officials in attendance, seem to bear out reports of a Rams victory." The Saints organization has thus far refused comment on the issue, but say they will dutifully comply with any decision reached by the league "no matter how outrageous."
