ANAHEIM, CA--As a reward for following directions the best of all his classmates, local first-grader Daniel Reinhart received a sticker Friday recognizing his good behavior during a lockdown drill at Paul Revere Elementary School. "You did such a super job, Daniel," said teacher Anna Jarvis, handing the beaming 6-year-old a sparkly gold star for making less noise than anyone when the lights were shut off, the door was locked, and the entire class was ushered into the closet. "He was the quietest little mouse, but most of you did a great job too!" At press time, Jarvis was telling another student that if he wanted a sticker next time, it was very, very, very important he not giggle.
