WASHINGTON--Expressing their desire to provide American students with a well-rounded education, officials from the Department of Education announced Tuesday they had hired 26-year-old art teacher Kelsey Alexander to be spread evenly across all U.S. public schools. "Ms. Alexander is a well-qualified teacher, and we have the utmost confidence that she will provide quality art instruction to our nation's students as she rotates through each of the 98,000 public schools in this country," said Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who explained that Alexander will teach a 40-minute studio art course to each of the grade levels at a different school each day, beginning with Colby High School in Denver on Wednesday, until she eventually visits every school in the nation, at which point she will cycle back to the beginning and start again. "An education in the visual arts is a vital part of every child's education, and with Ms. Alexander's hiring, we can now guarantee that each student in America will have an art class at some point during their K-through-12 years. We know she will make a wonderful addition to every single school district in the country." As of press time, Alexander had spent an estimated $3.2 million out of pocket on the art supplies needed for her lessons.
