MIAMI--Following the Miami Heat's decisive Game 7 victory over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference championship series Monday night, security personnel at American Airlines Arena reportedly rushed to the floor to prevent Erik Spoelstra from joining the Heat in celebrating their win. "Sir, sir! You can't go onto the court; celebration's for members of the Heat organization only. No fans allowed," head of security Michael Welsh was reportedly overheard telling Spoelstra before he was forced to physically restrain him. "Sir, I do not know who you are, but this is the Heat's big moment. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave or I'm gonna make you leave. Either one." Sources later confirmed that as Spoelstra was being escorted from the arena by security, he yelled, "LeBron! LeBron, over here!" at which point LeBron James looked over, saw his coach, and resumed celebrating with his teammates.
