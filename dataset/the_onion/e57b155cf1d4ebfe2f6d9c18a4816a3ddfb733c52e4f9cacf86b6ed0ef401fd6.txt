Sony Pictures has issued an apology for insensitively depicting a gardener's blackberry allergies in children's film Peter Rabbit after drawing criticism for a comedic scene in which rabbits pelt the villainous character with blackberries. What do think? "Well, my family won't be seeing Peter Rabbit no matter what the closing-credits rap number is." Kerry Millstein * Juvenalia Scribe "After reading what he did to McGregor's garden, I put nothing past that son of a bitch." Nicholas Hanson * Gin Taster "While Sony's issuing them, we never really got an apology for Angels And Demons." Matthew Pasternak * Stile Builder
