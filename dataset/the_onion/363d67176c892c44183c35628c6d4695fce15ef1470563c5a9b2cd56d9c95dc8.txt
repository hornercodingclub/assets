BROOKLYN, NY--Assuring him that the food wasn't any different than what he was used to, 26-year-old Brendan Aaker reportedly explained that "flatbread means pizza" to his visiting father while dining at a neighborhood restaurant on Thursday. "The crust is a little thinner than regular pizza, but it's the same thing," said Aaker, who, noticing his father's bewilderment, added that "margherita" was pretty much cheese pizza with a few basil leaves on it, which he could take off if he wanted. "Just get the 'jamon'--it's ham. You'll like it." At press time, Aaker was alerting his father to what the doors labeled "WC" meant before he went looking for the men's room.
