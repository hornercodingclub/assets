NEW YORK--Admitting that it has always been a lifelong dream of his, baseball commissioner Bud Selig told reporters Wednesday that he still hopes to eventually attend a game at every MLB stadium in the country. "So far, I've been to six--Fenway, Tropicana, Nationals Park, the Phillies one, and both stadiums in New York," said Selig, who then quickly corrected himself upon realizing he has yet to visit the new Yankee Stadium. "I haven't done Milwaukee yet, or any of the Midwest ballparks, now that I think about it. I haven't been to any on the West Coast either, but next week I'll be in L.A. for work, so I might try to finally see the Dodgers if they have a home game then." Selig then added that he will hopefully cross several stadiums off his list this August during a long road trip he has been planning with his father.
