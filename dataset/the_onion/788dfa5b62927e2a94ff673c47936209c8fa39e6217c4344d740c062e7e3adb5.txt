SAN FRANCISCO--In an interview concerning his upcoming start against the Nationals, San Francisco Giants ace Barry Zito announced that he would no longer be throwing curveballs in either practices or game situations due to pressure from his father, Joe. "Dad says it could really mess up my arm for good if I throw too many curveballs," said the visibly embarrassed Zito, whose trademark curve has been a key to the success that saw him sign a seven-year, $126 million contract this past offseason. "Dad also says I shouldn't be pitching so much and that I should have a pitch count of, like, 75 pitches. Plus Coach [Giants manager Bruce] Bochy is always using me for both ends of a double-header and then in relief the next day, and that makes my arm hurt." When asked for comment, a disgruntled Bochy wondered if Zito's arm would be less sore if he wasn't also playing shortstop for his traveling high school team.
