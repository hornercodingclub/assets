SYRACUSE, NY--Days after stepping foot onto the minor league baseball diamond for the first time, recently called up Syracuse Chiefs catcher Kris Watts told reporters Wednesday that he never in his wildest dreams thought he would one day have the chance to play in the "legendary" NBT Bank Stadium. "As a kid, you always fantasize about someday playing at the 'T, but to see it actually happen--it's just incredible," said the wide-eyed AAA backstop, adding that he still can't believe he gets to run the bases on the same "hallowed ground" where Syracuse legend Corey Brown once hit a grand slam off Ryan Feierabend in front of 11,000 screaming Chiefs fans. "I mean, I leave my house every day and drive right up to 1 Tex Simone Drive like it's the most normal thing on earth. And then I walk out of the dugout to play catch with guys like Yunesky Maya and Mark Lowe. It's just crazy to think about." Watts added that he still hadn't quite wrapped his head around the fact that he now plays under iconic Chiefs manager and former Pittsburgh Pirates third-base coach Tony Beasley.
