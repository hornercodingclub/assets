ARLINGTON, TX--Marking the Cowboys' season opener against the Giants in traditional fashion, Dallas fans were reportedly treated to a thrilling halftime show Sunday night that featured the execution of a Texas state prisoner. "That was the best halftime show I've seen in years--there was this awesome light show with Toby Keith's 'American Ride' playing over the sound system while a priest administered the last rites," said 46-year-old Cowboys fan Alan Kierstead, adding that he especially enjoyed when Cowboys cheerleaders formed the shape of a skull around the stage and performed an elaborate dance routine before the convicted felon was injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital. "My favorite part was when he finally went limp and all those fireworks shot up from the top of the stadium. I just wish I were one of those lucky people on the field who got to watch it close-up." Delighted fans also told reporters that the halftime execution was far better than any other such event at Texas Stadium, noting that the view of the inmate's last breath was much better on the venue's state-of-the-art 72-foot-tall LED jumbotron.
