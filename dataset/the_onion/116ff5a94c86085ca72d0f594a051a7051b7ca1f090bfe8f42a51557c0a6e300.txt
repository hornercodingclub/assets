SEATTLE--Admitting that the sight of him laying out his vision for the company was pretty endearing, employees at Rainier Solutions reported Monday that it was kind of sweet that CEO Greg Warner thinks he is doing a good job. "He sits there at his little desk sending out all-staff emails outlining our goals for the rest of the year, and you can tell he actually believes he's contributing something worthwhile--it's sort of cute," said employee Corinne Dwyer, adding that the entire staff found it "absolutely adorable" how proud Warner was when he introduced his ideas for an ambitious social media marketing campaign earlier this month. "Yesterday, he came up with this slogan to motivate the staff, and it was obvious he really thought people were inspired by it. Sometimes I just wanna hug that lovable little empty suit." Dwyer went on to say that it broke her heart just imagining the look on Warner's darling face when he finds out she and most everyone else in her department are quitting.
