TAMPA, FL--On the eve of the Republican National Convention, GOP officials have announced that the three-day event will feature a solid, all-star lineup of the party's most prominent female listeners. "A veritable who's who of conservative women are scheduled to stand on the convention floor and listen attentively to what each male speaker has to say about the major issues facing our country," RNC communications director Sean Spicer said Monday, confirming that an impressive variety of blond, smiling women with perfectly maintained hair and jewelry will be on prominent display and seated near television cameras. "I would say this is one of the most impressive rosters of dead-silent female Republicans wearing nice dresses that we've ever had at the convention." Spicer also reassured convention-goers that the solid roster of women listeners had all been informed not to get in the way too much and, if possible, to show slightly more cleavage.
