CHICAGO--Stressing that the movie "definitely had some cool moments," local man Jeff Feitel, who saw six times over the holidays, told reporters Monday that he thought it was pretty good. "I had a few issues with some stuff, but overall I thought it was a fun movie," said Feitel, who over the past two weeks has cumulatively spent 14 hours and $87 attending screenings of the film, including multiple 3D viewings, a midnight showing, and an IMAX screening at 8:50 a.m. "I honestly thought the lightsaber battles were just so-so, but the reliance on practical effects was kind of awesome. And it lays out a pretty compelling mythology for the next couple movies, too."At press time, Feitel was reportedly purchasing a ticket to see again that evening.
