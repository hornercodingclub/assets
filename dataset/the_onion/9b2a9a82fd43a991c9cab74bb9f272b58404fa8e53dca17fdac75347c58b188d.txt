Sony Pictures is planning a direct sequel to the 1984 science-fiction comedy , ignoring the 2016 all-female reboot. What do think? "I blindly trashed the reboot with out seeing it, so it's only fair I blindly praise this sequel." Chandni Noel * Battery Recycler "I think it's great that men are finally getting the chance to portray ghostbusters." Nelly Povey * Tag Clipper "Finally! I've been dying to see a deeper exploration of the tragically flawed but compelling character of Slimer." Eshaan Lacey * Paint Peeler
