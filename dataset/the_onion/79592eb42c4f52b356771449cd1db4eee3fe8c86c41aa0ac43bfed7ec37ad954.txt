SIERRA VISTA, AZ--Looking around in a panic as he realized he had been left all alone, ICE agent Derek Borland was reportedly terrified Tuesday after becoming separated from his team during a raid on an immigrant community. "Where did everyone go? Guys, I'm really scared right now. Anyone? Bobby? Bobby, where are you?" said the frightened Borland, 41, who reportedly dashed through an apartment complex in a frantic effort to find his teammates and broke down in tears when he was unable to locate anyone he recognized. "Where did everyone go? Don't leave me alone here, I'm so scared. These guys are like my family--what if I never see them again? Anyone? Please, someone, help me!" At press time, the ICE agent was feeling much better after being reunited with his team and shoving an undocumented immigrant family into the back of a van.
