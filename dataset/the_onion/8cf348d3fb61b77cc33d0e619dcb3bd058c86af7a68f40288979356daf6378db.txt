LOS ANGELES--Citing a dire need for additional reshoots, visibly panicked officials at Warner Bros. studios announced Wednesday that they had decided to delay the release of the upcoming Superman film in order to get more footage of people looking up in wonder and awe. "At this time, we have alarmingly few shots of awestruck passersby looking up at the sky, squinting just a touch, and making an 'I can't believe what I'm seeing right now' face, which means we have no choice but to delay Friday's release indefinitely," Warner Bros. president of distribution Dan Fellman told reporters, noting that filmmakers are currently rushing to finish a critical sequence in which a man in a business suit lifts his head skyward, exhibits a mesmerized expression on his face, and holds his hand to his forehead as Superman whizzes by. "We have a fair amount of scenes of fathers holding young children in their arms and pointing straight up, but even then, we're going to need at least another six weeks of shooting in order to get more shots of cab drivers swiftly turning their heads and saying 'Did you see that?' or 'Holy....!'" At press time, officials were reportedly relieved upon learning that filmmakers had completed the film's final shot in which Superman flies straight into the camera, the screen turns black, and the credits roll.
