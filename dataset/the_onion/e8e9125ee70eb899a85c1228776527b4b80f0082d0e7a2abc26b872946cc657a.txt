"I remember we were talking about Ed Harris and how he's in , but how did Connecticut come up?" 39-year-old Taylor Clark asked a group of focused friends, whose intensive review of the exchange revealed they had listed their favorite sci-fi movies, which led to a discussion of the space program and, from there, dream jobs, NASCAR, and which members of the group enjoyed driving.
