WASHINGTON--Citing today's announcement that transgender individuals would be banned from serving in any capacity in the United States armed forces, numerous sources within the Trump administration expressed a deep sense of concern Wednesday that the president was burning through minority scapegoats at an unsustainable rate. "I was hoping we'd be able to keep the transgender community in our back pockets for at least another year, but we're barely six months into the first term and the president goes and wastes that card on military overspending and unpreparedness--we just can't keep up this kind of pace," Chief of Staff Reince Priebus reportedly told top advisors in a closed-door meeting this morning, sharing his concern that President Trump had already used the nation's Hispanics and Muslims as targets of blame for all of the country's criminal problems and terrorist threats, respectively. "We've got to make it through three and a half more years, and there are only so many minorities we can pin the country's issues on. At this rate, we'll be holding gay parents responsible for our cultural decline by October and targeting Jews for economic stagnation by the end of this year. Who the hell are we going to hit after that when we get into another crisis? Christ, this is bad." Priebus reportedly took some solace, however, upon being reminded that the nation's black community was always available as a suitable fallback scapegoat for any conceivable social or political ill whenever the Trump administration needed one.
