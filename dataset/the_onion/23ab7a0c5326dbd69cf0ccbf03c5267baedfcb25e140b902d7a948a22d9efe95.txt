NATAL, BRAZIL--Gathering his players in the locker room ahead of their opening World Cup match against Ghana, U.S. national team manager Jurgen Klinsmann reportedly concluded an emotional and inspirational pregame speech Monday by openly admitting his team would probably lose. "It's time for us to get out there and show the entire world what we're made of, but, you know, Ghana will probably win," Klinsmann reportedly told his players shortly after passionately stressing that they will be playing for every single one of their friends and family members back home. "Some of you have waited your entire lives for this moment, which is a shame, because Ghana is more than likely going to beat us by two or three goals. Because they're a better team. So, I don't know--just do your best, I guess." At press time, reports confirmed that Klinsmann could be heard shouting to his players from the sidelines that even if they miraculously scraped by with a tie, they would almost certainly lose to both Portugal and Germany and be knocked out of the tournament in the group stage.
