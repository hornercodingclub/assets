With baseball's postseason underway, Onion Sports takes its annual look at the playoff teams and their chances to take home the 2007 World Series title: : Have it in the bag, unless someone jinxes them by saying something like "the Cubs have it in the bag" : Have a pretty decent shot at winning the World Series if they win three games, followed by four games, and then win four more games after that : With quality pitching, hitting, and defense, the Angels have all the tools necessary to go all the way; however, they won't : Curt Schilling  remains the team's only question mark, aside from the overall health of Manny Ramirez and whether or not David Ortiz's problematic knee will hold up throughout the playoffs; also, Daisuke Matsuzaka performing under the incredible pressure of October baseball is also a concern : Seeing  as how an Indians-Diamondbacks World Series would be the most awful, boring thing in the world, Murphy's Law says the Indians are pretty much a shoo-in to go all the way : Should just be happy to even be on this list : Nope : Although it has not worked for the past six years, the Yankees' strategy to win the World Series will continue to consist of just showing up : Oh, man...Damn it! Come on, what do they--Jesus! Are you kidding me? Seriously, is this some kind of joke?
