PITTSBURGH--Noting that the dozens of rambling, overly excited posts date all the way back to when the clip was first uploaded in early 2011, sources confirmed Thursday that every comment below a YouTube video of the famed 1972 "Immaculate Reception" football play was clearly written by Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris. "Hands down THE best play in NFL history," read a post left at 3:45 a.m. by YouTube user FHarris32, whose avatar appears to be a recent photo of Harris wearing his four Super Bowl rings on both hands. "This is what started the Steel Curtain dynasty and helped create one of the greatest teams of all-time. I still can't believe I caught the ball like that after it was knocked down. Go Steelers!!!!" At press time, a long, largely incoherent rant disputing the "bullshit catch" had been posted by a YouTube account suspected to belong to former Oakland Raiders safety Jack Tatum.
