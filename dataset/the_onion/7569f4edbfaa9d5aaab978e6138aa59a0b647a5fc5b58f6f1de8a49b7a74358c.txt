As a publicity stunt, Abercrombie & Fitch has offered to pay Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino to wear its clothing line, saying they believe an association with him is "contrary to the aspirational image of the brand." What do think? "I've been not-wearing their clothes for decades and I haven't made a dime. And I'm a complete jerk-off. The world just doesn't make sense anymore." Sara Kingdom * Systems Analyst "Poor Abercrombie & Fitch. They're merely trying to sexualize young girls and subtly mock Asian people and The Situation has to come in and tarnish their good name." Don Chaplett * Dado Operator "They tried that with Tara Reid and Kmart's Kathy Ireland line. Didn't work." Damon Wills * Flanger
