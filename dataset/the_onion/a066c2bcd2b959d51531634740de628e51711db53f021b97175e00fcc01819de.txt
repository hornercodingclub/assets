BRAYTON, IA--Local residents Harold and Eileen Weintraub were surprised and confused Sunday night when, while watching the 2008 Olympic Games on NBC, they saw their next-door neighbor Philip Truesdell, 57, judging women's gymnastics events. "Hey Eileen, is that...is that Phil?" Harold Weintraub said to his wife, who after walking over to the television, confirmed that the man in the suit scoring international competitors in the vault, floor, and balance beam events was in fact their neighbor of 22 years. "What's he doing there? I talked to him while he was mowing his lawn just last week, and he didn't mention anything about going to Beijing. I didn't even know he liked gymnastics. And why does that nameplate in front of him say 'Australia'? Honey, is Phil Australian?" The Weintraubs later realized the incident explains why Truesdell, who they had already known to be a figure skating judge, took vacations every two instead of every four years.
