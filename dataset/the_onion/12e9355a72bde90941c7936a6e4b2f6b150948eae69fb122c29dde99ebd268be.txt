Last week, Hillary Clinton said she would give "careful thought" to running for a U.S. Senate seat in New York. What do think about the prospect of a Senator Clinton? "I don't know... If she wasn't woman enough for Bill, how can she satisfy an entire district?" Sanjay Seter * Security Guard "As a strong '90s woman, I feel Hillary should definitely run for the Senate. She could totally get back at Bill that way." Sasha Higgins * Caterer "Hillary can do anything she sets her mind to. Oh, wait. No, she can't--that's Oprah." Felicia Griffin * Florist "It'd be great. That way, she wouldn't have to stop lying for at least six more years." Andrew Robinson * Systems Analyst "I'm just not sure Hillary has the drive and ambition necessary for a career in politics." Donald Vaught * Investment Banker "I would have no moral problems voting for her. After all, I'm pretty sure she never gave oral sex to the president." Paul Rice * Driving Instructor
