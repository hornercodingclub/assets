What do think? "Hopefully Ron Howard gets his chance to sing lead on a couple of the digitally remastered tracks." Kirsten Roiland * Amateur Beekeeper "Fantastic! I've been looking for a recording of 'All My Loving' drowned out by the collective shrieks of 17,000 teenage girls." Cole McBride * Playbill Folder "Too late. I'm into Herman's Hermits now."
