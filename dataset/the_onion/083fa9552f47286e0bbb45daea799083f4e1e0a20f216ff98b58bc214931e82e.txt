MEDINAH, IL-- During Sunday's post-tournament trophy ceremony at Medinah Golf Club, Tiger Woods took the opportunity to credit his 2006 PGA Championship victory to his Nike SasQuatch 460 cc Driver, Nike One Platinum Golf Ball, and his Nike Forged Blade Irons. "I didn't feel like I was swinging the club the way I wanted, but thankfully the club I was swinging was made of soft, 1030 carbon steel that gives me exceptional feel and spin control," Woods said. "I also wouldn't have made all those birdie putts if it weren't for my Scotty Cameron Studio Newport 2 Putter with standard lie and loft." Tiger will now turn his focus toward the Ryder Cup at Ireland's Kildare Golf Club, where he believes his Nike Dri-Fit Tour Glove and his waterproof Nike SP 7 Tiger Woods Tour Shoes will easily overcome any adverse weather conditions.
