MILWAUKEE--While speaking to reporters prior to Saturday's game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun admitted he consistently follows an elaborate, superstitious routine in which he always makes sure to step into the batter's box before swinging at pitches. "I know it's crazy, but I've just got to have my feet planted firmly in that box before I'll even so much as look at a pitch," said Braun, noting that his complex at-bat ritual also includes gripping his bat with both hands and making sure to face the pitcher at all times. "A lot of the guys make fun of me because I'm always tapping my bat on the plate to make sure I'm positioned correctly and putting most of my weight on my back leg before taking a hack, but, really, baseball players all have weird little quirks like that. Hey, whatever works, you know?" The superstitious ballplayer added that he also follows the game's more traditionally observed practices, such as making sure to step directly on the foul lines when coming on or off the field and enthusiastically discussing a no-hitter in progress to make sure the pitcher is aware of it.
