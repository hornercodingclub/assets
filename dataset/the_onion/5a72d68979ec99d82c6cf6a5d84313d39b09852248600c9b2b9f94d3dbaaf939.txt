A self-described "friend" of Vice President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley is attempting to sell for $250,000 a video in which the 27-year-old purportedly does cocaine. What do think? "I don't get it. What's the hook here? Does she do cocaine really well? Is it an impressive amount of cocaine?" George Furlong * Humane Officer "If she was snorting it through one of those pocket Constitutions that Kucinich hands out, I'll go get my checkbook." Peggy Bryan * Watch Assembly Inspector "Did you know there's a videotape of Richard Hilton's daughter Paris having sex?" Leon Walker * Cabinetmaker
