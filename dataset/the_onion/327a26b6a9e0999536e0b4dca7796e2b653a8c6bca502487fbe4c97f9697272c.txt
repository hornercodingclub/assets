SAUGUS, MA--Arguing that he had been allowed to wear it in the past, local youth Andrew Robillard protested a parental edict barring his Iron Man costume from the upcoming funeral of his late grandfather. "I wanna wear my Iron Man costume," said an outraged Robillard, 6, of the $20 superhero outfit purchased from Target last October. "Iron Man is awesome and I wanna wear it." A further 10 minutes of pro-Iron Man rhetoric touched upon several of his greatest adventures and the coolest elements of his design. At press time, Andrew was willing to compromise on a jacket and tie if permitted to bring his Arctic Shock Super Soaker.
