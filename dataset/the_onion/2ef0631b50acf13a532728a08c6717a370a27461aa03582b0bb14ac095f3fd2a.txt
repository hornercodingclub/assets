MILWAUKEE--Saying that he has been wondering about its taste for quite some time, Brewers first baseman Prince Fielder was witnessed putting small clumps of infield dirt into his mouth during the fourth inning of Monday night's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. "There was a little bit of time between warm-ups and the first batter, so I figured I'd finally give it a try," Fielder told reporters after the game, adding that because of dirt's brown coloring, he was curious if it would taste like chocolate. "It wasn't bad. Not great. But not bad." In the past, Fielder has been seen nibbling on his baseball glove, bat, and the Wrigley Field ivy.
