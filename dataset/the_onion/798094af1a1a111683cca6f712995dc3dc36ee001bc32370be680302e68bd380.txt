NEW YORK--Following a demoralizing 14-28 loss to the Redskins Sunday in which he threw an interception and no touchdowns, Giants quarterback Eli Manning attempted to cheer himself up with the purchase of an oversized green leprechaun-style top hat. "I like it. It makes me feel better," Manning told reporters while wearing the large, dopey hat that reportedly cost $24.99 at a local Spencer Gifts. "I knew when I was sacked for a fourth time that it was going to be a hat day. This one made me laugh the most when I saw it, but the hat that looked like a traffic cone was funny too. I'm pretty sure I already have that one, though." According to sources close to the family, Manning's father yelled at him for wasting his money on yet another silly hat.
