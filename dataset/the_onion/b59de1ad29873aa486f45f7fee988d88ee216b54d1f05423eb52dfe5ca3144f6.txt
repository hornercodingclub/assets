OSN shares its expert analysis on the teams that will come away with victory in this weekend's NFL week nine games: - Expect a tough and gritty matchup to eventually head to overtime deadlocked at 20-20, but with 6:38 left in the game, the voices in Andy Dalton's mind--those dark, terrible voices he thought he'd finally rid himself of--start speaking again, louder and louder until he loses concentration and gives up a game-ending safety. - This is another favorable matchup for the Chiefs, as the Bills have consistently struggled with winning games that they are playing in. - Expect this game to have a playoff-like atmosphere, given the dejected Falcons will be eliminated from the postseason. - Dallas tightens their grip on the NFC East race whether they win or lose. - This battle between Rex and Rob Ryan should settle once and for all which brother is the more competent loudmouthed pile of shit. - Look for Chargers receivers to show Brandon Meriweather the proper way to hit someone. - With the Rams' dangerous pass rushers Chris Long and Robert Quinn, Titans quarterback Jake Locker must rely on his mobility if he wants to get off the turf after sacks. - The Eagles mustn't get caught off guard by the devious read option from the Raiders, who will have their hands full trying to decipher Chip Kelly's secret weapon: the read option. - This game will most likely take Greg Schiano off the hot seat. - Fans of top-notch pro football should keep their eyes glued to the screen so they don't miss the two or three brief moments when it occurs during this game. - The Steelers have never been this much fun to watch. - Don't let the Texans' 2-5 record fool you--their two wins were close scrapes against the Chargers and the Titans. - Green Bay's rookie running back Eddie Lacy will be challenged mentally and physically by the massive, daunting holes in the Bears' defense.
