CANTON, OH--E*Trade, Coca-Cola, and Pizza Hut, all first-year eligible candidates, have been announced as finalists for the 2006 Advertisers' Class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. "We feel this is the loudest, most omnipresent series of ads since Budweiser's 'Wassup' and the Coors Light 'Twins' were inducted two years ago," said Hall of Fame Interim Executive Director Ron Dougherty. "We're looking forward to seeing which of these highly qualified candidates will have their advertising campaigns cast in bronze and placed with the other immortals in the General Motors Memorial Advertisers' Wing." Representatives from the 20 largest advertising agencies will make their selections in the next month, with inductees scheduled to be announced during, and as part of, the fourth through eighth commercial breaks of the ESPY Awards on July 12.
