FOXBOROUGH, MA--Trailing in the final seconds of last Sunday's game against New England, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning, 30, stunned the Patriots by throwing a big-boy touchdown to clinch a victory. "I did it! I did it!" a jubilant Manning said after the win, adding several times that he threw the big-boy touchdown all by himself "without help from anybody in the whole wide world." "Did you see me? Did you see me throw the ball to my friend in the touchdown?" A day later, Eli's older brother Peyton confirmed that he did in fact see the play, and yes, Eli is a big boy who will grow up and be big and strong like his brother.
