BENTON HARBOR, MI--According to statements made this week by office manager Caitlin Mooney, 26, her friends are all so funny that they should be comedians. "Honestly, my friend Meg says stuff that's so hilarious it could totally be on TV," said Mooney, adding that the woman "has no filter," and everything that comes out of her mouth is absolutely hysterical. "And my roommate Reshmi just says the craziest, most random stuff. She seriously should have a podcast or something where it's just her telling all her stories." Sources confirmed that Mooney went on to reveal that her friend Alice is "exactly like Tina Fey."
