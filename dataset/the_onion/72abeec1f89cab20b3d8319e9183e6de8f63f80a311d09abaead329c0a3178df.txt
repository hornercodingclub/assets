SANFORD, FL--Claiming that his second-degree murder trial has "dragged on for way too long," sources confirmed Thursday that former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman offered to just plead guilty and pay the fine or whatever. "Look, I'm sick of having to deal with this, so just let me pay the 100 bucks or whatever it is and I'll be on my way," said Zimmerman, noting that he has already wasted three weeks in court fighting his murder charge in the February 2012 shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. "At this point, I don't even care anymore. I'll take the slap on the wrist if it means I can get back to my life. And if I have to do community service or something then, fine, I'll do that too." Zimmerman added that he really needed to wrap things up by tomorrow at the latest, since he has "already missed way too many days of work for this stupid thing."
