BUFFALO, NY--Speculating that he must think he's "real goddamn funny," observers at Overtime Sports Bar & Grill confirmed Monday that a man is walking around wearing a Kevin Kolb jersey like some kind of smart-ass. "Looks like we've got a grade-A wise guy on our hands," said Joe Phillabaum, 32, adding that the "fucking guy actually spent 120 dollars for this one joke." "A Kevin Kolb jersey. Yeah, we get it, pal. Good one. Why don't you go attend a game and get him to autograph a football while you're at it? Cocky fucker." At press time, Phillabaum had walked over to shake the asshole's hand and congratulate him on making everyone in the whole bar laugh.
