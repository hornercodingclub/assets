WASHINGTON--As part of an effort to provide equal opportunities across habitats and enrich the lives of wildlife throughout the nation, officials from the EPA unveiled a new biodiversity program Friday that will bus in species from different ecosystems. "We are firmly committed to creating a diverse biosphere by fostering relationships between flora and fauna with unique experiences and perspectives," agency spokesman Adam Wilson said of the federally funded program, which launched this week by shuttling two dozen species of plants and animals from the Everglades to the northern Great Plains. "Before these exchanges, many fir trees in the Colorado Rockies, for example, might go their entire lives without ever meeting a clam. But soon, they'll be able to live together in harmony and gain a new understanding of their different backgrounds and biomes." At press time, sources confirmed that a charter bus filled with javelinas and saguaro cacti had been stopped by protesters at the Arkansas border demanding they go back to the desert.
