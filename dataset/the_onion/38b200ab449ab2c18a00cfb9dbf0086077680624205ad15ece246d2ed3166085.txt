NEW YORK--Insisting that if the young street musician doesn't apply himself more, he'll never work his way up to a good busking spot in Times Square, local mother Rita Skolnick reportedly told her son Wednesday to "go upstairs right now" and get to practicing his buckets. "When you begged me to get you those buckets, you promised you'd practice an hour every day, and now they just sit there collecting dust," Skolnick shouted at her son Tyler, 15, pointing at a pair of white plastic buckets in the corner of his room. "You should be setting aside a solid block of time every afternoon to sit down and practice your buckets. That's the only way you're going to get better." Sources confirmed that half an hour later, Skolnick again yelled at her son when she went into his room and found him sitting on one of his buckets and playing video games.
