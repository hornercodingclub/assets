A growing number of engaged women are undergoing plastic surgery procedures on their hands to look better in pictures they take of the rings on their fingers, known as "ring selfies," paying $3,000 or more to smooth out skin texture and reduce the appearance of veins.

Jerry Bresnahan * Keyboard Cleaner "And all this time, I never realized I could've been judging women by their hands." Ted Schubb * Floor Plan Tester
