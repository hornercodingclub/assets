JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA--Solemn-faced sources confirmed today that you do not want to know anything at all about what is happening at this very moment to 36-year-old Saudi Arabian woman Assi Omran. According to reports, no matter what you think she might be going through, the reality is much worse, and you would unquestionably be better off just tuning this one out and focusing on something else entirely. Experts suggested that even a single glimpse of what she's enduring right now would become permanently ingrained in your mind and inflict severe emotional damage--especially if you knew what that man is about to do with the hot pan of boiling water he's just picked up from the stove, --so, clearly, the less said the better, agreed? Others stated that if you stop to consider that Omran lives in a nation in which she cannot even legally leave her house without the permission of the man presently doing unspeakable things to her, you will likely not make it through the rest of your day without suffering a complete psychological breakdown. In addition, sources said you'll feel better if you don't dwell on the fact that 14 million women live in Saudi Arabia and the same thing could happen to any one of them at any time.
