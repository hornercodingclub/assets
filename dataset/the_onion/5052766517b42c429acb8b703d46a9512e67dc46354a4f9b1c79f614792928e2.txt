In her speech last night at the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump spoke on the themes of hard work and striving to achieve one's dreams, passages that critics say were lifted nearly verbatim from Michelle Obama's 2008 speech at the DNC.

Darien Huff * Montage Splicer "I'd have a pretty hard time filling 20 minutes with praise for Donald Trump too." Thad Jenkins * Patio Sweeper "Sure, what Melania did was embarrassing for Trump's campaign, but wearing an insufficient amount of makeup would have been way worse." Leila Gaffney * Glue Bottler
