BRUNSWICK, ME--Fourth-grade sources reported this week that in order to acquire the shark tooth necklace he wears to school each day, area 10-year-old Brendan Landsley must have killed a great white shark. "Brendan probably was in the ocean, saw this huge shark, and then just jumped right on its back," said classmate Ryan Pierson, speculating that Landsley also likely held on to the animal's fin and was dragged underwater for miles. "Then I bet he took out a knife or a harpoon and stabbed it a bunch of times and ripped the tooth right out of its jaws. He's probably got a bite mark somewhere from when he was wrestling with it." Schoolyard sources also agreed that sharks probably come nowhere near Landsley anymore when they see the trophy from his kill dangling around his neck.
