NEW YORK--In an effort to reduce soreness and prevent injury, New York City Marathon winner Geoffrey Mutai immediately followed his victory Sunday with a 7,209-mile cool-down jog from Central Park to his hometown of Mumberes, Kenya. "Got to keep the blood flowing," Mutai told reporters, jogging into the East River until his body was fully submerged. "I can't stress how important cooling down is for slowing your pulse and easing the strain on blarghlarlarblublub." Mutai was last spotted emerging from the shores of Cape Verde and continuing his run without removing the seaweed covering his body or the squid attached to the top of his head.
