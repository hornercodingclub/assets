"God, I really want to just get home and sleep, but I still have a sit-down with the at 7:30, and my CNN segment is filming right after at nine," said McCafferty, lamenting that he didn't have a spare minute to finish email correspondences about rural neo-Nazis with NPR and PBS NewsHour because a Salon reporter accompanied him this week to better understand his hatred of black and Hispanic neighbors. "Don't get me wrong, I'm excited to spread the message of a white ethnostate, but I just can't do any more phone interviews with Chris Hayes or Jake Tapper while I'm driving my kids to school. It's draining." McCafferty added that he's at least been fortunate enough to still find time to harass local minorities and Jews.
