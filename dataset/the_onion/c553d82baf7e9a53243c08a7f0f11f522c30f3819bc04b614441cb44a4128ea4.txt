The four surviving original members of the Grateful Dead concluded their farewell tour in Chicago Sunday night, drawing over 70,000 fans to Soldier Field for each of their three final performances and shattering the venue's single-day attendance record previously held by U2. What do think? "Nice! I hope they closed with 'Casey Jones' and 'Box Of Rain' and 'Uncle John's Band' and 'Touch Of Grey' and 'Friend Of The Devil' and 'Ripple.'" Blake Roden * Plaque Engraver "I'm happy whenever anyone beats U2 at something." Leo Forchetti * Produce Inspector "Now that they're retired I hope they can finally relax."
