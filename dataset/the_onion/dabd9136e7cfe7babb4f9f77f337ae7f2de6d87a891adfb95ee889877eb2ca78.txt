TEMPE, AZ--Saying that he is "so overjoyed, excited, and thankful," 18-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps announced Sunday that his fiancee has given birth to a healthy 6-pound tadpole. "On behalf of myself and Nicole, I'm thrilled to say that on May 5 at 7:21 p.m., we welcomed a healthy, happy male tadpole, weighing in at 6 pounds and 11 ounces, with a 5-inch tail," read a statement from Phelps, which was accompanied by a photo of the smiling 30-year-old Olympian holding the newborn in his arms while gently caressing its gills. "Nicole and I are obviously incredibly tired after a lengthy 17-hour hatching, but we're doing fine and can't wait to get to know the newest member of our family." At press time, Phelps' publicist confirmed that the tadpole is now swimming comfortably with its parents back at the family's water tank.
