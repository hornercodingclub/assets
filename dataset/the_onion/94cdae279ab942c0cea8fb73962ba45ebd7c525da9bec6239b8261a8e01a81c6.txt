OKLAHOMA CITY--Despite his team's victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, Oklahoma City Thunder coach Scott Brooks admitted to reporters Wednesday night that forward Kevin Durant gave a largely subdued performance, converting just 94 of 128 shots and finishing the game with only 210 points. "Kevin had one of those nights where it just wasn't happening for him offensively, but we can't expect him to keep putting up 250 shots every game like he's been doing," said Brooks, stressing that Durant's underwhelming 49 rebounds, 57 assists, and 72 points from outside the arc are not indicative of any major issues with the three-time NBA scoring champion. "Credit has to go to the Timberwolves' defense--they contained Durant and restricted him to just 134 points inside the paint. But at the end of the day, it's only one game, and he'll bounce back from it. I wouldn't be surprised if he returns to his usual standard with at least 300 points next game." Brooks went on to say that the rest of his players "really stepped up" amidst Durant's struggles, collectively scoring 29 points.
