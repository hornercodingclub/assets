RALEIGH, NC--Boasting of his "special arrangement" at the popular casual-dining restaurant, Hampton Inn concierge Albert Roush explained Wednesday evening that he has a "long working relationship" with Janice, the second-shift hostess at the Chili's across the intersection. "Let's just say we look out for each other," Roush said of his mutually beneficial deal with the 35-year-old food-service staffer. "I've recommended Chili's to a lot of our guests over the years, and she's comped my Beef Bacon Ranch Quesadillas on more than one occasion. I scratch her back, she scratches mine, if you get me." Roush was later overheard telling a group of guests that if they want a table at the restaurant, they should just let him know and "[he'll] see what [he] can do."
