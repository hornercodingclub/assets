NEW YORK--Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain reportedly led a stuffed-animals-only meeting on the floor of the team's clubhouse Thursday, addressing confidants Wugsy the Bear, Cuddly Monkey, Fluff Fluff the Kitty, and Tiny Horsey. "Nobody else gets to come because they're too mean and won't let me be a starting pitcher, and they don't get a special treat," said Chamberlain, pretending to eat "strawberry pie sandwiches," which he also fed to each of the stuffed animals. "You guys all want me in the starting rotation, right? Yes, Tiny Horsey, I am the best thrower on the Yankees. Thank you for saying that. We don't need those other jerks. We can start our own Yankees right here." According to sources, the 45-minute stuffed-animals-only meeting adjourned when Yankees manager Joe Girardi announced that it was time for Chamberlain's bath.
