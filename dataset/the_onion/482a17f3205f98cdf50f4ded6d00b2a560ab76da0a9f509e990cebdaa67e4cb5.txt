WASHINGTON--In a breakthrough study that experts say completely reshapes our understanding of the cosmos, a team of astrophysicists at Oxford University have discovered that stars, the celestial bodies that represent the fundamental building blocks of galaxies, are composed primarily of twinkles. "When we look up at the night sky, all we see are tiny dots of light, but in reality these luminous interstellar objects are made up of trillions and trillions of tiny twinkles," said lead researcher Professor Paul Denton, who added that each twinkle itself contains billions of small twinkle fractals all held together by the forces of gravity. "Moreover, the twinkles we observe with the naked eye are in fact twinkles that twinkled millions of years ago that are only now visible from earth." Researchers added that twinkles are very pretty and sparkly.
