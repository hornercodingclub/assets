SCARSDALE, NY--Local couple Alison Fry and Peter Hartman told reporters Thursday they have both been pleased since opening up their relationship, saying the exciting new arrangement allowed them the freedom to psychologically wear down other people. "We decided that, at this point, we're both comfortable enough with each other that we can go outside of the relationship and explore making someone else completely miserable, all while knowing that the two of us are the ones we truly care about devastating emotionally," Fry explained of the agreement, which allows her and Hartman to guiltlessly seek out additional partners and burden them with their insecurities. "At first, I wasn't sure if overwhelming other people with our respective selfishness and emotional neediness was for us. But now that we've started, it's actually really liberating to know that while we can mentally drain others on the side, there will always be that deep, strained emotional tension between Peter and I that we will always return to. It's been really great." Fry added that if the arrangement worked out well, the couple may consider having a three-way screaming argument.
