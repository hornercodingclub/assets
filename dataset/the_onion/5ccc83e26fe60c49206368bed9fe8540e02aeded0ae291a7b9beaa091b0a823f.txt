LOS ANGELES--In an effort to provide football fans with a more immersive at-home viewing experience, officials from Fox Sports announced Friday that the network will "mic up" players' tendons during all NFL games this season. "We'll have microphones on select players throughout the league so fans can hear every snap of a blown ACL or a ruptured Achilles tendon," said host Curt Menefee, adding that producers will be able to air the sounds of players' muscle tissue tearing apart immediately after a live play. "With this new addition to our coverage, you'll feel like you're right there on the field for every season-ending injury. It's really the ultimate fan experience." Menefee went on to confirm that the network will also mic up sideline stretchers so viewers can hear the agonized screams of star players being carted off the field.
