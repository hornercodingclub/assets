MALVERN, PA--Making the audacious decision to dine outdoors with her family despite a noticeable lack of umbrellas or awnings, grandmother Diane McGilvery, 83, reportedly gutted it out through lunch Friday on the sunny patio of a local restaurant. "Oh, no, I'm okay," said the octogenarian, assuring her family members that she was "having a nice time" as she boldly persevered through the direct afternoon sunlight. "I'll just have an iced tea. That's all I want. You enjoy your meals." At press time, McGilvery had reportedly begun shivering as a solitary cloud drifted in front of the sun.
