NEW YORK--Don Imus, who was fired from his WFAN morning show in April after calling members of the Rutgers' women's basketball team "nappy-headed hos," returned to the airwaves Monday, citing a deep personal need to make one final "nappy-headed hos" comment. "I have endured eight long months of criticism, shame, and penance, but it will all have been worth it if I get opportunity to once again call a group of female African-American athletes 'nappy-headed hos' for all the world to hear," Imus said on his radio program Monday morning. "After all, calling people 'nappy-headed hos' is why I got into the radio business in the first place." Imus added that, if listeners thought the first time he said "nappy-headed hos" on the air was racially insensitive, they should really tune in tomorrow at around 8:35 a.m.
