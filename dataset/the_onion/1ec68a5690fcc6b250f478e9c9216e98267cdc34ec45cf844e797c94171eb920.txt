GLEN ROSE, TX--Tragedy struck on Saturday as famed former sniper Chris Kyle reportedly was shot and killed at a local gun range, marking a bitter end to the life of a renowned Navy SEAL who had survived long, brutal years in the hellish landscape of the United States. "This man endured countless risks and witnessed indescribable horrors during his extended time in America, but in the end, his luck just ran out," Glen Rose Police Department spokesman James Alvarez said of Kyle, whose shooting death was just one of hundreds of senseless acts of violence recorded in the United States so far this year. "Unfortunately, life here is cruel and unpredictable. Chris' death is a reminder of that." Alvarez added that though Kyle's death is tragic, he hoped it would serve to convince people that it is "high time" all Americans were pulled out of the United States of America entirely.
