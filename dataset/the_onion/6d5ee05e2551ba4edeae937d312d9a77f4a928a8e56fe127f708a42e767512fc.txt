CHICAGO--According to those witnessing the impromptu photo session, an unidentified man taking pictures of Millenium Park's sculpture on his iPad has no idea how incredibly badass he looks. "The way he's holding the iPad all the way out in front of his body like that? Dude looks so awesome he doesn't even realize it," onlooker Jessica Walker, 25, said of the man, who, after taking one photo of the landmark, became the very essence of cool when he hitched up the waistband of his shorts, squatted down, squinted, jutted out his arms and captured a second image of the sculpture. "I don't know who he is, but he reminds of Jay Z or of a 1970s Mick Jagger--maybe even a young Marlon Brando. He's just so fucking smooth, you know?" At press time, the badass had reportedly turned his iPad around to take a picture of himself smiling in front of the artwork.
