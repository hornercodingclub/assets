WASHINGTON--Claiming that he had a "huge honking woody that just won't quit," Vice President Joe Biden interrupted President Barack Obama during the State of the Union tonight, asking the commander-in-chief in a frightened voice if erections exceeding three days required emergency medical attention. "Hey, Barry, sorry to interrupt your speech, man--but is 72 hours too long for a raging boner?" said the perspiring, agitated Biden, nervously motioning to the erection. "I wasn't complaining for the first 36 hours--and neither was she---but this monster is gonna rip my pants at the seams. It hurts, bud. I'm in pecker purgatory over here. Should we call somebody?"At press time, Biden told Speaker of the House John Boehner that he needed to "get his bronco some shut-eye" so it could be "rodeo-ready" by the time "[wife] Jill gets home from the gym tomorrow."
