RIVERSIDE, CA--According to sources close to the former college basketball star, friends of Cheryl Miller once again attempted to set her up on a date with retired Indiana Pacer Reggie Miller on Saturday, apparently still unaware that the two are siblings. "Seriously, you guys have so much in common," said Miller's close friend Danielle Kaelin, stressing that the couple would "really hit it off if [Miller] would just give him a chance." "Reggie loves basketball as much as you do. He played in college and even a few years in the NBA. I won't lie to you Cheryl--he's not the best looking guy out there. But he's still in really great shape for his age, and he's really rich, too." At press time, a resigned Miller begrudgingly agreed to go out on a dinner date next week with her younger brother.
