LYNCHBURG, VA--Noting the addition of some nice new shops and restaurants downtown, local mom Erica Dodson, 52, confirmed during a phone call with her daughter Ashlee today that their hometown actually has a lot going on now. "There's a funky little place that sells fancy olive oil and vinegar, and a wood oven pizzeria where Casey's used to be," said Dodson, who reportedly revealed to her 25-year-old daughter how she read in the paper that Riverside Park would feature free concerts every Thursday during the summer. "You'd be surprised. The farmers market has gotten really big, too, and is coming to the performing arts center." Dodson then reportedly finished the conversation by suggesting that her daughter come home when she has some time and check out the new art gallery in town that has hand-blown glass.
