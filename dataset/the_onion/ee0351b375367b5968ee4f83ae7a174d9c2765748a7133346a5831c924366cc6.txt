RIO DE JANEIRO--Opening up to reporters about the challenging conditions at the Rio Games, U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte admitted Thursday that the Olympic pool is much wetter than he remembered. "Honestly, the pool here feels way more wetter than the one in London," said Lochte, confessing that he had some trouble adjusting to the "bigger wetness" of the pool at Rio's Olympic Aquatics Stadium during his first lap of the men's 4x200 freestyle relay. "The London pool had tons of wet parts, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't as watery. This pool is more of a wetter wet. I was drenched the moment I dove in, and I stayed super soaked the whole time I was in the water. Plus, I was a lot more wet after." Lochte also admitted that until Rio, he didn't think any Olympic pool could possibly be wetter than the one at the 2008 Beijing Games.
