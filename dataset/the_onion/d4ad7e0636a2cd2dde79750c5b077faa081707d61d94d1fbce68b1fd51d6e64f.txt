PHOENIX--Amid widespread criticism over using illegally under-inflated footballs in the AFC Championship Game, coaches and players from the New England Patriots revealed Thursday that they are fully embracing an "Us Against The Rules" mentality heading into Super Bowl XLIX. "At the end of the day, that 'Us Against The Rules' attitude just motivates us to go out there and play our game the way we do best," said quarterback Tom Brady, praising his team's ability to pull together in the face of all the standard rules and regulations in the NFL. "But honestly, it feels like it's us against the rules every season. It certainly felt that way during all the other Super Bowls we've played in, and after a while you just have to own it. It's not always easy, but it's just part of playing for the New England Patriots." Brady went on to credit the mindset for inspiring the team's past success, noting that it is that much more satisfying when the Patriots come out on top.
