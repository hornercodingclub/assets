RANCHO MIRAGE, CA--Just a few days after beginning her court-ordered rehabilitation at the Betty Ford Center, sources close to Lindsay Lohan told reporters today that the troubled actress' rehab stint is off to a fantastic start--oh, wait, she's gone. "I'm happy to report that Lindsay has acknowledged her addictions and is finally serious about getting clean and--hold on, where'd she go?" said Betty Ford substance abuse counselor Tamera White, who claimed that the Hollywood starlet had entered into her 90-day treatment program with enthusiasm, actively engaging in group therapy and showing a genuine desire to break from the habits--except reports now confirm she's not in her room, her purse is gone, and she's running out the front entrance. "Hmm. Okay. Well, better luck next time, I guess." At press time, Lohan has been taken into police custody after crashing her Corvette two blocks away from the recovery center.
