NEW YORK--Claiming that the left-hander was inflicting significant damage to the team, Yankees sources trapped beneath CC Sabathia told reporters Friday that the pitcher was causing harm to the ball club's mental and physical well-being. "He's just crippling this team right now," said an anonymous Yankee player, speaking in muffled, barely audible tones. "We've all felt it, and each day is getting worse and worse. Guys are awfully demoralized and some are clearly giving up. This really hurts. I've never seen the Yankees in such a bad place." At press time, Yankees players confirmed that Sabathia was crushing their hopes of surviving until the postseason.
