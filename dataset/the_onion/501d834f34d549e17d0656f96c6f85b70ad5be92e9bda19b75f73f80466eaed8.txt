CLEVELAND--Following lengthy and protracted trade negotiations, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced Friday that the team has agreed to deal No. 1 draft pick Andrew Wiggins and four-time league MVP LeBron James to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for power forward Kevin Love. "Though it was a tough decision to let Andrew and LeBron go, we felt that adding Kevin gives our team the best chance to compete for an NBA championship next season," said Cleveland GM David Griffin, adding that it ultimately wasn't possible to acquire Love from Minnesota without giving up both Wiggins and James. "We're thrilled to welcome Kevin to the team. I have no doubt that he will be a great fit in Cleveland and will quickly become a fan favorite." Griffin went on to say that everyone within the Cavaliers organization wished Wiggins and James nothing but the best in Minnesota.
