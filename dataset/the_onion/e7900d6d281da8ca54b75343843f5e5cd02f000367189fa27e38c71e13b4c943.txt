BRISTOL, CT--Sports analysts around the world emphatically predicted Monday that 2006 will be the year. "They've made all the right personnel moves, signed some key role players to give them the depth they've really been missing in the playoffs, and made some smart trades and draft picks both this season and years earlier that should provide them with the perfect combination of speed and power," said 's Stuart Scott, echoing the sentiments of over 5,000 sportswriters and experts in every city nationwide. "Their new coach is exactly what this team needs to get them motivated and give their city the championship those fans deserve. And you can quote me on that." Sportswriters are divided, however, on whether this will be the long-awaited first championship in decades, or the continuation of a dynasty.
