The government will remove the paraphrased quotation "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness" from Washington's Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial after many complained the out-of-context words made the civil rights leader sound arrogant. What do think? "This would never have happened to a statue of a white guy." Marybeth McMurry * Rattan Worker "If King didn't want his words to be taken out of context, he never should have said them in the first place." Ryan Charbonneau * Waterproofer "If nobody wants to take credit for the old quote, you can feel free to attribute it to me." Clayton Wynands * Crab Steamer
