BA:LTIMORE--Widely hailed as his franchise's best prospect in years, catcher Matt Wieters fulfilled all expectations last Friday with his first major-league at bat, leading the Baltimore Orioles to their first World Series championship since 1983. "It's an incredible feeling--I'm happy I've lived up to everyone's expectations," said Wieters, who has also retroactively led the Orioles to three division titles and a pennant in the last five years. "Just to step in there in a May game against the Tigers and come back to the dugout with a World Series trophy, an MVP award, and three Gold Gloves? I haven't felt this good since I was voted to the All-Star Game as a sophomore in high school." Wieters became the first rookie to win back-to-back world championships in his second at bat before grounding out in the fifth.
