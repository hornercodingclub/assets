FINDLAY, OH--Following the first four Sweet 16 games of this year's NCAA Tournament, sources at local marketing firm Jones-Brannon Media confirmed Friday that Mark from sales is currently leading the office bracket pool. "Yeah, Mark, the guy who sits over by Caroline and Tim--he's leading with like 64 points or something," said account manager Josh Roffler, who gestured toward a far corner of the office and confirmed that Mark managed to correctly pick Dayton over both Ohio State and Syracuse. "I think he's got Arizona winning it all, but he also had Duke in the Final Four, so who knows. I forget who Scott said is right behind him in second--I just know I need Louisville to come through for me or my bracket's done." At press time, sources clarified that the tall guy with the glasses is not Mark--that's Dave, who isn't even participating in the office pool this year.
