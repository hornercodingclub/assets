NEW YORK--In an interview before today's game against the San Francisco 49ers, Jets head coach Rex Ryan described how quarterbacks Mark Sanchez and Tim Tebow's typically warm-up by throwing passes in each other's general direction. "Mark usually chucks a couple balls over Tim's head, and then Tim throws a few that either fall way short or sail shakily out of bounds," said Ryan, who explained that the exercise helps the quarterbacks settle into their comfort zones. "If they establish a rhythm in warmups and start getting the ball in approximately the right area, it really helps them avoid intentional grounding penalties on the incomplete passes they throw during the game when it counts." At press time, Tebow and Sanchez were working on their agility by running to retrieve all the balls that had rolled under sideline benches.
