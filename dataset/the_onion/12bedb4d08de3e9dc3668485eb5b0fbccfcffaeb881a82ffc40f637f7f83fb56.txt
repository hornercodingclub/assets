NEW YORK--All 30,000 current NCAA men's basketball players, from those who play for Division I powerhouses such as Duke to such lesser-known basketball programs as that of Allegheny County Community College, announced Monday that they were declaring their eligibility for the June 28 NBA Draft. "I figured, well, why not?" said Joshua Ward, a 5'10" sophomore from Eastern Wyoming College. "It can't hurt. Even if I don't get picked, I've never been to New York City, let alone [2007 draft site] Madison Square Garden." NBA Commissioner David Stern remarked Tuesday that he wasn't aware this many kids wanted to become professional basketball players, and as a result was considering creating 3,000 expansion teams for the 2007-08 season.
