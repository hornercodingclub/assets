Sen. (R-Mo.) said he will go to the floor on Friday to ask for a vote on his proposal to provide a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks. "Tomorrow I will go to the Senate floor to ask for an up or down vote on my bill to provide a direct payment of $1200 to working Americans, $2400 for couples, $500 for kids," Hawley . Hawley added that it's "the #covid relief working families need." Hawley introduced legislation earlier this month to provide a second $1,200 stimulus check in language that would mirror language included in the March CARES Act. He's Sen. (I-Vt.) to try to get it passed by the end of the year as part of a sweeping agreement, which is still being negotiated, to fund the government and provide long-stalled coronavirus relief. Under the Senate rules any one senator can ask for a vote but any one senator can object. Hawley, in a separate interview with reporters in the Capitol, didn't rule out that someone blocking his vote could impact if he lets leadership speed up the eventual agreement. In order to speed up votes in the Senate they'll need cooperation from every senator. "It might," Hawley said. "I've said all along I want to have a vote."
