actually newly defined relativistic time not time measured physical clocks longer mathematical variable physical meaning easily verified follows know physical time t relationship relativistic time t einstein special relativity t = tf k f relativistic frequency clock k calibration constant clock uses change status physical process indirectly measure time like use behavior physical time lorentz transformation demonstrate relativistic time t defined lorentz transformation no longer physical time t. clock clock 1 watch clock clock 2 motion clocks set synchronized physical time t relative inertial reference frame clock time t1 = tf1 k1 = t clock time t2 = tf2 k2
