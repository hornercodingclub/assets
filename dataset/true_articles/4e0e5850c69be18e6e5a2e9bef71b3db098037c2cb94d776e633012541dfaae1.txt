Make it three consecutive postponed games for the Phoenix Suns. The NBA announced Thursday that Saturday's game between the Suns and Indiana Pacers at Phoenix Suns Arena has been postponed "because of ongoing contact tracing within the Suns, the team does not have the league-required eight available players." This is in accordance with the NBA's health and safety protocols, which has received additional measures in a reaction to spike in COVID-19 cases throughout the country and NBA teams having players needing quarantines. The Suns (7-4) haven't played since Monday's 128-107 loss at Washington to end a three-game road trip. They were scheduled to begin a three-game homestand Wednesday against Atlanta, but the game was postponed the morning of the game for the same reason that Friday's game against Golden State and now Saturday's game against the Pacers have been postponed. Phoenix went into Monday's game listing rookie Jalen Smith out due to health and safety protocols, but he wasn't in Washington as he didn't make the road trip. "Because of ongoing tracing within the Suns, the team does not have the league-required eight available players to proceed,'' the NBA said in a statement announcing the Atlanta-Phoenix postponement on Wednesday. Suns officials told The Arizona Republic after the postponement Wednesday the team must receive "the green light" from the NBA to resume playing games.
