Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.   By      December 8, 2020 1:36pm   Bill Nye "the Science Guy" has a new part to play: mask compliance guy. In a last week, the 65-year-old entertainer-educator demonstrated how face masks work to prevent coronavirus infection -- with props seemingly pulled from around the home. In four days, the clip has racked up 3.9 million views on the social platform. "I don't know who needs to hear this but... #masks work. Wear one. Carry on...," Nye captioned the video. He begins by holding a map of the US up to the camera, depicting the prevalence of COVID-19 compared to the popularity of masks. The maps show that regions where masks are worn the least are also where coronavirus has sickened people at higher rates. "I hope you can see the fewer the masks, more the sick," he says. Next, Nye explains how a mask works -- by "trapping" the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen in its fibers. "There's a perception that a virus can travel through the fibers of a mask," he says. But "viruses don't travel by themselves. No, they travel in droplets of spit and snot." Masks are composed of a "tangle" of fibers, he continues. "So when the droplet gets into the fibers of a mask, it gets trapped." "This is not that hard to understand, everybody," he says. He also ribbed those who claim masks muffle, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who recently at a Michigan House of Representatives Oversight Committee hearing last week to remove her mask so people could "hear [her] more clearly." State legislators told the woman that she could be heard just fine. Like Michigan lawmakers, Nye says in mock surprise, "Oh, you can hear me fine, right through the mask!" This isn't Nye's first mask missive. In July, a pair of videos on TikTok in which he calls mask wearing " a matter of life and death."     Share Selection
