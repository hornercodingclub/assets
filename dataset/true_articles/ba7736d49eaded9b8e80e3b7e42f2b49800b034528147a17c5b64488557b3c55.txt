Cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body, causes many diseases, and reduces the health of smokers in general. Quitting smoking lowers your risk for smoking-related diseases and can add years to your life. Smokers are at greater risk for diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease). Smoking can cause lung disease by damaging your airways and the small air sacs (alveoli) found in your lungs.
