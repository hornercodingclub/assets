Charter." "Most Americans, myself included, reject 1930s-style isolationism. They expect to see the strong hand of American leadership in world affairs, and they know that economic retreat would yield nothing other than a lower standard of living," Biden wrote. "They understand further that many security threats -- the spread of high-tech weapons, environmental degradation, overpopulation, narcotics trafficking, migration -- require global solutions." Biden explained that the New World Order is not as prosaic as empires past, preferring to assert its dominance through economic leverage rather than brute force. "What about America as globocop? First, our 21st-century strategy has to be a shade more clever than Mao's axiom that power comes from the barrel of a gun," Biden wrote. "Power also emanates from a solid bank balance, the ability to dominate and penetrate markets, and the economic leverage to wield diplomatic clout." Biden's plan for America has been out in the open for decades: launch endless wars, surrender U.S. sovereignty to the U.N., and economically crush any nation that resists the globalist takeover. . posted 6 hours ago posted 7 hours ago posted 10 hours ago posted a day ago
