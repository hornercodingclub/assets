This is getting so annoying...but at least they are proving me right...80 million did note vote for Basement.  Even Instagram has to force you to follow his illegitimate White House page. Some users tried unfollowing and even blocking the Biden White House account, but were unable to do so. "Hoping you pick up this story. If you unfollow or block the White House Instagram account, hours later you are forced to follow it again," a reader   . "More than half of the followers are being forced to follow the page.  Seems like Instagram is trying to avoid the mainstream media picking up on Biden having less than a million followers." So, Biden reportedly won a record 80 million votes, but can't even get a following of one million people on Instagram unless through Big Tech shenanigans? Does anybody still really believe that Biden legitimately won 80 million votes? posted 7 hours ago posted 10 hours ago posted 21 hours ago posted a day ago
