It comes despite Government guidance published last year which advised schools to exercise caution when teaching children about gender issues. The programme, which features children asking adults about sexuality and gender on behalf of their peers, suggests the different identities include 'bi-gender', 'gender-queer' and 'pansexual'. The film also tells children that becoming transgender is a way to be 'happy' while making no mention of the growing legal and medical concerns about the rising number of children saying they want to change gender. A majority of school-age children are currently being forced to resort to online learning because the lockdown has shut access to the classrooms for all but key workers. Last night, the BBC said teachers were 'strongly advised' to watch the film before viewing it with their pupils. posted 9 hours ago posted a day ago posted a day ago posted a day ago
