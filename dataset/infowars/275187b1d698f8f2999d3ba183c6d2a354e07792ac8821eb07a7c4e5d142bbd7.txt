Also, illegal aliens who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border on or after November 1, 2020, can still be deported. Still, the order is expected to keep most of all illegal aliens in the U.S. who would have been deported over the next 100 days. Analysis from Center for Immigration Studies Policy Director Jessica Vaughan that about 88 percent of illegal aliens deported in 2018 were not aggravated felons. This indicates that nearly 9-in-10 illegal aliens will be shielded from deportation for at least 100 days because they have yet to be convicted of an aggravated felony. "This is a drastic and unprecedented order," Vaughan wrote in her analysis. "Out of all interior deportations, the number of cases classified as 'not aggravated felons' in 2018 was 83,804," Vaughan notes. "This was 88 percent of all interior deportations." posted 9 hours ago posted 12 hours ago posted 21 hours ago posted a day ago
