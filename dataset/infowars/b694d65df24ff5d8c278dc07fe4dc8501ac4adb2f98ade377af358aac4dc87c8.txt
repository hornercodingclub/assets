An investigation was opened , "You need to check out Dr. Mosca. He's mad. He's killing patients to free up beds." , nurses at the hospital accused "crazy" Mosca of pumping lethal doses of anesthetics into the deceased patients. The doctor used Succinylcholine and Propofol, typically used on patients who are set to be intubated, but prosecutors say the patients who died were never intubated. Dr. Mosca allegedly messaged his colleagues, asking them to "agree on a convenient version of the story." Speaking with each other via WhatsApp, the nurses asked, "Did he ask you to administer the drugs without intubating them?", "I'm not killing patients just because he wants to free up the beds," and "This is crazy." A nurse who claims he told colleagues to leave the room before administering the drugs, said, "This has never happened to me before." Police have started to investigate another three deaths at the hospital after indications that Mosca may have altered the medical records of victims to conceal the truth. Mosca, who calls the claims "baseless," was arrested and is now under house arrest until the courts decide his fate.
