Joe Biden struggles to put his pen in his pocket The pen incident occurred while Biden was feverishly reversing every possible executive order from the previous administration, including restoring racist and factually inaccurate anti-white critical race theory training for government employees that was halted by President Trump in 2020. Biden has set records for executive orders during his first week in office, weakening his already poor job approval ratings. The Biden administration took five days to disavow violent left-wing rioting in Portland, : Antifa took to the streets in both Portland, Oregon and Seattle Washington on January 20, only hours after Joe Biden was inaugurated, where they destroyed the Portland, Oregon Democrat Party Headquarters, and scrawled "f**k Biden" on one of the few intact windows near the building's entrance. It took the Biden administration's Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, five days to disavow the left wing violence. When asked by a reporter about the violent episode that saw American Flags looted and burned and the Democrat Party of Portland, Oregon headquarters trashed, Psaki offered a brief disavowal for the left wing political violence that - in part - targeted her boss, the sitting U.S. President. "President Biden condemns violence and any violence in the strongest possible terms," Psaki told the journalist. "Peaceful protests are a cornerstone of our democracy, but smashing windows is not protesting, and neither is looting." The Biden team has not publicly commented on the President's inability to put his pen in his suit pocket. posted 9 hours ago posted 9 hours ago posted 9 hours ago posted 10 hours ago
