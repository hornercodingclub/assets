"As governor, I will defend your right to be free of socialism and tyranny; your Second Amendment right to keep your family safe and your freedom of speech and religious liberty." "Our state needs a leader with the courage to do what's right, not what's politically correct or convenient," she continued. "I've been tested under fire, successfully managing one crisis after another, in one of the most difficult, high-pressure jobs in all of government," Sanders said.  "At the table with President Trump, confronting our most dangerous adversaries like China and North Korea." Sanders' father, Mike Huckabee, served as the Republican Governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. The current Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson is term-limited and cannot seek re-election to a third term. Sanders is expected to face primaries from several other Republican candidates but is largely viewed as the leading contender. posted 6 hours ago posted 10 hours ago posted 21 hours ago posted a day ago
