Dowd suggested that "other countries have gone through this before, Germany, Japan, South Africa, and the thing before you get to reconciliation and healing, you have some element of truth and accountability in this." Dowd continued the demented train of thought by bringing the Civil War into the conversation. "And even besides those foreign country examples, we have an example in our country during reconstruction in the aftermath of the Civil War when we went through -- we were supposed to go through a process of truth and accountability and changing the nature of what went on," he said. Along with Dowd, a rogue's gallery of talking heads also bayed for Trump to be punished in the same way war criminals would be. "We have to have an insight into the truth before we get to reconciliation and healing," Dowd proclaimed. When New Jersey Governor Chris Christie argued that there has been more violence on the left through the past four years, the panel attempted to argue that Antifa and BLM destruction is morally justifiable. "One is defending the Constitution and the organizing principles and values of this country, and also prosecuting people who committed property crimes. And if you draw a moral equivalence you're morally lost," former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel declared. In other words, 'It's OK when we do it'. posted 16 hours ago posted 18 hours ago posted 19 hours ago posted 19 hours ago
