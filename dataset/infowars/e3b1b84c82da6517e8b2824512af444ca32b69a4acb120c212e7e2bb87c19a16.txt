Don Jr. says he took over a channel on the end-to-end encrypted messenger after Silicon Valley oligarchs banned his father President Donald Trump from virtually every platform earlier this month. "Big Tech has gotten out of hand and it's clear that many of you would like to connect on a platform that doesn't stifle Free Speech - I hear you," Don Jr. said in a message. "I now have ownership of this channel and will be posting original content for you guys." See Don Jr's message below: Earlier this month, President Trump was censored by numerous social media apps, including Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Twitch, Shopify and YouTube, which claimed he might use their platforms to incite violence after the January 6 breach at the US Capitol. In the meantime, liberals have set their sights on alternative social media apps like Telegram and Gab, after the cancel culture crowd was successfully able to de-platform Twitter competitor Parler. It remains to be seen whether President Trump will be popping in for cameos on Don's Telegram, or whether the president will get his own channel.
