Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Fish oil is the best-known source for these fats, but seafood may also contain high levels of mercury. To grow their fishy pigs, a team of scientists inserted a gene into fetal pig cells that gives rise to connective tissue. These cells were cloned to generate piglets with omega-3 levels that are three times higher than normal. Future tests must assess whether the levels remain high into adulthood.
