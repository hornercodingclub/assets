practical implementation quantum illumination paper submitted 2008 building theoretical work presented september 12 actually proving effect real challenge easy creating entangled photons shoot light special downconverting crystal acts beam splitter produces separate linked rays ray illuminates object serves reference returning reference beams merged basically making splitter reverse photons entangled likely recombine upconvert experiment prove quantum illumination boost sensitivity imaging use weak signals creating materials capable upconverting faint beams high efficiency technically daunting kumar says lloyd predicts experimental tests scheme come later year boosting imaging sensitivity effect confer benefits quantum computing quantum cryptography kumar suspects quantum world exotic complex shows surprises
