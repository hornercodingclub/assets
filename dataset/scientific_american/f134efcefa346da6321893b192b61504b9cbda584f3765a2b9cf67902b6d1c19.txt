Read Our Latest Issue "Newt Skywalker" nudges out Romney and Paul based on the former congressman's engagement in issues related to energy, the Internet and military weapons The contenders for the Republican nomination in the 2012 U.S. presidential election may appear to be a fairly uniform group of middle-aged white conservatives, but when it comes to issues of science, technology and overall geek cred, none of these candidates is cut from the same cloth. In fact, Newt Gingrich nudges out Mitt Romney and Ron Paul in 's overall ranking, based on the former Congressman's engagement in issues related to energy, the Internet and military weapons, combined with his mastery of top online tools such as Twitter and a healthy appetite for science nonfiction. Paul is a geek contender based on his appeal to libertarian-leaning Silicon Valley, combined with his support of online freedoms, although he fails science when it comes to accepting evidence for anthropogenic climate change and evolution. Romney accepts evolution, accepts at least the phenomenon of climate change, if not the science showing that it is human-caused, and has deeper ties to Silicon Valley. He also has thought extensively about energy, technology and engineering issues to the point that he explicitly favors a federal program for advanced energy research. All candidates were ranked with up to five stars in three broad categories: "Geekiness" is an evaluation of whether or not the candidate qualifies as a geek. "Associations" encapsulates the degree to which he or she has been attached to causes and people in science and technology. And "policies" sums up the degree to which the candidate engages those subjects in his or her platforms. Read on for a deep dive into the GOP candidates' personal histories, public statements and policy proposals, which gives a unique window into their understanding of the issues closest to geeks' hearts and of how the universe works. # 1 - Newt Gingrich The two things you need to know about Gingrich's geek cred is that and that he --back in its early, weird days--in a feature written by none other than technology investor and commentator . Bob Walker, a Gingrich booster and former chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Science (now the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology), said that Gingrich " ." Calling Gingrich a science-fiction nerd is like saying that vampires have seen a modest resurgence in young adult literature. He has repeatedly expressed that Isaac Asimov's seminal trilogy (about "psychohistorians" who use mathematical models to predict the future) . Gingrich has written so much and spoken so often that it is possible to confuse the volume of his pronouncements with their frequency, but some of his ideas appear to come straight from the science fiction he has read. He has proposed , putting , , reviving a Star Wars-style orbiting missile defense system and solving climate change . Whereas other candidates wring their hands over the threat of Chinese currency controls, he has warned of the threat to the U.S. of that most science-fictionesque of all weapons, . Gingrich's American Solutions for think tank, which he left when he announced his run for president and that has , . Through the organization, he once proposed that citizens could become more involved in government through wikis and " ."  has six times as many followers on Twitter as , and via social media. He has . And he was once a top 500 reviewer on Amazon, , including by Brian Greene, by Richard P. Feynman and by Matt Ridley. Gingrich but on the subject. He is knowledgeable about climate change and . Recently he reportedly backed away from including a chapter on climate change in a forthcoming book about the environment. When it comes to science policy, Gingrich, like Romney, contends that we need to . He thinks students who graduate early should receive the cost of the year they skipped as a scholarship and that online learning should be universally available. He also wants to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency and replace it with an Environmental Solutions Agency that would ." Geekiness ***** Policies ***** Associations **** TOTAL: 14 #2 - Mitt Romney Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, has a "corny sense of humor," but being socially awkward is not a sufficient qualification for ascendance to the rank of geek. Still, rare glimpses of Romney in unguarded moments suggest that beneath his image as a successful businessman beats the heart of the sort of brainy young man who excelled at Harvard University. In 2007, for example, he told an interviewer that by L. Ron Hubbard. (He was quick to add that he had no affinity for Scientology, which was founded by Hubbard.) Romney's ties to technology and Silicon Valley are surprisingly deep for a businessman who spent most of his career on the East Coast. Speaking in Redmond, Wash., Romney was reminded that he , now head of Microsoft, for a different job. In 2010 he for his father's old job as governor of Michigan. Meg Whitman, head of Hewlett-Packard and former head of eBay, is one of his most prominent fund-raisers, and the two are so close that some have should he win. Scott McNealy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, is also . The technology portion of Romney's platform does not appear to have changed much since his run in 2008, "It is time to invest substantially in technologies related to power generation, nanotechnology and materials science." He has added provisions to his "human capital" plank that would raise existing caps on visas given to highly skilled workers, as well as grant permanent residency to graduates with advanced degrees in math, science and engineering. Romney is explicitly in favor of the by-all-accounts-successful Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy's program for advanced energy research but, unsurprisingly, he is not in favor of support for alternative energy beyond the R&D phase. (See: a little .) When it comes to the environment, Romney hews to the party line, which ranges from tilting EPA rules heavily in favor of the industries it regulates (Romney) to transforming the entire agency into a smoldering heap of ashes and greenhouse gas emissions (Paul and Michele Bachmann). Specifically, Romney would like environmental regulations to be " ," with "a regulatory cap of zero dollars on all federal agencies." It is on the pace and causes of climate change, but he promises to amend the Clean Air Act to specifically exclude regulation of carbon emissions. Romney has made it clear that .

So perhaps he is better described as a wonk? Compared with the wider public, . He exhibits no particular tech savvy himself--and shows an occasionally . But in terms of popularity, Paul dominated the Internet early, , during which technology was the . He is the only current GOP candidate to have , where he was warmly received. Paul benefits from the libertarian leanings of the technology community in general, which includes such notables as SpaceX founder Elon Musk and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who wants to . Paul is . When it comes to policy, Paul is notable for what he proposes to eliminate rather than for what he wants to add or remake in the federal budget. This characteristic makes it difficult to compare him with Romney and Gingrich, who have promised to support basic research despite overall cuts in discretionary spending. Whether or not Paul's policies are proinnovation depends on whether you think existing regulations and subsidies help or hinder the U.S.'s ability to bring new ideas to market. For example, Paul is , something that climate policy experts and more than a few multinational companies are nearly unanimous in supporting. This view is at least congruent with , which puts him at odds with pretty much every climate scientist on the planet and . He would and encourage victims to use the courts to punish polluters instead. For geeks with an interest in privacy, Paul is unique among his peers in his ardent support of online freedoms. He is against national ID systems and universal health records, and he favors legalization of some drugs. In other words, it is hard to imagine President Paul signing any bills that would, for example, interfere with fans of cryptographic currency Bitcoin using it to buy whatever they like, . It is , but past statements . Geekiness *** Policies *** Associations ***** TOTAL: 11 #4 - Rick Perry Perry is not a geek. Given his hardscrabble upbringing in Texas and subsequent tour of duty as an Air Force flight jock, the candidate appears to be the mold that no one realized former president George W. Bush was attempting to pour himself into. Perry dropped out of the pre-vet track in college . Without confusing secular humanism and geekiness, it is worth noting that he is very public about how faith . In the debates, Perry distinguished himself by comparing the persecution of a 17th-century astronomer by a powerful religious and political body . Scientists whom he claims to speak for do not agree with his judgment that they doubt "the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change." Confusion in Perry's assessment of the climate and energy nexus extends to his , which says that "we must continue to invest in clean coal technology through research and development tax incentives." If, as Perry has claimed, climate change is a baseless hoax, it makes no sense that he should advocate for a technology explicitly designed to capture and sequester carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants for the sole purpose of averting the warming effect of those emissions. Perry wants to cut the size of the Department of Education in half by consolidating its functions, and his energy policy is big on states' rights and freeing oil and gas companies to access existing resources. Texas has more wind power than any other state in the nation (and therefore almost every other country on Earth), so it is worth noting that his hands-off approach--for example, Texas has a deregulated energy market--has not hurt that industry in his home state. Perry has trumpeted his own $200-million Emerging Technology Fund, which hands out no-strings-attached grants to fledgling companies, as a major driver of science and technology jobs in Texas. News outlets of just about   , however, have pilloried the ETF as " " designed to reward CEOs who have donated to Perry's political campaigns. Perry says that evolution is a "theory" with "gaps in it" and that, in Texas, " ."

That said, Santorum did once trilogy in an analogy that showed that he saw the movies, if not read the books. His platform is a , except for what is apparently a nod to his belief that is a bad idea--a view he shares with Paul and Bachmann. Aside from a broad commitment to budget cuts, Santorum has argued that in order to create more jobs. Santorum's Web site is poorly organized and he has failed since 2003 to get it to rank higher in Google searches than a Web site launched by sex columnist Dan Savage that .

She claimed that the vaccine against HPV that Perry made mandatory during his tenure as governor of Texas leads to mental disability. Doctors were so incensed they , and scientists said her statements had set back public understanding and acceptance of the vaccine . Unsurprisingly, Bachmann's antiscience tendencies extend to evolution and climate science. She and has called climate science "manufactured science" that will lead to a .
