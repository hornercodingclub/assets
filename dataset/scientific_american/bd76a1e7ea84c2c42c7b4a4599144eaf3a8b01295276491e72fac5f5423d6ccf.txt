Read Our Latest Issue Scientific American Photosynthesis evolved early in Earth's history. The rapidity of its emergence suggests it was no fluke and could arise on other worlds, too. As organisms released gases that changed the very lighting conditions on which they depended, they had to evolve new colors. Formation of Earth First photosynthetic bacteria They absorbed near-infrared rather than visible light and produced sulfur or sulfate compounds rather than oxygen. Their pigments (possibly  bacteriochlorophylls) were predecessors to chlorophyll. First rock evidence of atmospheric oxygen Cyanobacteria These ubiquitous bacteria were the first oxygen producers. They absorb visible light using a mix of pigments: phycobilins, carotenoids and several forms of chlorophyll. Red and brown algae These organisms have more complex cellular structures than bacteria do. Like cyanobacteria, they contain phycobilin pigments as well as various forms of chlorophyll. Green algae Green algae do better than red and brown algae in the strong light of shallow water. They make do without phycobilins. First land plants Mosses and liverworts descended from green algae. Lacking vascular structure (stems and roots) to pull water from the soil, they are unable to grow tall. Vascular plants These are literally garden-variety plants, such as ferns, grasses, trees and cacti. They are able to grow tall canopies to capture more light.  September 13, 2016  --  Nancy Y.
