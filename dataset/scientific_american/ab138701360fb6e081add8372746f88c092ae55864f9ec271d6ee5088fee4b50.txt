Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue have carbon electrodes, which are relatively bulky for the energy they provide. To slim electrodes down, researchers have turned to that paragon of self-assembly, the virus. A team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineered a long tubular virus called M13 to sheathe itself in proteins that glom onto cobalt and gold atoms. The scientists dipped a polymer electrolyte film into a solution containing the virus, then into a solution of metal atoms, yielding a thin, transparent sheet coated in cobalt oxide and gold. The result, an electrode, stores almost three times as much energy as the carbon-based kind, the researchers reported online April 6 in . Next, the goal is to build a counter electrode and, ultimately, a self-assembling battery.
