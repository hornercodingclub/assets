Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Discovery lies at the core of science, but rediscovery can be just as important. Indiana University Bloomington researchers combed through 22 million scientific papers published over the past century and found, to their surprise, dozens of "Sleeping Beauties"--studies that sat dormant for years and then suddenly got noticed. The top finds--the ones that languished in obscurity the longest and later got the most intense attention from the scientific community--came from chemistry, physics and statistics. What tended to wake up these sleeping findings? Scientists from other disciplines, such as the medical field, in search of fresh insights, as well as the ability to test once theoretical postulations. Qing Ke, a graduate student in informatics who worked on the project, says that most likely Sleeping Beauties will become even more common in the future because of the increasing availability and accessibility of scientific literature. #2: "Preparation of Graphitic Oxide"  (April 2008) #4: "Wettability of Porous Surfaces"  (August 2008) (April 2011) (Both articles discuss the Cassie-Baxter law of wetting, which explains that increasing the roughness of a surface can increase its water repellency.) #5: "A study of the Nucleation and Growth Processes in the Synthesis of Colloidal Gold"  (June 2008)  (November 2001) #9: "Resistance of Solid Surfaces to Wetting by Water"  (March 2003)  (November 2008) #11: "The Constitution and Fundamental Properties of Solids and Liquids"  , Irving Langmuir (1920, 1933, 1937). #14: "Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?"
