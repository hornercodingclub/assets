Neuroscientists at Washington University in St. Louis put 21 volunteers in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine and asked them to recall or imagine events, such as seeing themselves at a party with Bill Clinton. Eight different regions displayed extra activity--that is, increased blood flow--when dealing with imagining the future, including Brodmann's area, the medial posterior parietal cortex and the posterior cerebellum. An additional 15 regions played a role in either remembering the past or imagining the future, including those previously identified as important for remembering locations already visited. The USA published the study online January 1.
