Romantic relationships between Faces stand in for diplomatic treaties, and the beauty and popularity of a representative determine the nation's standing on the world stage. In this atmosphere, the Face of the United Amazonian Rainforest Confederation escapes an assassination attempt with the help of a paparazzo and must uncover the humanity behind other Faces to survive. The action-packed story and thorough characterization in Valentine's sardonic novel offer a view on a not so different world from our own, where a celebrity-obsessed populace can ignore the real issues affecting people around the globe.
