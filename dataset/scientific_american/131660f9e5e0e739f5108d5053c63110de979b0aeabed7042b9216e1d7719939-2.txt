uranium occurs mixture isotopes easily fissionable uranium 235 said fissile stable uranium 238 uranium fire atomic reactor ignited sustained neutrons nucleus fissile atom hit neutron especially slow moving likely cleave fission releasing substantial amounts energy neutrons emitted neutrons strike nearby fissile atoms causing break apart propagating nuclear chain reaction resulting heat conveyed reactor turns water steam run turbine drives electric generator uranium 238 not fissile called fissionable splits hit fast neutron said fertile uranium 238 atom absorbs neutron splitting transmutes plutonium 239 like uranium 235 fissile sustain chain reaction years service technicians typically remove fuel today reactors radiation related degradation
