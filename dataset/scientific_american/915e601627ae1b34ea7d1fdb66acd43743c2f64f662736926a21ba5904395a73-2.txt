simply chemical reaction anode releases electrons reaction cathode absorbs electrical path provided electrolyte external electrical circuit connects anode cathode simultaneous reactions proceed electrons freed anode travel external electrical connection react chemically cathode cell function cell continue discharge electrodes run reagents respective reactions primary cell means end useful life secondary cell means time recharge secondary cells recharge process reverse discharge process external source direct electrical current supplies electrons anode removes cathode forcing chemical reactions reverse cell recharged constitutes simplified explanation electrochemical energy stored cell removed electrical energy process discharging restored process recharging secondary cell electrochemical thermal processes taking place time practical
