Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Recommendations from by Bianca Nogrady Random House Australia, 2014 (($19.95)) Although everyone dies, no one alive fully knows what the experience is like. Nogrady, a journalist, describes what science says about the goings-on in the mind and body at death and investigates phenomena that lack good explanations, such as seeing a light at the end of a tunnel. She also examines the politics of death, such as the debate over euthanasia, as well as personal accounts of people who have had near-death experiences or have watched a loved one die. Nogrady's book offers a comprehensive reflection on everything we know--and what we can only guess--about the end.
