Read Our Latest Issue Bug-based coating could neutralize toxins Chemical engineer Robert E. Cohen and materials scientist Michael F. Rubner seeded a polymer thin film with rows of silica nanoparticles and coated the surface with a fluorinated chemical that aggressively repels water. They then attached acid molecules to the nanoparticles, forming rows of nodes (like lights lining the sides of airport runways) that strongly attract water. Vapor molecules run off the hydrophobic runways and coalesce into droplets at the hydrophilic nodes. As the droplets grow, they fuse and run off in straight channels to be collected at the film's edge. This is a preview. Make a selection below to access this issue.Already have access? .
