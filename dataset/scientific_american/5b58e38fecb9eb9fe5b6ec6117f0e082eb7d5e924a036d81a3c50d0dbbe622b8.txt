Every year the sides of the island nation's Alpine Fault shift past one another about 30 millimeters--a blistering speed for strike-slip faults, which typically slip at rates closer to one or two millimeters a year. "What is particularly interesting about the Alpine Fault is that it has maintained this high slip rate for almost its entire history," says Simon Lamb, a geologist at the Victoria University of Wellington. "As far as I can tell, no other one land fault comes close in this respect." In fact, the Alpine Fault has shifted approximately 700 kilometers over the past 25 million years--250 kilometers more than previously estimated, according to Lamb's new study in . That movement has seismic consequences: New Zealand has a 30 percent chance for an earthquake of magnitude eight or higher in the next 50 years.
