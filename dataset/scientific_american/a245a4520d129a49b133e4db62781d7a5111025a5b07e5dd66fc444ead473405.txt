Read Our Latest Issue Our universe may have started not with a big bang but with a big bounce--an implosion that triggered an explosion, all driven by exotic quantum-gravitational effects Atoms are now such a commonplace idea that it is hard to remember how radical they used to seem. When scientists first hypothesized atoms centuries ago, they despaired of ever observing anything so small, and many questioned whether the concept of atoms could even be called scientific. Gradually, however, evidence for atoms accumulated and reached a tipping point with Albert Einstein's 1905 analysis of Brownian motion, the random jittering of dust grains in a fluid. Even then, it took another 20 years for physicists to develop a theory explaining atoms--namely, quantum mechanics--and another 30 for physicist Erwin Muller to make the first microscope images of them. Today entire industries are based on the characteristic properties of atomic matter. This is a preview. Make a selection below to access this issue.Already have access? .
