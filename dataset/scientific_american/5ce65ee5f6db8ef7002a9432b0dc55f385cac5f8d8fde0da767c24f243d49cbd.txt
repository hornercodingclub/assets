One device consists of layers of gallium arsenide and aluminum arsenide that emit and partially trap sound vibrations in the solid (phonons) oscillating in the terahertz range. A voltage creates a burst of phonons, which reverberate and multiply, and the amplified ultrasound exits one end. Physicists describe this so-called saser, for sound laser, in the June 2 . In the "uaser" (pronounced "wayzer"), piezoelectric oscillators vibrate an aluminum block, which feeds back into the oscillators and locks the vibrations into a single megahertz frequency. The system generates multidirectional ultrasound and might aid in studying so-called random lasers that likewise produce scattered, coherent light, co-designer Richard Weaver of the University of Illinois informed the Acoustical Society of America on June 8.
