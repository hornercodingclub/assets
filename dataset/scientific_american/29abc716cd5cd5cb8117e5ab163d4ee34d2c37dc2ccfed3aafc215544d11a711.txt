"Despite the (often overhyped) advances of fMRI and other brain-scanning technologies, injuries remain the best, and only, way to infer certain things about the brain," writes journalist Kean. In this compilation of patients' stories, he details some of the unexpected truths revealed by accidents: "Destroy one small node of neurons, and people lose the ability to recognize fruits and vegetables, but not other food. Destroy another node and they lose the ability to read--even though they can still write." Beyond paying tribute to the scientific advances these patients made possible, Kean humanizes the patients themselves.
