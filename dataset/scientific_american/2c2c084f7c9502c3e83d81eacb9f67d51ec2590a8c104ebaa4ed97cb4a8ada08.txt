Read Our Latest Issue A program to stop deadly diseases from spreading to the U.S. by helping foreign countries contain them now faces steep cuts When Ebola occurred in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea between 2014 and 2016, it spread widely because those countries did not have the public health systems they needed to stop the virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with other international and national institutions, helped to supply material and expertise essential to end that outbreak. To prevent this kind of disease disaster from happening again, the U.S. government then ramped up its global infectious disease preparedness as part of a new international initiative called the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). Many international health efforts aim to improve the response to one disease, but the GHSA builds infrastructure that can control a broad range of biological threats. Though focused on developing countries, the initiative directly helps the U.S. because, unchecked, diseases such as Ebola will reach America's shores. This work, done mostly through the CDC and the U.S. Agency for International Development, has produced hundreds of valuable interventions directed at enhancing countries' capacities to detect, prevent and respond to dangerous infections.
