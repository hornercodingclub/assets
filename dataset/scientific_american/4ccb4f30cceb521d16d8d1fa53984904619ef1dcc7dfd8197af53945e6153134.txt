But budget shortfalls added two years to development schedules, and then technical problems with parachutes and launch escape systems pushed key flight tests to 2019. Now SpaceX--the company selected along with Boeing in 2014 to fly crews to and from the International Space Station--is finally on the cusp of launching two NASA astronauts on a long-awaited trial run.
