Exposures "do not all add collectively at any one point in space," says Jerrold T. Bushberg, head of health physics programs at the University of California, Davis. And average exposure is still far below safety standards, which have a large margin built in. .  Mark Fischetti is a senior editor at . He covers all aspects of sustainability.
