Gary Greenberg, a research affiliate at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy, took this 3-D stereo image (cross your eyes slightly until there are three images, then focus on the center) of a single grain of moon sand (magnified here about 300 times). It reveals a ring created by a micrometeorite that struck it. The impact resulted in melting, and as the particle quickly cooled, it created a glassy structure. Greenberg and his colleagues hope viewing these grains in greater detail may help scientists learn more about the moon's evolution. 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
