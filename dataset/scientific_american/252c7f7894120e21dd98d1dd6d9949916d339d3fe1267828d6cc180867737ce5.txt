Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in August 1958 "Subliminal stimulation has become a public issue since a commercial research firm announced that it can be used to sell popcorn and Coca-Cola to movie theater audiences. Last month three psychologists of the University of Michigan presented their views on the technology and ethics of subliminal advertising in The American Psychologist. The authors dismiss the theater test as vague and uncontrolled. They also point out that their code of ethics forbids using psychological techniques for 'devious purposes' and observe that through 'a kind of guilt by association' psychologists may come into disrepute because of the public revulsion against subliminal advertising." -- , August 1958 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our . 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
