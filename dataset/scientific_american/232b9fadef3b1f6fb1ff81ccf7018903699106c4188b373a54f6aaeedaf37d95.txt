Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in May 1962 "Within the past year or so the merest glimpse has been obtained of the universe as revealed by the very-high-energy photons called gamma rays. The glimpse has been provided by fewer than 100 energetic photons, recorded by a gamma ray 'telescope' carried into orbit on April 27, 1961, by the artificial satellite Explorer XI.

The analysis is still continuing in a laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology." -- , May 1962 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our shiny . 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
