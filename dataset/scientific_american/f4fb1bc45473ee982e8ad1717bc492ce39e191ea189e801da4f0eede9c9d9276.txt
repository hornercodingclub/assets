In 1998 one biologist ventured that the tentacled creatures, by continually renewing their own cells, may stave off aging altogether to achieve a kind of biological immortality. More recently, the species was one of a few dozen organisms included in a study of aging diversity. Whereas female fertility in humans spikes early, then tapers off, and mortality rises sharply as we age, plenty of organisms follow a different path. The water flea, for example, experiences fluctuations in fertility throughout its life span and a more gradual rise in mortality. But the hydra takes the prize for life-cycle oddity. The polyp's mortality appears to remain low for an indefinite period, the researchers reported in . ( is part of Nature Publishing Group.) In a controlled laboratory setting, they estimated that 5 percent of a hydra population would still be alive after 1,400 years.
