Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue His statements show a disregard for science that is alarming in a candidate for high office One of the major-party presidential candidates has had plenty to say during this year's campaign. But almost none of the words from Donald J. Trump have been about the importance of science and science literacy to the nation's economic growth, security and international prestige--as well as to the health and well-being of the American people and the future of the planet itself. Trump has, however, made statements about science over the years, many of them in the form of tweets. They betray his beliefs about scientific issues, so we are reprinting a selection of them here. We have not fact-checked them. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. [ ] This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps, and our GW scientists are stuck in ice [ ] NBC News just called it the great freeze--coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX? [ ] Any and all weather events are used by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our planet! They don't believe it $$$$! [ ] Global warming is based on faulty science and manipulated data which is proven by the emails that were leaked [ ] Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee--I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax! [ ] I've seen people where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations, and a month later the child is no longer healthy. [ ] Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try. [ ] Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes--AUTISM. Many such cases! [ ] The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great--but must suffer the consequences! [ ] Same CDC which is bringing Ebola to US misplaced samples of anthrax earlier this year ...Be careful. [ ] ObamaCare gives free insurance to illegal immigrants. Yet @BarackObama is cutting our troops healthcare. Outrageous. [ ] Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans' healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes. Just think about that. [ ] Fracking poses ZERO health risks In fact, it increases our national security by making us energy independent. [ ] It would be nice if our commander-in-chief was as concerned for our Veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens. [ ] Not only are wind farms disgusting looking, but even worse they are bad for people's health They should be outlawed and allowed only in heavily industrialized areas. [ ] Seems to be the next election must be about jobs and gas prices--not birth control. [ ] Remember, new "environment friendly" lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful--the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
