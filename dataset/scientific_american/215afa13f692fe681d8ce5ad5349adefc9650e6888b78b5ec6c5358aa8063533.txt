Read Our Latest Issue Two precision experiments disagree on how long neutrons live before decaying. Does the discrepancy reflect measurement errors or point to some deeper mystery? Luckily for life on Earth, most matter is not radioactive. We take this fact for granted, but it is actually somewhat surprising because the neutron, one of the two components of atomic nuclei (along with the proton), is prone to radioactive decay. Inside an atomic nucleus, a typical neutron can survive for a very long time and may never decay, but on its own, it will transform into other particles within 15 minutes, more or less. The words "more or less" cover a disturbing gap in physicists' understanding of this particle. Try as we might, we have not been able to accurately measure the neutron lifetime. This is a preview.
