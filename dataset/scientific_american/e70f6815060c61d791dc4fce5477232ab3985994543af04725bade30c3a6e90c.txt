Read Our Latest Issue The latest disagreement over the universe's expansion rate suggests researchers may be on the threshold of revolutionary discoveries A long-running dispute about how fast our universe is expanding just became even more entrenched. New and more precise measurements of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, have only strengthened the differences between two independent methods of calculating the expansion rate. This impasse may soon force cosmologists to reexamine the "standard model" of cosmology, which tells us about the composition of the universe (radiation, normal matter, dark matter and dark energy) and how it has evolved over time. Riess also thinks that the discrepancy is pointing fingers at cosmologists' standard model. "At some point, you have to start saying the universe has another wrinkle in it, in the cosmological model--in the composition of the universe or in some feature of dark matter or dark energy--[that] could also potentially explain this," he says. "You have to give that some serious consideration." Anil Ananthaswamyis author of and, most recently, May 16, 2018  --  Lee Billings February 6, 2019  --  Corey S.
