Read Our Latest Issue The largest experiment ever to probe these mysterious particles could point the way to new physics I'm standing on a catwalk in a giant cave crammed with industrial equipment, and I'm told that trillions of neutrinos are flying through every inch of my body each second. I reach out my arms as if to heighten the sensation, but of course, I can't feel a thing. Nearly massless, traveling close to the speed of light, the ghostly particles traverse the empty space between my atoms without a trace. They also move mostly unimpeded through the hulking metal box that dominates the cavern. But a few times a day one will collide with an atom inside the school bus-size contraption, liberating charged particles that leave light trails visible to scientists. And these trails, physicists hope, will lead them into unknown territory. This is a preview. Make a selection below to access this issue.Already have access? . Having trouble accessing this article?
