Read Our Latest Issue Dark matter is not just a puzzle. It is a solution Although astronomers only slowly came to realize dark matter's importance in the universe, for me personally it happened in an instant. In my first project as a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1978, I measured the rotational velocities of star-forming giant molecular clouds in the outer part of the disk of our Milky Way galaxy. I worked out what was then the most accurate method to determine those velocities, and I sat down to plot out the results (by hand on graph paper) in the astronomy department lounge. Two other experts on the Milky Way, Frank Shu and Ivan King, happened by. They watched as I filled in the velocities of the outermost clouds, and the pattern we saw made it clear at once that the Milky Way was rife with dark matter, especially in its outermost parts. We sat and scratched our heads, imagining what the nature of the dark matter could be, and all the ideas we came up with turned out in short order to be wrong. This is a preview.
