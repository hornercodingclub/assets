Developed by Spectrolab (a company that makes solar cells for spacecraft) with funding from the Department of Energy, the so-called multiple-junction solar cell consists of germanium and several layers of gallium arsenide. Each layer responds to different wavelengths and works with sunlight concentrated by lenses or mirrors, thereby maximizing the conversion efficiency. Percent of conversion efficiency in: Standard silicon cell: Spectrolab cell: Number of layers in Spectrolab cell: Size of cell in square centimeters: Maximum concentrated solar input in watts per square centimeter: Equivalent concentration, number of suns: Electrical output in watts: Estimated cost in cents per kilowatt-hour: This article was originally published with the title "Data Points" in Scientific American  296, 2, 25 (February 2007) doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0207-25d 7 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
