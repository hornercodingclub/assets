Marine biologists had noticed that in this typically social crustacean, sickly looking lobsters, infected with a lethal and contagious virus called PaV1, usually become isolated from the pack. To determine if the avoidance is purposeful, scientists set up two adjacent dens in a tank of seawater, tied either a sick or healthy lobster in one den and then introduced a second lobster. If the second creature was already infected, it bunked with its sick or healthy tank-mate equally often. But healthy lobsters were one fourth as likely to share dens with infected lobsters than with healthy ones--even before the sickies became contagious--probably because of chemical signals. The result marks the first observation of wild social animals avoiding diseased individuals, the researchers write in the May 25 .
