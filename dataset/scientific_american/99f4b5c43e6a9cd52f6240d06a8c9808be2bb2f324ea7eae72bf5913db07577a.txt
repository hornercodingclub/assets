In the new work, scientists tested analgesic drugs on mice unable to produce the GIRK2 protein. Allan I. Basbaum of Rockefeller University and his colleagues found that male mutants had lower pain thresholds than normal male mice. Female mutants exhibited a tolerance comparable to that of their normal counterparts, however, suggesting that GIRK2 is responsible for sex differences in pain sensitivity. Male mutants also did not respond as favorably to two pain medications, clonidine and morphine, as the normal animals did. In the second study, R. Adron Harris of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues tested varying types of palliative drugs on the mutant mice and found that they all activate GIRK2. The drugs still had some effect on the mutant mice, however, so other pain-mediating mechanisms are most likely at work as well.
