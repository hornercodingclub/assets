Read Our Latest Issue A new technology that mimics the way nature gives bright color to butterfly wings can make cell phone displays clearly legible, even in the sun's glare The next time you buy a cell phone, take a close look at the display panel. If things go the way Qualcomm hopes, that colorful little rectangle could give a whole new meaning to the expression "butterfly effect." True, the interferometric modulator (IMOD) displays recently introduced by the San Diego-based firm have nothing to do with the unexpectedly strong effect a wing beat can theoretically have on the weather.
