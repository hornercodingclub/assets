Read Our Latest Issue Quantum computers will render today's cryptographic methods obsolete. What happens then? One bright October afternoon on a beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico, two scientists found the solution to a problem that didn't yet exist. It was 1979. Gilles Brassard, then a newly graduated Ph.D. from Cornell University, was immersed in the warm Caribbean water when someone swam toward him. The dark-haired stranger launched into a pitch about how to make a currency that could not be counterfeited. The scheme, invented several years earlier by a Columbia University graduate student named Stephen Wiesner, involved embedding photons--particles of light--in banknotes. By the laws of quantum mechanics, any attempt to measure or copy the photons would instantaneously change their properties. Each bill would have its own string of photons, a quantum serial number that could never be duplicated. This is a preview. Make a selection below to access this issue.Already have access? .
