Read Our Latest Issue Researchers led by Shuichi Yanagisawa of Okayama University in Japan engineered a strain of plants carrying an additional gene, which affects metabolism. The modified plants contained more carbon, amino acids and about 30 percent more nitrogen than control plants did. In addition, they grew well in soil containing one tenth the amount of nitrogen that normal shrubs needed to flourish. The scientists also tested the modification technique on potato plants and had similar successes. They thus posit that the approach could be applied to a wide variety of plant species and could suggest a means of lessening agricultural dependence on nitrogen fertilizers. 7 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
