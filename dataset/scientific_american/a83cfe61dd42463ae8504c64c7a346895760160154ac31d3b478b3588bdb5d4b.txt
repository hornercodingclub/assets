After more than 75 years of weekly publishing--largely in black and white, with occasional washes of color--the magazine shifted to a rotary offset lithography press for covers in 1917, which allowed for the lush paintings that marked its transition to a monthly in 1921. In 1931 covers scaled back to two colors, likely to save money during the Great Depression. As the economy rebounded, a wider range of tones emerged in 1933 in the form of black-and-white photography. In 1948 the look changed again, this time because of a shift in ownership and editorial vision: color paintings returned, in a square image set on a solid background, which became white in 1952 and remained white for about 43 years. As desktop publishing arose at the end of the 20th century, designs became more experimental: images broke out of the box, ushering in a period of bold--primarily digitally crafted--illustrations.
