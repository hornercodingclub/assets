gaining large amounts energy runaway electrons collide air molecules generate runaway electrons plus x rays gamma rays resulting avalanche high energy particles instead rocks landslide think runaway electrons shrapnel tearing path storm cloud according gurevich model conductive path causes lightning runaway breakdown create large amounts high energy electrons x rays gamma rays interestingly know runaway breakdown works low electric fields seen inside thunderstorms know happen right lightning big bursts x rays gamma rays shooting thunderstorms fact gamma rays energetic bright observed outer space 600 kilometers 373 miles earth surface add cosmic rays cause lightning sure present researchers including voiced skepticism
