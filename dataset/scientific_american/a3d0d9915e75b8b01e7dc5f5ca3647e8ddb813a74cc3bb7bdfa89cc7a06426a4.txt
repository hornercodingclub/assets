Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Although learning a language is harder as an adult than as a child, here are a few strategies that can help pave the way: Pay attention to nonverbal cues, such as eye gaze, gestures or pointing. They can enhance your understanding of sounds, words, phrases and even grammar. Going to bed soon after drilling vocabulary or other practice can help consolidate what you have learned. You can improve your pronunciation by recording yourself in conversation (as opposed to reading from a script) and practicing with a native speaker. Listening to language spoken in the background while doing another task can help you learn to distinguish among similar sounds. Hearing and repeating words and phrases can help you learn them faster and recall them better. Of course, nothing is more effective for learning than complete immersion in the culture. Living and working with native speakers can round out this experience.
