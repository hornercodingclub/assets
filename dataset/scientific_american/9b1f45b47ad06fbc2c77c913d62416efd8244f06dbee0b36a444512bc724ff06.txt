Read Our Latest Issue Sensors have captured more than 40 events On September 14, 2015, lasers in Louisiana and Washington State wavered together in response to a disturbance in spacetime, and a new window opened onto the cosmos.* The two sites are part of the LIGO gravitational-wave detector--sensitive, powerful lasers so carefully isolated from Earth's motion that they can pick up incredibly minuscule vibrations. The signal was a gravitational wave, a ripple in spacetime created by two black holes merging 1.4 billion light-years away, far beyond our Milky Way galaxy. The event--the first detection of gravitational waves--also proved that black holes can orbit each other and merge. Since then, sensors have detected 43 more events, making them seem almost commonplace, says Christopher Berry, a member of the LIGO team. The accumulating data are helping astronomers better understand the menagerie of objects that populate the universe. This is a preview.
