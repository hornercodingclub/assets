Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Fertility procedures have pushed multiple births higher, prompting policy changes Since the 1970s more and more twins have been popping up across the developed world ( ). Women have been having babies at older ages, so more are becoming pregnant at the natural peak age for twins: about 35. And fertility treatments have become more common, which boosts the chances of twins further ( ). Because multiple births are dangerous for both mothers and babies, public health officials would like to reverse the trend.
