Read Our Latest Issue Astronomers using the microlensing technique located their first extrasolar planet just last year. When a massive object such as a star crosses in front of another star located farther away relative to Earth, its gravitational pull bends the light rays and magnifies them. To earthbound observers, this configuration makes the distant star appear brighter, as if a lens was placed in front of it. When the "lens" moves out of the path, the star appears to return to its regular brightness. If a planet is in orbit around the lensing star, scientists can deduce its presence because it affects the process in a predictable way. Observations from around the world, collected by both professional and amateur astronomers alike, were required to collect enough continuous data about this latest microlensing event. The researchers report that the new planet is orbiting its host star at a distance about three times that separating our planet and the sun. Located approximately 15,000 light-years from Earth, it is also one of the farthest known planets outside our solar system. The scientists hope their new find is just the beginning: "We expect many more discoveries in the coming years," Gaudi predicts.
