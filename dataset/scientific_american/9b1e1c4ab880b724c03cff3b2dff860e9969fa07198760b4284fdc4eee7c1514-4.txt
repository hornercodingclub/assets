required launch membrane wings pterosaurs bats produce lift unit speed area feathered wings birds additional lift improves slow speed maneuvering capability small animals helps making tighter turns big animals facilitates takeoff landing important prerequisite launch power efficient large wings big flier needs produce lots leaping power airborne flying animals not flap way air use gravity elevated location cliff wings not produce lift low speeds gravity launching mean trying accelerating wrong direction dangerous prospect instead powerful jump provides critical speed height begin flight increased leaping power yields better launching power large fliers need good jumpers birds manage impressive leaps constrained heritage
