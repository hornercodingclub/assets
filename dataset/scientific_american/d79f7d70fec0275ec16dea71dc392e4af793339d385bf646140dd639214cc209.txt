OkCupid co-founder Rudder drills down into that last category via charts, graphs and intriguing analyses of human behavior gleaned from the wealth of social data now available. He finds, for example, that women with polarizing appearances (appealing to some, off-putting to others) are more likely to get dates than those who are conventionally attractive. Because this information is based not on surveys or artificial experiments but on human actions, "our privileged data exposes attitudes that most people would never cop to in public," Rudder writes.
