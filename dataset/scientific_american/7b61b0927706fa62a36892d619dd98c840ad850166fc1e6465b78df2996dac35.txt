Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue by Camille Seaman Princeton Architectural Press, 2014 (($55)) The steady disappearance of Earth's polar ice is illustrated beautifully, but devastatingly, in this large-format book. Seaman's photographs, shot over a period of roughly a decade, document the architectural wonder of icebergs, many of which are visibly diminishing in response to warming temperatures.

She accompanies her pictures with essays tracing the changes she has witnessed.
