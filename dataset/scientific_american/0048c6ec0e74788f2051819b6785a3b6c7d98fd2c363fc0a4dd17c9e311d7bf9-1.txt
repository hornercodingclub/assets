diameter telescopes essentially big light buckets collect photons given observing time bigger mirrors boost telescope angular resolution ability measure separation close objects generation big telescopes follows leap technology achieved mauna kea hawaii 1990s keck telescopes 10 years saw limitations 10 meter apertures says chuck steidel professor astronomy california institute technology chair science advisory committee tmt started thinking going generation ground based telescope need start thinking race build observatories driven not wanting left steidel says plenty science occupy multiple versions telescopes having shared world shame actually telescope worth things size not telescopes rely adaptive optics technology incorporates deformable shape changing mirror
