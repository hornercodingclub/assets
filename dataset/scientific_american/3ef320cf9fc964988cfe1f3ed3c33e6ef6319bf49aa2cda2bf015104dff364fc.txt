The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard cases on the constitutionality of voting districts that allegedly entrenched a strong advantage for Republicans in Wisconsin and Democrats in Maryland but dodged direct rulings in both.

Part of the problem, as former justice Anthony Kennedy noted in a 2004 case, is that courts high and low have yet to settle on a "workable standard" for identifying a partisan gerrymander in the first place. That is where a growing number of mathematicians around the country think we can help. This is a preview. Make a selection below to access this issue.Already have access? .
