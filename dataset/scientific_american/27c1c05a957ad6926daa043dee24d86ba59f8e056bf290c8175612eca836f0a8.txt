Much of the development that is improving people's lives is also threatening their future by harming India's natural environment. If the nation's progress is to continue, people must find a way to live sustainably, journalist Subramanian says. To illustrate India's challenges and opportunities, she tells five true stories themed around the five elements in Hinduism: earth (organic farming), water (rejuvenating a dried-up river), fire (the quest for smokeless cooking stoves), air (restoring the vulture population) and the abstract ether permeating the space we live in (teaching sexual health to limit population growth).
