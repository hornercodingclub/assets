left not young people big loss today signs money national laboratories universities problems geothermal not known spite fact years ago geothermal producing kilowatt hours wind u.s. everybody knew wind energy people knew geothermal energy plants efficiencies improved close diminishing returns geothermal working lower temperatures material intensive big heat exchangers impact high material costs past years impacted cost power plant not point view drastically reducing turbines extremely efficient second law thermodynamics allows getting pretty close limit big changes occur improving exploration techniques time reduced probability find right spot drilling improved today wells dry wells low production wells means better exploration accuracy
