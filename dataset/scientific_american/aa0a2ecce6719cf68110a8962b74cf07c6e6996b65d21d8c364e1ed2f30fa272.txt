Twenty-one infants from nine families had passed away before the age of one and the scientists analyzed DNA from four of the babies as well as their parents, siblings and close relatives. The researchers identified an alteration in a gene on chromosome 6 called : all four children had two abnormal copies of the gene, and their parents each carried one copy of the alteration. is expressed in the brain stem, and sudden deaths may occur because of changes to the brain's regulatory systems that govern cardiac and pulmonary protective reflexes, the team reports. The researchers will next investigate the relationship between mutations and SIDS in the general population, as well as the gene's role in controlling breathing and heart rate in premature infants that are otherwise normal. 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
