The extra liquid and the pipette itself, however, can destroy it: only half of cells that undergo this procedure survive. In place of a pipette, scientists at Brigham Young University have developed a silicon lance. They apply a positive charge to the lance so that the negative-charged DNA sticks. When the device enters a cell, the charge is reversed and the DNA is set free. In the study, 72 percent of nearly 3,000 mouse egg cells survived.
