Although the national average increased from 73.8 to 79.1 years from 1980 to 2014, the gap between counties with the highest and lowest rates grew to a startling 20 years ( ). Equally surprising is that the disparity is driven not so much by income or race--long thought to be the greatest factors--but by behaviors such as inactivity and metabolic conditions such as diabetes ( ).
