Read Our Latest Issue A number of features of the solar cell already hint at feasible improvements. If the nanorods--which are a jumbled mess in the prototype--can be packed closer together and oriented perpendicular to the electrodes, electron transfer to the electrodes would be more efficient. Also, altering the diameter of the rods while the length remains constant changes their absorption spectrum, which means that they can be tuned to absorb different colors that span the spectrum of sunlight. If researchers can improve their efficiency by a factor of 10, the new cells could challenge existing, yet expensive, high-efficiency silicon-based devices. For one thing, they are much easier to manufacture because they don't require sophisticated processing. They could also be applied to a wider variety of surfaces. According to co-author Janke J. Dittmer, "the beauty of this is that you could put solar cells directly on plastic, which has unlimited flexibility." April 30, 2001  --  Naomi Lubick Discover world-changing science.
