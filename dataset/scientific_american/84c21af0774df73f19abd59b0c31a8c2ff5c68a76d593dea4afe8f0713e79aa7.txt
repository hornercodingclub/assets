The uses data from the Kepler satellite mission, which (until technical issues sidelined it earlier this year) had been focusing on a single spot in the sky in the hope of catching so-called "transits"--instances when an exoplanet would pass in front of its host star, blocking some of the light. If any moons orbited those planets, they could also be visible in the data. This animation by , a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, shows what a theoretical exomoon would look like.
