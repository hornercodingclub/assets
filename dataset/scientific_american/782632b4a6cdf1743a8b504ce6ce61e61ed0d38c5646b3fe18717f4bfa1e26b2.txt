Read Our Latest Issue Dozens of particles from halfway across the universe have landed in the IceCube experiment at the South Pole. These messengers could help answer some long-standing cosmic conundrums One of the most ambitious and extreme experiments on Earth opened at the South Pole in 2010. IceCube, a giant particle detector buried in the polar ice, captures elusive, high-energy species of neutrinos--fundamental particles that fly straight through almost everything they touch. The project, for which I am the principal investigator, aims to use neutrinos to study distant cosmic phenomena--particularly the mysterious, violent processes thought to produce the charged particles known as cosmic rays that continually bombard Earth.
