Read Our Latest Issue Scientists are on the threshold of crossing a sharp ethical line: permanently altering the human genetic code Kyle Orwig has been itching to do an experiment that would, in his words, "piss people off." Orwig, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, is an expert on the intricate biology of sperm cells--in particular, how specialized "stem" cells located in the male testes produce sperm. Every so often, however, a genetic flaw prevents these stem cells from completing this process, thus rendering the male infertile. The experiment Orwig has in mind is to use gene-editing technology to fix this flaw in the sperm-forming stem cells and then transplant them back into infertile mice, thereby demonstrating a potential treatment for male infertility.
