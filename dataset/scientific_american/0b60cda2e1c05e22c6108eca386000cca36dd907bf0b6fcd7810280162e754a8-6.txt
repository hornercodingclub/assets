measure energy electron superposition find energy ground state energy excited state equal probability case encounter randomness naysayers assert readily sidestep apparent roadblock create radically new functionality instead measuring electron superposition leave instance start electron state 0 send p/2 pulse send second p/2 pulse measure electron state 1 100 percent probability observable sharp significance consider basic logic gate computer output negation input 0 goes 1 1 0 suppose given following assignment design square root logic gate acting twice succession input negates classical equipment find assignment impossible p/2 pulse implements impossible logic gate pulses succession exactly desired effect consecutive applications square root
