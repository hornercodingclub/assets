Read Our Latest Issue Christopher M. Reddy of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and his colleagues studied a sediment core collected from marshland in Buzzards Bay near West Falmouth, Mass. In 1969, the barge ran aground there and released 700,000 liters of oil into the environment. The team found that the top and bottom sections of the core were clear of petroleum residue. The section between six and 28 centimeters, however, contained levels of petroleum chemicals in concentrations similar to those detected immediately after the accident. "The long-term biological effects of oil contamination at this site is unknown since animals burrowing into these sediments can be exposed to high levels of some of these compounds," Reddy says. "It is clear from this study that oil spills can have a long-term impact on a coastal environment." Discover world-changing science.
