brain spheroids useful custom modifications recent illustrates point brain spheroids study important cell type brain called oligodendrocytes rare disease associated dysfunction oligodendrocytes form fatty sheath called myelin insulate axons long protrusions neurons use communicate neurons think rubber insulation copper wire electrical messages traveling axons need myelin maintain electrical charge transmit message quickly adding steps standard brain spheroid method authors spheroids contain neurons oligodendrocytes ensheath neurons axons like brain oligocortical spheroids dubbed closely resemble real developing brain importantly authors showed oligocortical spheroids study disorders impair oligodendrocyte development myelination authors treated oligocortical spheroids fda approved pro myelination drugs saw accelerated oligodendrocyte development
