striking excites electrons higher energy state drop ground state emit light generally fluorescence not noticeable wavelength emitted light infrared spectrum light feeble sun solar cell designs reuse light boost efficiency electrons excited break free atoms surround electrons serve basis electric current electrons not stay free long trillionths second drop ground state serving useful purpose reason solar cells not operate 100 percent efficiency polymer chisholm team developed phosphoresces like glow dark toys electrons hold energy longer phosphorescence fluorescence stay free longer scale microseconds based calculations team expected material fluoresce saw phosphorescence tested doping makes difference tungsten molybdenum metal atoms electrons available
