People still often think of children as defective adults. But in the past three decades scientists have discovered that even the youngest children know more than we would ever have thought possible. Moreover, studies suggest that children learn about the world in much the same way that scientists do--by conducting experiments, analyzing statistics, and forming intuitive theories of the physical, biological and psychological realms.
