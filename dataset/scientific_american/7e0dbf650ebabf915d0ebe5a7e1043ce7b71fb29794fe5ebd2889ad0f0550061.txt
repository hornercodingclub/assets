Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Ever green: Pine trees, which can grow for thousands of years, are the oldest living trees. But scientists are learning that palms can be even older--at least at the cellular level. A recent paper explains that conventional trees experience a secondary growth phase--replacing functional tissues with younger cells--but palm trees do not. The individual cells in a palm, seen in this micrograph of the genus , endure throughout the tree's life span, which can range from 100 to 740 years. This 1.5-millimeter-wide cross section of a vascular bundle ( ) is responsible for transporting water, minerals and nutrients through the trunk. Thousands of these bundles are found in every level of the palm and continuously work to sustain its growth.
