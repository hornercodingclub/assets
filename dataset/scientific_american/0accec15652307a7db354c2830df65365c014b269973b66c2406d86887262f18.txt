Read Our Latest Issue Biologist Anna-Louise Reysenbach of Portland State University and her colleagues collected samples from several vent sites off the Pacific coast of South America and isolated a microorganism that seemed to persist near areas of elemental sulfur deposits. Back in the lab, the microbe flourished when allowed to propagate in a sulfur-rich, acidic environment. Further experiments showed that the Archaea-domain critters could prosper in pHs ranging from 3.3 to 5.8 and temperatures between 77 and 50 degrees C. The tiny cellular organism sports a single flagellum to propel it and an outer coating that "resembles a delicate bridal veil," the researchers write. Reysenbach and her team dubbed the microbe based on its preference for environments that are a little sour and deep as well as for David Boone, a pioneer in the study of Archaea, who recently passed away. The existence of this acid-loving, warm water extremophile confirms yet another niche in which life can prosper, including extremes of temperature and chemical composition. It also raises the prospect that early life on the earth--or elsewhere in the universe--may have been closer to than bacteria. The paper presenting the finding appears in today's David Biello is a contributing editor at .
