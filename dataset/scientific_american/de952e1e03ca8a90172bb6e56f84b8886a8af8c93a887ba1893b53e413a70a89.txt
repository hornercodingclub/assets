By reducing only nitrogen oxide emissions, and leaving carbon monoxide emissionswhich usually accompany themat normal levels, global warming is actually worsened. Using a tropospheric Chemical Transport Model (CTM), developed at the University of California at Irvine, researchers from UC-Irvine and the Frontier Research System for Global Change in Yokohama, Japan, calculated the short-term regional effects of the emissions. They then combined them with their findings on long-term global trends of greenhouse gases to determine their combined impact on climate change. The findings reinforce the theory that urban pollutants, as indirect greenhouse gases, play an important role in global warming.
