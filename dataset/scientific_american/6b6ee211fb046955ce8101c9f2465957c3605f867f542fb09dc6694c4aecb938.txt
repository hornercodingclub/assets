Another study at least shows that mishaps caused by pilot error among U.S. carriers declined between 1983 and 2002. The analysis, by Susan P. Baker of Johns Hopkins University and her colleagues, traced the gains to improved training and crew communication as well as to advanced technology that provides more accurate data on such variables as aircraft position and rough weather. The overall mishap rate has remained steady, however, perhaps because of increased mistakes by ground personnel and air-traffic controllers, who must handle many more flights than in the past.
