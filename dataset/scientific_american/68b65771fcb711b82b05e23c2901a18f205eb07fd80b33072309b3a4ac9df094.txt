Read Our Latest Issue William E. Williams, a professor of biology at St. Marys College of Maryland, and his colleagues studied patches of snow containing in the Snowy Range of the Rocky Mountains. The scientists assembled a shallow Plexiglass chamber containing sensors for tracking photosynthesis and took measurements in early July three years in a row ( ). They found that the bacteria absorbed carbon dioxide from both the soil and the air when exposed to the ambient light of their surroundings. By filtering the natural light, the team also determined that absorbs the greenhouse gas more efficiently in red light than in white, blue or green light because of its own coloring. The organisms react to varying light levels in a manner similar to that of the leaves of higher plants. Although the findings are preliminary, they suggest that photosynthesis in a square meter of snow could soak up five grams of carbon each year, and that "summer snowfields can be surprisingly productive."
