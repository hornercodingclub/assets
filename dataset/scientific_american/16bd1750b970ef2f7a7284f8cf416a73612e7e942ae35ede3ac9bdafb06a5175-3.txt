form matter hypothesized never created scientists nobel laureates managed 1995 hau intended use light probe properties new species decided use condensate play light instead 1999 famous finding hau shone laser light condensate causing photons creep inside tricky experiment borderline possible says happens condensate contains sodium atoms held place magnetic field illuminated coupling laser serves condensate transparent specific frequency light photons frequency emitted short pulse probe laser hit condensate trigger quantum dark state means sodium atoms enter superposition energy states simultaneously photons encounter atoms entangled edge light pulse slows edge catches compressing light like concertina 100 micron thick condensate light slowed
