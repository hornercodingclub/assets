Abrams, 2014 Massive beaver dams, woven wasp nests and lofty termite towers are among the impressive constructions documented in this large visual book. Photographer Arndt traveled the world to capture animal architecture that is functional, beautiful and complex. Some creations, such as sculptures that carrier snails make of shells and pebbles held together with the snails' own bonding secretions, would not seem amiss in the world's best art museums. Text from biologist Tautz complements Arndt's photographs to explain these wonders of animal industry.
