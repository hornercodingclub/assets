Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Earth got a close shave from an asteroid similar in size to the one that produced the 1908 Tunguska explosion in Siberia. The object, dubbed 2009 DD45, zipped past on March 2 at about twice the distance of geostationary orbit and only days after its discovery. Its orbit intersects Earth's, but the rock will not get anywhere near this close for another 58 years.
