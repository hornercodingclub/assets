Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in June 1904 "The flying machine invented by Orville and Wilbur Wright, which made a successful flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C., last December, had another trial near Dayton, Ohio, on May 26, which the brothers say was successful. Great secrecy was maintained about the test, and but few witnessed it. The machine, after being propelled along a track for the distance of a hundred feet, rose in the air and flew a short distance, then it dropped. This was due, the inventors say, to a derangement of the gasoline engine that furnishes the power. The propellers were broken in the fall, and the test could not be repeated." -- , June 1904 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our shiny . 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
