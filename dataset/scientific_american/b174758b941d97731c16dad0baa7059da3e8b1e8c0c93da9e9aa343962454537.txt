The virus first surfaced in this country back in 2007, when an American medical volunteer contracted the disease during an outbreak in Micronesia and then became sick with it back in Alaska. Since then, more than 50 cases have been identified in the U.S. Almost every one of these patients contracted Zika while abroad, but at least two infections were acquired via sexual contact. Because the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not provide detailed state-by-state breakdowns of Zika cases, gathered and analyzed information from the health departments of all 50 states and the District of Columbia and followed up with some county and city health officials. The result is this exclusive map of how the virus first made its way to the U.S. This article was originally published with the title "Travels with Zika" in Scientific American  314, 4, 84 (April 2016) doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0416-84 For more on Zika in the U.S., go to Dina Fine Maron, formerly an associate editor at , is now a wildlife trade investigative reporter at .
