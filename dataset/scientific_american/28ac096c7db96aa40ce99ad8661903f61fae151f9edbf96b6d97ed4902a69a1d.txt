Three nearly complete specimens of a flattened, alligatorlike fish species dubbed possess the scales, fins, snout and lower jaw of a fish, but they have the ribs, neck, skull, wrists and fingerlike bones of a land animal. Scientists had to dig the up to three-meter-long fossils out from icy rock in polar bear country, but they say the tundra resembled a subtropical version of today's Mississippi River delta when the fish was alive some 375 million years ago.
