Read Our Latest Issue "Looking at how the whip behaves gives a clue to this phenomenon (and it helps if
you have actually tried to crack a whip). The whip has to be moved so that a
U-shaped loop is formed near the handle, where the whip is thickest and stiffest.
As the whip is swung, the loop travels outward toward the thinner, lighter tip.
The loop travels progressively faster the closer it gets to the tip, because the
energy from the heavier part of the whip is carried along into the lighter,
thinner part. This amplification is analogous to way in which an ocean wave of
small height becomes a high breaker as it enters the shallow water near the shore
or over a reef. "When the loop reaches the end, it is going extremely fast and causes the very
tip to 'whip' around in a tight circle. It is at this point that the tip exceeds
the speed necessary to create a tiny shock wave in the air; it is this shock that
we hear as the 'crack.' 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
