Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in May 1967 "By the year 2030 the electric power requirement will be 10 times the present capacity. Because of the expected decline in fossil-fuel resources, and in the absence of any other large source of energy at reasonable cost, fission power would be counted on to supply about 85 percent of this need. To fill such a demand with fission plants of the present type, however, would call for quantities of uranium ore that would soon deplete reserves. Thus, the fission age would be over almost before it began. These facts make plain how heavily the 'fission age' (perhaps to be followed someday by a 'fusion age') can depend on success in developing power plants with breeder reactors that will make the most of the available resources." -- , May 1967 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our 5 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
