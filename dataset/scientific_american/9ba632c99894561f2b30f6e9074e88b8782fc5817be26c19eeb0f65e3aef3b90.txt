Read Our Latest Issue Rock-paper-scissors makes for a convenient model, but until now, its predictions had not been tested. Barry Sinervo of the University of California, Santa Cruz and Kelly Zamudio of the University of California, Berkeley report in today's issue of the that they have accomplished just that. They collected DNA samples from 96 females, 131 putative sires and 458 offspring among a population of lizards living in California during the 1992 breeding season, and ran several different rounds of paternity testing. As expected, they found no significant difference in the total numbers of offspring produced by each male type.
"During the 1992 breeding season, each morph successfully used a different tactic to exploit weaknesses of another strategy and a morph's success depended on the close proximity of a vulnerable alternative strategy," the authors write. "Frequency-dependent selection arising from local competition can promote conditions that favor each morph, and thus preserve all three strategies of the rock-paper-scissors cycle in the long term." 7 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
