Read Our Latest Issue Biologist Debashish Bhattacharya of the University of Iowa and his colleagues chose to study because it is the only known organism that does not share the same plastid as all extant algae, plants and other photosynthetic organisms. Its plastid retains a distinct cell wall but divides at the same time as the host and cannot be grown independently. Bhattacharya's team generated a DNA library for the overall organism, isolating the genetic information of this unique plastid. The research revealed that the plastid shared many of the same genes as its free-roaming relatives: -type cyanobacteria. In fact, it still contained thousands of genes--such as photosynthesis-related and nitrogen fixing --that have either been incorporated into the nuclei of regular plant cells or lost entirely. All this points to a relatively recent symbiosis between and its photosynthetic plastid. The amoebas close relative-- --still feeds on cyanobacteria but has yet to incorporate them. By studying the odd amoeba and its new plastid, scientists can gain a window into the mystery of how photosynthesis evolved. The paper presenting the research was published today in David Biello is a contributing editor at .
