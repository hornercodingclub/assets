Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in August 1894 "The citizens of Buffalo, N.Y., were treated to a remarkable mirage between 10 and 11 o'clock on the morning of August 16. It was the city of Toronto, with its harbor and small island to the south of the city. Toronto is fifty-six miles from Buffalo, but the church spires could be counted with the greatest ease. This mirage is what is known as a mirage of the third order. That is, the object looms up far above the real level and not inverted, as is the case with mirages of the first and second class, but appearing like a perfect landscape far away in the sky." -- , August 1894 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our . 7 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
