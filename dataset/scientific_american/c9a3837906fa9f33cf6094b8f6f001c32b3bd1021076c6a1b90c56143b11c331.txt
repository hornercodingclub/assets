Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue  I enjoyed "Black Hole Computers," by Seth Lloyd and Y. Jack Ng, but have two questions: When the radius of the space being measured in the sidebar "Computing Spacetime" doubles, wouldn't the maximum number of satellites allowed in it increase eightfold rather than double, allowing the same spacing of satellites without exceeding the critical density? Also, what would be the effect of relativistic time dilation on a particle (and its encoded information) from the perspective of a frame of reference outside a black hole? Would relativistic time dilation cause the particle and its information to appear to "freeze" on the surface of the event horizon from the perspective of an outside observer, thereby conserving the amount of information available to the universe outside the black hole?
