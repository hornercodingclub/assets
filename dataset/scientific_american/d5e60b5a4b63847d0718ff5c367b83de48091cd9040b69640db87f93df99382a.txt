Sherr, a longtime journalist who covered the space shuttle program for , was also a close friend of Ride's. Sherr admits, however, that parts of the astronaut's history--including her long-term relationship with O'Shaughnessy--came as a surprise after Ride's death because Ride was fiercely private, keeping even friends "from knowing her completely." Sherr tells of an astronaut who was "at heart, a scientist" and who devoted her post-NASA years to inspiring children, especially girls, to pursue science.
