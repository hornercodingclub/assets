Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Information bits from the news As Earth orbits the sun, it exerts a gravitational pull that makes the sun "wobble" to and fro at a rate of up to nine centimeters per second. This so-called radial velocity variation is what astronomers often measure to find exoplanets. Yet their instruments are only sensitive enough to turn up large exoplanets--some of them many times more massive than Jupiter--that can exert a tug of more than one meter per second. A group of researchers at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics has developed a calibration technique using a device called a laser-frequency comb to make radial velocity searches more sensitive. It will make it easier to find smaller, potentially Earth-like planets that may be hospitable to life.
