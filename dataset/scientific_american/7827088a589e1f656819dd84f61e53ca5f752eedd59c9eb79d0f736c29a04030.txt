The organization says the steady decline could be the result of the falling U.S. birthrate or growing preference for text messages over phone calls. It might also suggest that more Americans are instead searching the Internet for health advice--even in emergencies. Staffers still field about three million calls a year, picking up the phone every 14 seconds on average. In 2013, 1,218 people with cases logged at poison-control centers died from direct exposure to a poison or drug. The five substances that generated the most calls in 2013 were: PAIN RELIEVERS COSMETICS/ PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS SEDATIVES/HYPNOTICS/ ANTIPSYCHOTICS ANTIDEPRESSANTS This article was originally published with the title "Poison Control" in Scientific American  312, 3, 12 (March 2015) doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0315-12a 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
