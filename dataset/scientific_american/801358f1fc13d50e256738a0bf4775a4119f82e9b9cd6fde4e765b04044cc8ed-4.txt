realistic weighted voting model discussed book plenty empirical evidence weighted voting model approximates neurons know model not perfect fail badly neurons markram correct real neurons complexities not captured simple models single neuron entire world like cell highly complex assembly molecules machine built molecular parts molecules turn minuscule machine atoms mentioned earlier ion channels important class molecule responsible electrical signals neurons axons dendrites synapses contain different types ion channels differing numbers parts neurons distinct electrical properties principle neuron unique behavior owing unique configuration ion channels far cry weighted voting model according neurons essentially sounds like bad news brain simulation neurons infinitely
