Read Our Latest Issue To avert a future famine, scientists are manipulating the complex conversation that plants have with microbes, pests and other elements of the phytobiome Mercedes Diaz tramps into a muddy soybean field and runs her brightly manicured fingers through the limbs of dozens of knee-high plants. As she checks the stems, pods and leaves, she rattles off a list of possible maladies under her breath: pod borers, frogeye leaf spot, white mold. Diaz spots a tangle of mottled leaves and shouts, "SDS!"--signaling sudden death syndrome. She plucks one of the leaves and hands it to me. I turn the crinkly, palm-sized leaf over in my hand. Irregular holes riddle its surface, along with ugly brown spots tinged in yellow--the effects of a toxin produced by the SDS fungus that courses through the plant, robbing it of its pods and chewing up the leaves from the inside out.
