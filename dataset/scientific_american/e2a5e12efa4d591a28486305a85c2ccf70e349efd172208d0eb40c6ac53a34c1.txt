As an embryo develops in the womb, a changing mix of chemical factors prompts stem cells to morph into different kinds of neurons at specific times. A group led by Su-Chun Zhang at the University of Wisconsin-Madison hit on the combination of retinoic acid and a signaling molecule called sonic hedgehog to mimic the time when stem cells become spinal motor neurons, allowing them to grow the cells at will. The results, published in the February , should enable scientists to look for drugs and develop treatments to counteract spinal cord disease. The late actor Christopher Reeve had lobbied for stem cell research for precisely this purpose.
