Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Despite a huge amount of funding and research, regional and individual differences in cancer trends make it a hard disease to wipe out The number of people who die from cancer varies greatly around the world, often because of differences in behaviour and healthcare.   A dramatic change happens around the age of 20, when the main cancers being diagnosed in the United States start to shift from mainly leukaemia to predominantly digestive, prostate, lung and breast.   In 2013, the US National Institutes of Health spent US$2.6 billion on cancer research, and more than one-quarter of that went to breast cancer.   With the exception of sub-Saharan Africa, lung cancer is one of the top three cancer killers in all regions. Breast, colorectal and prostate also feature prominently.   Gaps between diagnoses and mortality are most prominent for breast and prostate cancer.   Among other factors, public-health measures have influenced the number of US people being diagnosed with certain cancers.   Some cancers have much better prognoses than others. Breast and prostate cancer have benefited from improved treatments and early detection.
