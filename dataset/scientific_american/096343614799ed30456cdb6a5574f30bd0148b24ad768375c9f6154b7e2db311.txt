His meditation on the meanderings of Galileo, who is accompanied at times by scientists resembling Francis Crick, Alan Turing and Charles Darwin, serves as a vehicle for explaining his own theory that consciousness can be quantified. The brain, Tononi postulates, consists of billions of neurons: think of them as transistorlike elements that represent bits with a particular value. When tallied, they add up to more than the sum of their parts. That increment above and beyond--Tononi calls it "phi"--represents the degree to which any being, whether human or mule, remains conscious.
