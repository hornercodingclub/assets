Read Our Latest Issue Horava gravity could explain missing spatial dimensions in a computer simulation   The main story " ," describes recent excitement over a quantum theory of gravity proposed by physicist Petr Hoava of the University of California, Berkeley. Testing theories of quantum gravity in the laboratory is not possible, but computer simulations may offer the next best thing--and they seem to be lending support to Hoava gravity. Jan Ambjorn of the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues have been using computer simulations to model quantum gravity based on that fall into place naturally. So far, they have succeeded in creating a stable four-dimensional spacetime, when viewed at large distances. But when they zoomed in to small distances, they found a strange result--their universe seems to drop two dimensions. So where did the missing dimensions go? Hoava believes that this dimension drop marks the point at which general relativity emerges in his theory of gravity. In his model, the shackles that force time and space to stretch in unison are removed at high energies and short distances. In in April, he explains that within this regime, space stretches only a third as quickly as time. "The three spatial dimensions effectively mimic just one normal relativistic dimension," he says, making it look as though two dimensions have vanished.
