Some of the fused eggs grew to form blastocysts, an early stage of development from which the researchers harvested stem cells. The small study also highlights in a novel way how the quality of eggs declines with age. Number of egg donors: Younger than age 30: Older than age 30: Percent of eggs fused with DNA that developed into blastocysts from donors: Under 30: Over 30: Percent of blastocysts that yielded stem cells from donors: Under 30: Over 30: Percent of stem cell lines established from oocytes from donors: Under 30: Over 30: Science, This article was originally published with the title "Data Points: Egging On" in Scientific American  293, 3, 34 (September 2005) doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0905-34a 7 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
