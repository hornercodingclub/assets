But it also takes something away, argues journalist Harris. "The loss of lack, the end of absence"--a deficit of silence and solitude--is the price we pay for our plugged-in lives, he writes. His book invites readers, especially those old enough to remember life before the Web, to hold on to downtime, daydreams and stillness. "For those of us who have lived both with and without the vast, crowded connectivity the Internet provides," Harris says, "these are the few days when we can still notice the difference between Before and After."
