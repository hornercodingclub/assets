In 1955 Fleming had given the fungus to a neighbor to thank him for foiling a robbery at the famed microbiologist's home. Fleming stumbled on the antibiotic properties of mold in 1928, and over the course of the following decade University of Oxford bacteriologists and others expanded on his findings to develop the first antibiotic drug. Mass production of penicillin during World War II cured millions of people of bacterial infections that would have been fatal otherwise. Today antibiotics are considered one of the greatest discoveries in medical history--thus the auction of a crusty petri dish that would have been thrown out long ago. In a letter accompanying the sample, the microbiologist's housekeeper warned its recipient that the contents were "not to be confused with Gorgonzola cheese!!!" Cost per 100,000 units of penicillin in 1943. With mass production, that price fell to less than 10 cents by 1949. Units of the antibiotic produced by U.S. companies in 1945. Percentage of deaths attributed to bacterial pneumonia in World War II, down from 18 percent in World War I. Classes of antibiotics introduced since penicillin became available. Price paid by the highest bidder for Fleming's original culture.
