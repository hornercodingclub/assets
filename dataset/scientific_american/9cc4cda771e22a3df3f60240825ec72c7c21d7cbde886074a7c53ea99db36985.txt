Although the Arctic ice cap's shrinkage is often expressed in terms of area, the change in volume is just as striking. Between 1980 and 2016 the amount of summer ice in cubic kilometers has decreased by an estimated 72 percent. The numbers for 2016 only buttressed the trend: ice hit record lows for the months of October and November.
