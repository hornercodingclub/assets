Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue Why putting on a friendly face might make you more memorable without a smile," sang Little Orphan Annie in the Broadway musical. It turns out Annie may have been giving some shrewd advice--studies have repeatedly shown that people remember smiling faces better than neutral ones. Now researchers at Duke University have found a physical explanation for the phenomenon. Roberto Cabeza and his colleagues "introduced" volunteers to a number of people by showing them a picture and telling them a name. Using MRI, the investigators found that both learning and recalling the names associated with smiling faces preferentially activated the orbitofrontal cortex, an area of the brain involved in reward processing. Cabeza says that although the studies are preliminary, it makes evolutionary sense that a smile would be rewarding to the onlooker. "We are sensitive to positive social signals," Cabeza explains. "We want to remember people who were kind to us, in case we interact with them in the future."
