It may not be debilitating, but it's sometimes enough to distract you from your tasks and drive you bonkers. Eileen tells me that she's had intermittent and multiple bouts of seemingly non-stop eye twitching in her eyelid almost daily for one month, with each episode a few minutes long. It's enough to interfere with her work. She gets through the day but gets distracted by the twitching.
