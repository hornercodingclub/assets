chimp versus human alternatively small changes structures proteins 1 percent divergence produce changes interact cellular components subtly alter pathways involved point not know types changes responsible relatively big differences chimps humans worth noting individual humans generally differ 0.1 percent genetically chimps differ humans 15 fold average humans 0.1 percent human divergence certainly results significant variation physical appearance traits different humans therefor not surprised chimps 98.5 percent related humans relatively small genetic changes produce major phenotypic changes 4 hours ago robin lloyd | 7 hours ago tanya lewis josh fischman jeffery delviscio sunya bhutta 8 hours ago eli m. cahan |
