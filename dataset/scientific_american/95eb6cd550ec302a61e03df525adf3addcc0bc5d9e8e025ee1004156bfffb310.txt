An image taken by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft in 2005 shows a downhill track on the wall of a crater that was not present in the previous image of the crater, taken less than four years earlier. In subsequent views of the deposit, the sun's light is coming in at different angles, but the light-colored material remains, suggesting it is not a trick of the light or the result of dry erosion.
