Astronomers are now solving the mystery of its return About 13.8 billion years ago, just 400,000 years or so after the big bang, the universe abruptly went dark. Before that time, the entire visible universe was a hot, seething, roiling plasma--a dense cloud of protons, neutrons and electrons. If anyone had been there to see it, the universe would have looked like a pea soup fog, but blindingly bright. Around the 400,000-year mark, however, the expanding universe cooled enough for hydrogen atoms to form at last--an event known as recombination. The fog lifted, the universe continued to cool and everything quickly faded to black. After the unimaginable brilliance of the big bang and its immediate aftermath, the cosmos entered what astronomers call the dark ages of the universe. This is a preview.
