atoms pu created u captures neutron forms u undergoes beta decays happens better fissioning u pu formed reactor fissions reactor operates fact nuclear reactor derive significant energy plutonium fission plutonium fissions reduces left fuel maximize plutonium production reactor create plutonium possible minimizing splits breeder reactors fast reactors fast neutrons ideal plutonium production easily absorbed u create pu cause fission thermal neutrons fast breeder reactors generate 30 percent fuel use creating extra fuel nuclear reactors not concerns plutonium produced removed nuclear weapons extract plutonium fuel reprocessed creating radioactive waste potentially high radiation exposures reasons u.s. president carter halted spent fuel reprocessing
