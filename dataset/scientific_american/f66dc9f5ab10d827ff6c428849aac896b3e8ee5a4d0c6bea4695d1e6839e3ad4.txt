Read Our Latest Issue A look at military science from the first year of the war that engulfed Europe On August 4, German troops invaded Belgium, Britain had declared war on Germany and the fighting had started in earnest. There was a widespread feeling that the war would be short and decisive, despite the size of the armies involved. New weapons, it was thought, might provide a quick way to overcome any perceived advantage an enemy might have. Casualties in this modern war would not be excessive. By the end of the year, however, it was clear that not only would massive numbers of men need to fight but casualties would be immense.
