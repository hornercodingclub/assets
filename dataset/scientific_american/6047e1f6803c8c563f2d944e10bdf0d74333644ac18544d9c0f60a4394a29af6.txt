Countries such as Cuba, the U.S. and European nations have sent hundreds of personnel. Beijing has already sent a total of 252 people to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three hardest-hit countries, and donated about $123 million to 13 African countries and international organizations to combat Ebola, Xinhua reported. "In the months to come, more than 1,000 medical workers and public health experts will be sent by China to assist in the battle against Ebola in West African countries," Xinhua reported, citing a government document by the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said last Friday Beijing will send an elite unit of the People's Liberation Army to help Liberia, the country worst-hit by the outbreak that has killed 4,951 people out of 13,567 infected in eight countries.
