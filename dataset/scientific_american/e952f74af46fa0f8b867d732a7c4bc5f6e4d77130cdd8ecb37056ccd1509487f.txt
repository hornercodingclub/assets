Read Our Latest Issue Peptide nucleic acid, a synthetic hybrid of protein and DNA, could form the basis of a new class of drugs--and of artificial life unlike anything found in nature For all the magnificent diversity of life on this planet, ranging from tiny bacteria to majestic blue whales, from sunshine-harvesting plants to mineral-digesting endoliths miles underground, only one kind of "life as we know it" exists. All these organisms are based on nucleic acids--DNA and RNA--and proteins, working together more or less as described by the so-called central dogma of molecular biology: DNA stores information that is transcribed into RNA, which then serves as a template for producing a protein. The proteins, in turn, serve as important structural elements in tissues and, as enzymes, are the cell's workhorses. This is a preview.
