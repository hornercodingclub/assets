Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue On May 29 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory dedicated the National Ignition Facility, the world's biggest laser system. It will direct laser beams from all directions onto a pencil-eraser-size pellet of frozen hydrogen (housed in a tube called a hohlraum), heating it to millions of degrees and inducing fusion. The laser beams must travel some distance to pick up energy from amplifiers and hit its tiny target; the lab likens the accuracy to a pitcher at AT&T Park in San Francisco throwing a strike at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Designed to ensure that U.S. nuclear warheads work properly in lieu of actual testing, the facility will also provide a means to study the interior of stars and fusion as an energy source.
