Marks and James Sterngold PublicAffairs, 2014 ($26.99) The past 50 years have seen remarkable strides in cancer research and treatment, thanks in part to physician and researcher Marks. Since the 1950s Marks has contributed to the genetic research that has gradually provided a basic understanding of cancer cells. He also pushed to change public perception of the disease, petitioning President Richard M. Nixon to declare a war on cancer. With his co-author, business reporter Sterngold, Marks recounts his life and work, giving readers insight into cancer treatment's past and glimpses of its future.
