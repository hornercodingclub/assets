build black box algorithms frustrates rudin problem comes fact medical algorithms built adapting deep learning tools developed types image analysis reason not build robot explain insists exponentially harder build transparent algorithm scratch repurpose existing black box algorithm look medical data rudin suspects researchers let algorithm run try understand later came conclusion rudin developing transparent ai algorithms analyze mammograms suspected tumors constantly inform researchers research stymied lack available images train algorithm images publicly available tend poorly labeled taken old machines no longer use rudin says enormous diverse data sets algorithms tend pick confounding factors black boxes ai algorithm ability learn experience
