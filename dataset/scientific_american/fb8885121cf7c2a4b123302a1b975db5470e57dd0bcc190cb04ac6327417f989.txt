Read Our Latest Issue Despite the hype, when science meets commerce, objectivity is often the loser I'm tapping away at my laptop as colored shapes appear onscreen. I'm supposed to hit the right arrow key--and fast--if the new shape matches the previous one and the left arrow key if it doesn't. Next, in a test of attention, I'm throwing switches on virtual tracks to direct colored trains into appropriately colored stations. It's a little trickier but not much more interesting; I get bored, and my mind wanders. Suddenly, I have two trains about to roll into the wrong stations, with more emerging all the time. It does not end well. I am determined to redeem myself, and I start the next game with clenched teeth. Grids of squares appear, some of which briefly change their shade, and I have to remember their positions. The grids get larger and harder to take in as I play, but I rack up a big score anyway. Final verdict: I'm in the 92nd percentile for memory, the 80th percentile for speed--and the 13th for attention. I suppose the problem lack of attention, but it didn't help that I am color-blind.
