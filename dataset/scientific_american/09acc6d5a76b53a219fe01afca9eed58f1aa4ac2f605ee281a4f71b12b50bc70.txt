Read Our Latest Issue A new experimental approach at the interface of chemistry and biology lets scientists peer into the deepest reaches of the body's master controller Our nervous system is like a tapestry of sorts, woven with interconnecting threads. These threads, the thin fibers known as axons that extend out from neurons, carry electrical information from individual nerve cells to other neurons that receive the signals. Long-range projecting axons, like the structural "warp" threads in a textile, interweave with the brain's own version of crossing, or "weft" fibers: axons that wind back and forth over short distances, transmitting signals to perform computations.
