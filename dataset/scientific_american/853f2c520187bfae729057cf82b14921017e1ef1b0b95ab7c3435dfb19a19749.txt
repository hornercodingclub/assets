mechanics teaches that the farther you move away from the nucleus of an
atom, the lower the probability of finding electrons that may belong to that
atom, but that even far from the nucleus there is still a finite probability
of finding the electrons. So, strictly speaking, electrons on the 'surface'
of molecules are very diffuse but carry an electric charge. "Because like charges repel, two molecules will resist being brought close
together. The shorter the distance between them, the more energy it takes to
push them to get even closer. If the molecules approach each other with
sufficient energy, however, they may exchange atoms or actually form a bond
(chemical reaction). Otherwise, their electron clouds will just deform to
avoid the large electrostatic repulsion, and the two will then fly apart
again." So the answer really depends on what the surfaces are made of and how they
interact. Atoms on the two surfaces may chemically bond to one another, and
in that sense touch; in other circumstances, they may just avoid one
another. 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
