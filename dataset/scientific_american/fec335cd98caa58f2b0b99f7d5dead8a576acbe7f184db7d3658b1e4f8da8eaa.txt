Read Our Latest Issue Brain regions that process faces reveal deep insights into the neural mechanisms of vision When I was in high school, I learned one day about the density of curves in an introductory course on calculus. A simple pair of differential equations, which model the interactions of predators and prey, can give rise to an infinite number of closed curves--picture concentric circles, one nested within another, like a bull's-eye. What is more, the density of these curves varies depending on their location. This is a preview. Make a selection below to access this issue.Already have access? .
