Although he is not known for the last occupation, in 1620 he put his work on hold, packed up his household and moved back home to Wurttemberg, Germany, to defend his mother in court on charges of witchcraft. Historian Rublack uses the facts of the case to explore the intellectual, political and religious turmoil going on at that time in Europe, as well as the complexities of Kepler's own beliefs, which encompassed both scientific rationalism alongside the possibility of magic: while maintaining that witches did exist, he insisted that there was no evidence his mother was one.
