standing diesel engineering dilemma called soot trade breaking trade soot nitrogen oxides research area highest priority diesel engine development says paul miles manager sandia engine research program dilemma engineers find way burn diesel fuel fully avoiding soot keeping temperatures low avoid excess nitrogen oxide years ago mueller realized thoroughly premixing fuel air ignition key solving problem potentially allowing charge burn leaner meaning fuel rich lower temperature achieve mixing iconic bunsen burner vertical tube creates clean blue flame came mind unscrew tube light gas jet tall sooty orange flame mueller says turn gas screw tube relight burner nice short blue flame
