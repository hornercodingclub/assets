Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in November 1905 "The Whitehead torpedo has exercised a greater controlling influence upon naval construction and tactics than perhaps any other single weapon of naval warfare. However, it cannot be denied that the torpedo has, at times, been greatly overrated. Indeed, the experience of the recent war seems to prove that only under exceptional and very favorable conditions can the torpedo get in its blow. In the fleet engagements on the high seas it seems to have exercised very little, if any, influence upon battle formations. Consequently, we think it unlikely that torpedo tubes will be fitted into future warships." -- , November 1905 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our . 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
