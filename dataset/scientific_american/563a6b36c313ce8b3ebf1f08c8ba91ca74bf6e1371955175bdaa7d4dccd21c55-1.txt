fusion research began earnest 30 years ago people simply not appreciate complexity subtlety science plasmas concomitant depth understanding needed controlled fusion work scientists vastly underestimated engineering requirements constraints result naivete unknown scientific hurdles natural closer gets goal practical energy longer step takes experimental devices grow larger expensive approaches commercially viable fusion reactor worth continuing fusion development scientists conclude burning fossil fuels inducing unacceptable global climate change limited number alternatives turn solar based sources photovoltaics ocean wind etc nuclear fission fusion solar based sources increasingly important niches not supply humanity bulk power demands particularly worldwide standards living continue rise nuclear fission
