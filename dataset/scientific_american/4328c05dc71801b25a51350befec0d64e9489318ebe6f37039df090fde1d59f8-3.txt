hit limestone layer cavernous holes engineers told limestone area explained aspect mystery sent mud high pressure mud disappeared eased pressure circulation returned engineers hubbert agreed pressure heavy mud opening fractures surrounding pressure not lift overburden weight rock pressing puzzled engineers hubbert realized engineers imagining fractures pancake like horizontal openings rock cracks open lift weight rock hubbert told far likely fractures vertical open push neighboring rock sideways usually require force like difference trying lift heavy door bank vault hinges compared swinging door hinges hubbert solved problem explanation underlying physics allowed engineers adjust drilling mud avoid lost circulation drill efficiently ~~~~~ stanolind
