The U.S. Space Surveillance Network tracks all man-made objects down to baseball-size fragments (10 centimeters wide). They pose a risk of serious collision with future space missions. According to a NASA analysis, even if humans stopped launching satellites now, debris will increase after 2055. That is when the formation of new pieces, resulting when larger ones break up, will exceed the rate of destruction by reentry burn-up. Percent of orbital objects that are debris: Number of fragments at least 10 centimeters wide: Combined mass, in kilograms: Number of known orbital collisions, 1991-2005: Number of collisions expected in the next 200 years: Number of collisions expected to be catastrophic:  Science This article was originally published with the title "Data Points" in Scientific American  294, 6, 26 (June 2006) doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0606-26a 7 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
