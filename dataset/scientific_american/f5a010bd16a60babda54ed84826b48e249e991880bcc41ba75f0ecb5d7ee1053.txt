Read Our Latest Issue A modest collection of small building blocks enables the design and manufacture of nanometer-scale structures programmed to have virtually any shape desired As a chemistry undergraduate in 1986, I dreamed of the possibility of designing and synthesizing macromolecules (molecules containing more than 100 atoms) that could do the amazing things that proteins do and more. I have programmed computers since the first TRS-80s came out in the late 1970s, and I thought it would be wonderful if I could build complex molecular machines as easily as I could write software. I wanted to create a "programming language for matter"--a combination of software and chemistry that would enable people to describe a nanomachine's shape and would then determine the series of chemical processes that a chemist or a robot should carry out to build the nanodevice.
