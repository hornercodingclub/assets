Read Our Latest Issue Willy Verstraete and his colleagues at Ghent University in Belgium tested the fuel cells in an array of configurations: in a series, in parallel and individually. Over the course of more than 200 days, the researchers fed the microbes a diet of anaerobic and aerobic sludge, as well as hospital and potato processing factory wastewater. By the end of the experimental time frame, the short-term power densities--a measure of power produced per unit of mass--of the fuel cells had tripled. The team also found that the parallel stack was most efficient at producing an electric charge, consistently creating stronger current. The scientists main discovery, however, had to do with the co-evolution of the electrochemical properties of the fuel cell and the actual microbial community. At the start of the experiment, the tiny power plants relied on a diverse community of proteobacteria, including several species of and and produced power somewhat inefficiently. But by the end of the experiment--when performance was at its peak--one species, made up the majority of the electron-producing microbes. This microbial evolution calls for further research into the electron-producing properties of various species and their interaction, the authors write. A paper presenting the findings will be published in the May 15 issue of David Biello is a contributing editor at .
