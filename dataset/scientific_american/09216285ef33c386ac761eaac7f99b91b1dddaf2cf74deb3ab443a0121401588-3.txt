fluid dynamics stated simply bernoulli law says pressure fluid decreases velocity increases vice versa bernoulli theorem attempts explain lift consequence curved upper surface airfoil technical airplane wing curvature idea goes air traveling wing moves faster air moving wing surface flat bernoulli theorem says increased speed atop wing associated region lower pressure lift mountains empirical data streamlines lines smoke particles wind tunnel tests laboratory experiments nozzles venturi tubes provide overwhelming evidence stated bernoulli principle correct true reasons bernoulli theorem not constitute explanation lift fact experience air moves faster curved surface bernoulli theorem not explain words theorem not higher velocity wing came
