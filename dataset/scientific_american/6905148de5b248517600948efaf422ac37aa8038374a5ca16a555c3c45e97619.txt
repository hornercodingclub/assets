Read Our Latest Issue What's with the excitement over these single-atom carbon sheets? Find out in this short primer For materials-science fans, graphene is one of those substances that's easy to get excited about. Not only is graphene transparent and superstrong--a sheet with the thickness of Saran Wrap could support an elephant--but it also conducts electricity very quickly. It could lead to computer circuits that run 100 times faster.  , a Yale University professor of mechanical engineering and materials science, explains the basics of graphene and demonstrates its electrical property with pencil marks on paper. The video is part of her "Material Marvels" series.  One of the discoverers of graphene, Andre Geim, won the (he indeed used adhesive tape on graphite to make graphene) and wrote about his work in his article, " ," in the April 2008 Scientific American (subscription required).
