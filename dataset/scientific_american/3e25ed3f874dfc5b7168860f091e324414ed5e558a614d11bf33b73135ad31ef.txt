It stands to reason that computers--which process information in discrete chunks--should be able to simulate nature fully, at least in principle. But it turns out that certain asymmetries in particle physics cannot be discretized; they are irreducibly continuous. In that case, says David Tong, author of " " in the December 2012 issue of the world can never be fully simulated on a computer.
