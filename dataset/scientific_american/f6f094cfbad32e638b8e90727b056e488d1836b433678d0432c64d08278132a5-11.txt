microarcseconds require telescope seven kilometers shorter wavelengths visible ultraviolet light help reduce gargantuan requirement somewhat not ridiculous considering longer wavelengths pointless millimeter radio waves instance require telescope 5,000 kilometers happens earth size radio telescopes operation technique called long baseline interferometry vlbi combines signals detected array radio telescopes sprinkled globe achieve angular resolutions earth size radio dish achieve arrays telescopes operating decade long baseline array vlba dishes u.s. far afield hawaii new hampshire european vlbi network evn dishes china south africa puerto rico europe remember seeing smaller system large array new mexico movies unfortunately vlba evn suitable radio wavelengths 3.5 millimeters
