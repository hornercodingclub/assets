Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in August 1951 "Even at the present very early stage of transistor development it seems certain that transistors will replace vacuum tubes in almost every application. A large part of the improvement in the performance of the device is due to the development of a new design called the 'junction transistor.' The early units consisted of a germanium crystal touched by two closely spaced fine wires--'cat's whiskers.' In the junction transistor this point-contact arrangement has been replaced by a large-area contact. It therefore operates more efficiently and consumes far less power." -- , August 1951 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our shiny . 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
