like towel considerable challenges overcome reaching promise said creating highly flexible displays require flexible substrate layer oleds applied glass substrate typically today said oleds need protected humidity oxygen pixels damaged stop working leo said glass substrate not difficult phone manufacturers switch flexible plastic substrate challenging oxygen humidity levels low added not oleds need flexible transistor backplane layer components responsible electronically switching pixel need flexible leo said said flexible organic transistors solve problem materials ways away commercially available means truly flexible displays not likely appear anytime soon according leo unlike curved phone screens flexible displays arrive cause real excitement leo said
