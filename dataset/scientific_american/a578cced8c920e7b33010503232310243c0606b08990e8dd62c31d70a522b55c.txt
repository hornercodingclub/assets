Read Our Latest Issue In the neurological netherworld between sleep and wakefulness, the mind's delirium can turn tragically real There was nothing outwardly unusual about the man who showed up at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center on June 27, 2005. Like thousands of other clinic patients, Benjamin Adoyo (not his real name) was a sleepwalker. A 26-year-old college student, originally from Kenya, Adoyo had been wandering at night since childhood.

Scared, she would simply do her best to rouse Adoyo, who, once awakened, never remembered a thing.
