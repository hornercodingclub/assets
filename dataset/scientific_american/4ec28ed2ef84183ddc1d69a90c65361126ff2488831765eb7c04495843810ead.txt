Read Our Latest Issue Read Our Latest Issue On the frozen plains of central South Dakota, the Missouri River takes a dramatic turn known as a meander bend, creating the 130-kilometer-long Lake Sharpe. Meander bends form as fast-moving water erodes the outer bank and deposits sediment on the more placid inner bank.
