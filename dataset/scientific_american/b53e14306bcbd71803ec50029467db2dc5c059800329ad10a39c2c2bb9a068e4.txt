Read Our Latest Issue Lithium-ion cells exploit various chemistries, but virtually all rechargeable varieties, including those in cameras and in cell phones, use lithium cobalt oxide in the cathode and graphite in the anode. Although this formulation is "inherently somewhat unsafe," according to Gerbrand Ceder, professor of materials science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, careful manufacturing and built-in safety devices have limited accidents to a handful. Still, Ceder explains, "battery makers have been pushing the state of charge" in a given cell because of electronics makers' demands for longer running time, so "there is now less margin for error." By stuffing more ions into the package, manufacturers have quadrupled energy capacity since commercial introduction in 1991. This is a preview.
