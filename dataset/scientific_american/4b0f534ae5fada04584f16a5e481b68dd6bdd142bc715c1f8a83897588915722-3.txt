researchers area noticed timing neuron fired varied trial experiment concluded timing not important began combining responses multiple trials produce average firing rate standard way quantify neural activity variability result neurons oscillation cycles practice ignores timing information needed reveal traveling waves conceptual framework grew single neuron sejnowski says brain works populations neurons interacting traveling waves comprise activity neurons spread brain invisible single neuron techniques decade new technologies appeared allow neurons monitored simultaneously given different picture sejnowski says time tools techniques going going generation accepted established neuroscience community optical methods like voltage sensitive dyes allow researchers visualize electrical changes thousands neurons simultaneously
