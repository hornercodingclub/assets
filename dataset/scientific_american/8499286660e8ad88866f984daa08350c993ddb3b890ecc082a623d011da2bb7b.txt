When stars go supernova, theoretical calculations suggested that those about 25 times the sun's mass or more turn into black holes; meanwhile less massive stars become dense, whirling balls of neutrons. One such neutron star, in the Westerlund 1 star cluster and examined by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, defies this calculation. Based on the size of the largest nearby stars, astronomers deduced that the neutron star's parent was among the biggest of them all--at least 40 solar masses. They suggest that extremely weighty stars might shed mass so effectively before they die that enough is left only for a neutron star. The findings, appearing in an upcoming , may severely limit the formation of black holes to stars between 25 and 40 solar masses.
