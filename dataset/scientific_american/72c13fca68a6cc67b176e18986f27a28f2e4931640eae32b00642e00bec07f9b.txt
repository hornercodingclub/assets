Read Our Latest Issue Scientists are creating mathematical tools to identify novel particles and phenomena at the world's largest particle accelerator The Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, is the biggest machine humans have ever built. Pooling the resources of more than 100 countries, it accelerates protons to within a millionth of a percent of the speed of light. When they collide, the protons break into their component parts (quarks and the gluon particles that glue them together) and create particles that were not there before. This is how, in 2012, the LHC achieved the first detection of a Higgs boson, the final missing particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Now physicists hope the LHC will find something genuinely new: particles not already in their current theory--particles that explain the mystery of dark matter, for instance, or offer solutions to other lingering questions. For such a discovery, scientists must pore through the 30 petabytes a year of data the machine produces to identify tiny deviations where the results do not quite match the Standard Model.
