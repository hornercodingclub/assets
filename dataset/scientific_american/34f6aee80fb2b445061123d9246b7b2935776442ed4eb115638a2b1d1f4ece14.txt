Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in May 1914 "Dr. Hugo Eckener of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin in Germany is responsible for startling revelations about aerial marksmanship as practiced by modern Zeppelins. From a safe altitude of 5,000 feet heavy bombs were dropped within circles marked by buoys on the water of the lower Elbe, of only 15 feet in diameter, showing that bombs could be dropped as well into the funnels of warships. Tests made on land showed that from an equal elevation a railroad station could be completely wrecked by four of these bombs." [Three months later World War I broke out; shortly after, Zeppelins dropped bombs on Liege and Antwerp in Belgium.] -- , May 1914 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our shiny . 6 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
