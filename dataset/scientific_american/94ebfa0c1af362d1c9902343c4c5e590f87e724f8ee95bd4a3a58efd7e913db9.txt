Read Our Latest Issue What does Sir Isaac Newton have to do with gridiron glory? Plenty, it turns out. In a special partnership with NBC Learn, we present supplemental information for the educational video series, "The Science of NFL Football" Passing, blocking, running, tackling, kicking--the main physical actions of American football illustrate several fundamental concepts in physics, biomechanics and math. Inertia, momentum, vectors and parabolas are as much a part of the game as helmets and huddles.  In partnership with the National Science Foundation and the National Football League, that explore several concepts:  * Newton's three laws of motion * The Pythagorean theorem * Projectile motion * Vectors *  Geometric shapes * Kinematics *  Torque *  Hydration and nutrition  All this week, we'll be providing additional stories that take the concepts explored in the video further. Here's a sampling:  1. When is a straight line not the shortest distance between two points? 2. How many pounds of water does an NFL player lose on the field? 3. Why has soccer-style placekicking replaced the straight-ahead, toe style? 4. How much energy does it take to stop a running back? 5. When it comes to a chase, how are ball carriers like zebras? (The real kind, not the ones with a whistle and yellow flag in their pockets.) 6. What shapes fly best?  So next weekend, when you are watching your favorite team square off with the opponent, you might have a chance to say the vector of the prolate spheroid perfectly traced a planned parabolic trajectory.
