Read Our Latest Issue Originally published in July 1907 "A new process for photography in colors has been brought out at Paris by Messrs. Auguste and Louis Lumiere, who are among the leading savants of France in this department of science. They are able to take a photograph in colors upon a single plate and in an ordinary camera, with exposures of one second or less. The specially prepared plate is formed by placing microscopic colored particles upon a glass plate (it is found that potato starch is the best adapted for the purpose). Three colors are used for the particles, and they form the color screens [filters] for the plate." -- , July 1907 More gems from 's first 175 years can be found on our shiny . 7 hours ago  --  Robert Z.
