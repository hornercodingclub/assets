One specialized in engineering, one in chemistry and one in computation. Turning to his colleagues, the engineer reported (translation follows): "All of the creatures here are solid, some segmented, with capacities to move on the ground, through the water or air. All extremely slow. Unimpressive." The chemist then commented: "All quite similar, derived from different sequences of four chemical ingredients." Next the computational expert opined: "Limited computing abilities. But one, the hairless biped, is unlike the others. It exchanges information in a manner that is primitive and inefficient but remarkably different from the others. It creates many odd objects, including ones that are consumable, others that produce symbols, and yet others that destroy members of its tribe." This is a preview.
