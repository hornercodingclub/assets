Would microbes be hardy enough to survive? We may soon find out. The Planetary Society, a nonprofit based in Pasadena, Calif., has packed --bacteria, yeast, even tiny invertebrate animals--into a capsule on the Russian Phobos-Grunt spacecraft, expected to launch as soon as November 8. The experiment, called Phobos LIFE, for Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment, is designed to test the hypothesis that early life could have hopped .
