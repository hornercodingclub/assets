It was thought Benjamin Franklin took the records from Ecton, the birthplace of his father, in the 1750s. Massachusetts Historical Society's Peter Drummey said they first went to London and then the US in the 1800s. He said they would "appropriately address" the return of the records which date from 1646. Mr Drummey, whose society currently holds the records, said that Franklin was "very interested" in his family links to Ecton and in the summer of 1758 he made a trip to the village to meet his extended family. He said from reading letters Franklin sent to his wife, he "seemed to take pride" in his roots and the "connection was very real". It was believed that during the trip Franklin took that tithe records from St Mary Magdalene church. Tithe records contained details about landowners and tenants and the taxes they paid to support the local church. Mr Drummey said they were "not sure" how the records left the church, but they showed up in London in the 1800s. He said an engineer called Wake bought them from an antiquarian dealer in 1850 and sent them to the US thinking the Franklin connection would spark interest. "It would be impossible to trace how they ended up in the US," he added. "I don't think you can assign any blame to Benjamin Franklin for them leaving Ecton." Currently, St Mary Magdalene has a copy of the front cover. Mr Drummey said they would now "explore" either returning the records or providing a full copy. Sally Bresnahan, chairwoman of Ecton Parish Council, hoped the records would help track down the "Franklin House" in the village. The house is referred to in Franklin's letters, but Ms Bresnahan said they were "not absolutely sure" where the house was, but the records should show what property or properties the Franklins owned. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
