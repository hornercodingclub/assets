Villagers in Brayford raised more than PS35,000 towards the work at All Saints church, High Bray. Each of the six bells, two of which are thought to date from the 15th Century, has been removed and sent away to a foundry for repair. The project is expected to be completed by Easter. The Reverend Peter Attwood, priest-in-charge, said: "The bells have been silent for nearly 30 years and it marks a project between the village and the church. "It's really caught people's imagination." He said the church was believed to have two of the oldest bells in the country, one dated 1415 and the other 1492. As well as the money raised by the villagers, the church also received PS20,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
