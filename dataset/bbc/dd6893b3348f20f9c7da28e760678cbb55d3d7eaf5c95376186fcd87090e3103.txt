The answer is no. Kilauea in the US state of Hawaii is one of the world's most active volcanoes and it has been very active in recent weeks. Its red-hot rivers of lava have destroyed dozens of homes on Hawaii's Big Island, with 2,000 people being told to leave their properties. Jay Furr from Richmond, Vermont asked the US government department whether it would be safe to roast marshmallows over volcanic vents using a long stick. Is it safe to roast marshmallows over volcanic vents?  Assuming you had a long enough stick, that is?  Or would the resulting marshmallows be poisonous?  The US Geological Survey's Volcanoes Twitter account, which posts official updates and information on volcanoes in the US, responded to Mr Furr's query, saying that such an experiment would lead to a "bad taste" and a "pretty spectacular reaction". They said it would not be safe and advised people not to try to do so. Last week, people in Hawaii were warned about toxic fumes produced when molten rock flows into the ocean. Erm...we're going to have to say no, that's not safe. (Please don't try!) If the vent is emitting a lot of SO2 or H2S, they would taste BAD. And if you add sulfuric acid (in vog, for example) to sugar, you get a pretty spectacular reaction. Kilauea is an extremely active volcano and its present eruption began 35 years ago. A growth of volcanic activity in recent weeks has meant that it has quite literally been erupting in people's backyards. Only one serious injury has been reported, after .
