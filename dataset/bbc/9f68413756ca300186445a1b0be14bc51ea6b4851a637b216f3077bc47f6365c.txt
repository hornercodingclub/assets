She first started treatment in 2017 and completed her treatment in May 2019. However, she relapsed earlier this year and now requires further treatment and chemotherapy. Her mother, Vicky Fletcher, said: "She's been through a really tough time the last few months, and it's something [the doctors] wanted to do for a while, but she's been so poorly, so it was a nice special treat for her." Izzy spent some time in intensive care because of an infection but is "a lot better now" and back in school.  If you're in need of a smile today... Get well soon Izzy! We hope to see you dancing again soon [?] Izzy is about to start another month of treatment, her mum said, adding: "She's doing ever so well, but [there is] still a long road to come. "We just want to thank [the hospital] so much and it does make such a difference to families to have that source of fun things to do, when there is a lot less fun things going on." Hospital staff picked up on Izzy's love of ballet while she was in for treatment and spent time reading ballet stories.
