Governor Kate Brown said the amount of land incinerated by fires in just the last 72 hours was twice the state's annual average, and that at least five towns had been "substantially destroyed." "We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across our state." Families like Sandra, Daniela and Ester Reyes returned to find their homes in Bear Creek, Phoenix, had been razed by the fires.

The remains of a basketball court still remain, while the picture below shows the intensity of the heat as a man holds a piece of melted metal. For those made homeless by the fires temporary shelters have been set up across the state.
