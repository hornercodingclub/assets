The Coconino County Sheriff's Office named the man as Christopher Swales, 55, who had been undertaking a tandem dive near the Grand Canyon on Sunday. Mr Swales' skydiving partner, who worked at a local parachuting centre, survived the fall. Police said the pair "encountered difficulties" while approaching a landing area at a local airport. "These difficulties caused the pair to free fall for an unknown distance and hit the ground in what was described as a 'hard landing'," a statement from the Coconino County Sheriff's Office said. Emergency services were called shortly before 10:00 local time but Mr Swales was pronounced dead in hospital. An investigation into the accident is continuing, according to police, although there are currently no signs of foul play. A UK Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that consular staff in the US were supporting Mr Swales' family. "Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time," the spokesman added. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
