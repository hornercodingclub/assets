Firefighters were retrained in case existing ambulance staff fell sick with Covid-19. More than 100 firefighters have been trained and will be joined by a further 60 from Avon Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters have also been trained to deliver basic medical care.

"There was less hand holding and it was interesting seeing it from a different point of view seeing the emotions the couple were going through and also the feeling of being able to help out," he said.
