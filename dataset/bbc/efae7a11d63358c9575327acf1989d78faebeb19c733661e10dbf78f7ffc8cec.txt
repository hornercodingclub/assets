Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington, who was the hearing's chair, said he expected "the utmost professionalism from all officers and staff at Essex Police and that extends to their conduct on messaging and social media platforms, whether on or off duty". He said: "The behaviour shown by these officers undermines the hard-earned trust of the communities of Essex. "It fell far short of my expectations and is out of step with the high standards of diversity, equality and inclusion, all of which are at the heart of what Essex Police stands for. "It damages the reputation of the majority of those working within Essex Police who value difference in all people and provide a high-quality service to the people of Essex."
