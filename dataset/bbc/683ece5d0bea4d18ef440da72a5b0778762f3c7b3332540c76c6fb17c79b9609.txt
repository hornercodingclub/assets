A report by one of South Yorkshire's most senior officers tells the county's crime commissioner of increasing drug gang violence and use of firearms. Sheffield District Commander Una Jennings told Alan Billings a dedicated Armed Crime Team had now been formed. Ch Supt Jennings said "Albanian gangs" had grown large amounts of cannabis. She said in the document: "In response to the series of [firearms] discharges across Sheffield, the force have made the decision to invest in a dedicated Armed Crime Team to respond to the threat posed by gun crime. "The key driver for this operational response is an increase in discharges driven by the activity of organised crime gangs involved in the supply of controlled drugs." In one week the Armed Crime Team uncovered large amounts of drugs including 3,239 cannabis plants with an estimated street value of PS2.9m and more than 30kg of dried cannabis. The team made 98 arrests, recovered three guns and PS63,000 in cash. Ms Jennings added that in three months to the end of June, 60 crime gang members had been arrested. In one phase of the operation 120 vehicles were recovered.
