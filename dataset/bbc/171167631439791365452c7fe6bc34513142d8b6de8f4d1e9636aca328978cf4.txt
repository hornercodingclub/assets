In one post, Dorset councillor Beverley Dunlop suggested banning mosques. Independent investigator Tim Darsley said she had been acting in a personal capacity when she made the comments. Members of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council's standards committee accepted the report but condemned the "unacceptable" remarks. Several posts made by the Moordown ward councillor in two different Facebook groups were included in a , highlighting alleged Islamophobia among Conservative councillors, according to the . In one of the posts, Ms Dunlop said: "I hate to ban anything really but I'd suggest we start with mosques." In another she said fundamentalists were "hiding in plain sight in the Muslim community" and that this would not change "until they are more frightened of the British government (because they and their families might get deported) than they are Isis". Ms Dunlop said her comments had been taken out of context. However, a formal complaint was made to the council by Bournemouth University lecturer Osman Ahmed in November last year. He said the comments brought the council "into disrepute" and Ms Dunlop should be "removed from her position". The council's standards committee agreed to accept Mr Darsley's finding. However, chairman Steve Baron, from the Poole People Party, said the remarks "could be looked at as bringing the council into disrepute". Green Party councillor Chris Rigby said the comments were "not acceptable" whether made in a public or private capacity. Conservative member Ann Stribley said: "This 'get out of jail' card is not a good enough excuse if we want to be respected in the public arena." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
