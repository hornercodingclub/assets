Emergency services attended the spill at Sharp's Brewery in Rock near Wadebridge at about 07:30 BST. The hazardous material had leaked from a container into a contained drainage system, Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said. No-one was injured. The brewery, which makes Doom Bar, said there was no risk to the wider community or environment. Sharp's Brewery said it had deployed "all the well-rehearsed, necessary measures for an incident of this type and followed all guidelines and procedures as appropriate". The spill is being cleaned up by a specialist contractor, the fire service added. Hydrochloric acid is used by the brewery to control the acidity of its waste effluent before it enters a treatment plant, but can cause chemical burns on the skin and severe injury if ingested. The brewery said more than a million pints of beer were brewed on the site each week. Teams from Devon and Cornwall Police, South Western Ambulance Service, Cornwall Council, the Environment Agency, South West Water and Public Health England were all alerted to assist following the spill.
