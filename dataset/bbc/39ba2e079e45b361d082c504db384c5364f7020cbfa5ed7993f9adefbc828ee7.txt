That is according to official figures from NI Statistics and Research Agency. Services - the biggest sector in the NI economy - saw output rise by 22.5% in the third quarter of this year after falling by 18% the previous quarter. Growth was reported in wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, transport and ICT. But overall services output is still lower than it was a year ago.
