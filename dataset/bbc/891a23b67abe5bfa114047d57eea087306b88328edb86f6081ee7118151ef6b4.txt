The increase includes a PS5 rise in the annual charge, taking it to PS90, and rises for "pay as you throw" stickers. The cost of 90-litre black bag sticker will rise by 20p to PS2.70, with a 10p increase to PS1.50 for a 50-litre sticker. The States said the increase would mean an average weekly household cost increase of about 20p, to PS4.60. This is 25% lower than originally anticipated, with the difference put down to the decrease in the amount of general rubbish; it has more "more than halved" , the States said. The cost of general rubbish disposal is paid for by the annual charge and by islanders purchasing and attaching a sticker to each black bin bag, while recycling and food disposal are free. Last year, 73% of Guernsey's household waste was recycled, up from half in 2017 and already ahead of the target of 70% set for 2030. It is also 8% better than . Income from the bag charge was about PS3m less than anticipated last year and a shortfall is also expected this year, following a decision to freeze the cost in 2020, the States said. While the reduction in cost of sorting and disposing of this waste has offset some of this, States-run Guernsey Waste declared an operating loss of about PS1.4m in 2019. The commercial waste charge will increase from PS240 per tonne to PS246. The increases in household charges are expected to raise PS255,000 in revenue, while commercial rises should generate PS54,000, the States said. The rises are due to be voted on in December.
