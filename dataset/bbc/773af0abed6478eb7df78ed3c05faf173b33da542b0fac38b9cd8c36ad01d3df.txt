In Wales, the number of deaths from all causes rose from 797 to 836 in the latest week. The proportion of excess deaths for this week in Wales was 23.1% higher than average, compared to the 14.6% higher in England. But so far this year, the proportion of excess deaths in England (13.6%) is higher than in Wales (10% higher than average). The total number of Covid deaths in Wales up to and registered by 4 December was 3,892 deaths. When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is a total of 3,983 deaths occurring up to 4 December. So far in the pandemic, Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) has seen the most deaths in Wales - 559, while its rate of deaths is the second highest across England and Wales for its population size. Registered deaths involving Covid-19 are where the virus is suspected or confirmed and where doctors consider it a factor in a death, although in around 90% of cases it is the underlying cause.
