The Rolex Submariner 5513, purchased from a jewellery shop in Doncaster, is one of the few with a dial showing only the numbers three, six and nine. These Explorer dials were normally replaced with a standard numberless dial when they were serviced. The watch, which had only been owned by the person who bought it in 1966, also came with its original receipt. Because the watch had never been serviced its dial had never been replaced, Rolex designed its Submariner watch for use by recreational and professional divers. The watch was sold on Wednesday along with more than 500 other lots at Gardiner Houlgate auctioneers in Corsham, Wiltshire. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
