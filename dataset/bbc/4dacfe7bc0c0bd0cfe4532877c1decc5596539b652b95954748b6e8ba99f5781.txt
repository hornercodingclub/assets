About 47 miles (75km) of fibre optic cable is to be laid on the seabed off Port Erin and Port Grenaugh, part of which will pass close to a protected scallop bed near Chicken Rock. Environment Minister Geoffrey Boot said it was "not feasible" to avoid the bed. However, he said relocating the scallops would "ameliorate the damage". A local fishing vessel, the FV Coral Stand, was used to remove the molluscs from a 4.6-mile (7.5km) stretch of seabed. The government has not revealed where the queen scallops, , have been relocated to. The cable-laying is part of a wider project to install the 584-mile (940km) Havhingsten Telecommunication Cable, which will connect the island to Ireland, the UK and Denmark. A government spokesman said the new link would provide the island with an "improved internet connection" and "faster speeds". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
