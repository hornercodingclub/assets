Barbara Humphreys died in hospital in November 2018 following the incident at Crosfield House in Rhayader, Powys. The care home's operators admitted a health and safety offence before magistrates at Merthyr Tydfil on Wednesday. Sentencing will take place at a later date. Prosecutor Chloe Ward said a decision was made to fit a rail to Ms Humphreys' bed in August 2018, despite information they "can create a risk of entrapment".

Ms Ward said a subsequent Health and Safety Executive investigation found "fundamental failings" in the management of the bed railings, including in risk assessments and staff training. She said this demonstrated "systemic failings" on behalf of the defendants to manage the bed railings. The home's operators pleaded guilty to breaching .
