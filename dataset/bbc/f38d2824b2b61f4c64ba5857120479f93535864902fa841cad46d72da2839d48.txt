As of 23 October, all prisoners in one wing of the west London prison had begun isolating after displaying symptoms of Covid-19. The Ministry of Justice said 59 inmates in total were isolating. "Five or fewer" required hospital treatment. Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer said staff had implemented "strong measures to mitigate this risk". In a Ms Frazer said: "Closed settings such as prisons pose particular challenges in managing outbreaks. "Prisoners, including those who are isolating, have unlimited access to washing and toilet facilities.
