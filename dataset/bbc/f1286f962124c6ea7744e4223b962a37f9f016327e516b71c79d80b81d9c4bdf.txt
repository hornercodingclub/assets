Businessman and classic car enthusiast Richard Colton, died in 2015. He left two rare Ferraris to the charity, which later sold for about PS8.5m at auction - the most valuable items ever left to the organisation in a single donation. Part of the money funded new equipment in Hastings, while PS2.8m paid for the new station at Pwllheli, Gwynedd. Mr Colton left the RNLI a red 1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB, which sold at auction for PS6.6m, and a 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4, which raised PS1.93m. Work on the new boathouse is now complete, although Covid delayed the manufacturing of a new lifeboat - due to arrive in April. Pwllheli lifeboat operations manager Cliff Thomas said: "Receiving this fantastic news really was a shock. What an exceptional Christmas gift for us all. "This latest donation really is a humbling end to what has been a difficult year for everyone." Clive Moore, Pwllheli coxswain, said: "We are a small Welsh station and the move to the new building and site will mark a significant period in the history of the station. "I find it remarkable and very humbling that a gentleman who had no seafaring connection should have the desire to support the RNLI through the sale of his treasured cars, and that we should now benefit at Pwllheli as a consequence of his generosity." The local community has also raised PS83,000 towards the new station. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
