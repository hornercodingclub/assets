Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was found unresponsive at a house on Cranmore Road, Shirley, in Solihull, on Tuesday and later died in hospital. A post-mortem examination found he died from a head injury. Thomas Hughes, 27, and his partner Emma Tustin, 31, who both lived at the address, face the same charge. They are due to appear before Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Monday. "Arthur's death is deeply distressing," Det Insp Laura Harrison, from West Midlands Police, said. "We have specialist officers with his family as they grieve his loss." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
