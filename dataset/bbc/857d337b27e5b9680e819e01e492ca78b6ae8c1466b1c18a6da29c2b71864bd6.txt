When consulted, Paul the octopus chose a mussel from a jar with the German flag on it ahead of one in a similar jar bearing the cross of St George. The two-year-old cephalopod has a record of predicting past German results in this manner, his owners say. Paul has so far correctly predicted all of Germany's results in South Africa. His keepers say he correctly predicted nearly 70% of Germany's results during the 2008 European Championship. In that contest, Germany finished as runners-up in their qualifying group, having lost only once to Croatia. They then progressed to the final, where they were beaten by Spain. If keepers at the Oberhausen Sea Life Aquarium are right, he correctly predicted the outcome of four of the six games in that competition. "Paul's prediction was phenomenal," said aquarium spokesman Tanja Munzig. "He swam straight over to the German glass, climbed in and even put a lid on top once he was sitting inside." The octopus, which was born in the UK and was moved to the German aquarium, has become a national celebrity after correctly predicting Germany would beat Australia in their opening match, then lose to Serbia, and then beat Ghana. His latest prediction was flashed all over the German media. The container that Paul opens first is said to be his pick for who will win the impending match, keepers say. Germany finished the initial stage of the World Cup top of Group D, and face England, the runners-up from group C, in Bloemfontein on Sunday. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
