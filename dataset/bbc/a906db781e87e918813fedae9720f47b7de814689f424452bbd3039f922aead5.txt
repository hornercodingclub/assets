The Paralympic-style Invictus Games will see servicemen and women take part in sports like wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing and sitting volleyball. The prince said the competition would recognise the sacrifice made by those who fought for their country. He has been working to bring the event to the UK after seeing something similar in the US - the Warrior Games. "I have witnessed first hand how the power of sport can positively impact the lives of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women in their journey of recovery," Prince Harry said. "The Invictus Games will focus on what they can achieve post-injury and celebrate their fighting spirit through an inclusive sporting competition that recognises the sacrifice they have made." The prince said he believed the competition would have a "long-lasting impact" on the well-being of those who have "served their nations so bravely". Harry officially launched the Invictus Games at the former Olympic Park's Cooper Box arena - where events including handball, modern pentathlon and fencing took place during the 2012 Games - in Stratford, east London. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
