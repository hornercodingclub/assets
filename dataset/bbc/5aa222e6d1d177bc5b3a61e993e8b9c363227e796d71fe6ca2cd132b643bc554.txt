Joshua Freemantle, 17, had planned to show his Life of Lowestoft film at the town's Marina Theatre in June but it was cancelled by Covid-19 restrictions. Joshua said he was inspired to share his hometown's "beautiful beach and hidden heritage". The film will be shown at the East Coast cinema on Tuesday night. After the original premiere was delayed by lockdown, the teenager turned his attention to taking photos of Joshua said he hoped the film would promote Lowestoft as a destination, by telling the story of the Suffolk town's culture and history. "We always wanted this documentary to make people see Lowestoft in a new light." said Joshua. "We want to change the perception of the town by highlighting bits of its history that are less well known." The project was made possible after it received PS7,400 in funding from the East Anglia Art Fund, Lowestoft Rising, Making Waves Together, East Suffolk Council and Kirkley People's Forum. As well as showing Lowestoft in war time, the film also has a section detailing life under lockdown earlier this year. "Lowestoft is a unique, special place to be with a beautiful beach, beautiful hidden heritage, and most importantly, the first place to see the sun rise in Britain," Joshua added. "It is no longer being over looked as a town failing from a once-thriving fishing industry, as it is now becoming a renewable energy hub." BBC Radio 4 broadcaster, Zeb Soanes, who is from Lowestoft, said the film was a "positive, optimistic piece" and "will give hope and swell pride in what the town has to offer". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
