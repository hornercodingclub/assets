The Tinbergen Building was designed by the architect Sir Leslie Martin, who also designed the Royal Festival Hall at the South Bank Centre in London. It was completed in 1970 and named after Dutch biologist Niko Tinbergen, who taught at Oxford from the late 1940s. He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1973, and died in the city in 1988. Demolition is expected to be completed on the building later in the year.
