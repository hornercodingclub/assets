Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) was called to a property in Canterbury Way, Netherton at about 18:00 BST on Wednesday. When firefighters arrived, they found an outbuilding fully engulfed in flames and the body of a man inside the house. His death is believed to be the result of a tragic accident, MFRS said. "The cause and the circumstances have been investigated by the police and our incident investigation team," Mark Thomas from MFRS said. "The initial investigation indicates this was a tragic accident after a garden fire has developed out of control." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
