Ben Brown, 22, from Gloucester, who was in his final year at Loughborough University, died last month. His mother said he was a "shining star" who "had time for everybody". About 800 people in 10 teams around the country will be walking or running the equivalent of Loughborough to Istanbul and back between them to raise PS30,000 for charity. Jamie Molyneux, 22, and Jack Morrell, 21, fellow engineers and housemates of Mr Brown, said for each member of their team of 80 it would be about the equivalent of completing two marathons. The pair will also be "tabbing", which means they will march carrying 25kg for 12 miles. Talking about the death of Mr Brown, who attended Welbeck Defence Sixth Form College in Loughborough from the age of 16, Mr Molyneux said: "We never suspected it. "Ben was always a really happy, cheery person, always looking out for other people and always had a smile on his face." Helen Hartery-Brown said her son, who was due to start officer training at Sandhurst in September, "instinctively knew when somebody else needed help but little did any of us know that he was suffering himself". "We've got to be kinder to each other and kinder to ourselves," she said. "If we've got a problem we've got to talk about it, especially in these unprecedented times." eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
