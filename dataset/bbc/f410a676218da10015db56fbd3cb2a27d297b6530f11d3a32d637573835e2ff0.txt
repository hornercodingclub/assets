After selling personalised key rings and mugs to increase that figure to PS400, Tyler Lopes bought a camera. Over the past few months the 14-year-old, of Hebburn, South Tyneside, has taken a number of "doorstep portraits" and captured deserted streets. His father, Michael Cooke, said the youngster "has done his grandma proud". However, social distancing guidelines have made it difficult for the Hebburn Comprehensive School pupil to get as near to his subjects as he would like. "It's been a bit of a struggle as I like to get up close to capture facial expressions," he said. "I've never seen anything like this before so it's been a great opportunity to show the isolation but also capture how much families have been enjoying spending time together." The youngster, who is studying photography as part of his GCSEs, first discovered an interest in the subject when he began using his mum's mobile phone. When his grandmother died in January 2018, he decided to use his inheritance to help fund a Nikon D3400 camera and sold customised items through his parents' home-run business until he had the PS400 needed. "He's put a lot of effort into it," his father said. "He always wants to go out with his camera and take pictures. "He likes working with other children and manages to engage with them and capture a moment in time. He has the eye for it. "A lot of it has come about through word-of-mouth on Facebook and other generous people have given him opportunities." (c) 2021 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
