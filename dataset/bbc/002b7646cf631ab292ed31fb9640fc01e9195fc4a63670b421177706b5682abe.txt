A spokesperson for the Western Trust told BBC News NI the issue was over the number available on Sunday afternoon. It is not related to the Covid-19 pandemic. A baby requiring intensive care born in the hospital within the next 48 hours would likely be transferred to another hospital, the spokesperson said. This is in line with the Northern Ireland Neonatal Network, that all Health and Social Care Trusts are part of. The BBC understands an expectant mother was informed about the lack of beds when she attended a check-up at the hospital on Sunday morning. She has since been transferred to another hospital. "If a baby is born in Altnagelvin Hospital within the next 48 hours and it requires intensive care treatment, it is likely that the baby (and mother) will be transferred to a hospital with an available neonatal intensive care bed," said the spokesperson. "The decision to move a mother and baby pre or post-birth to a different hospital is never taken lightly. "It is taken by senior obstetricians along with the neonatal team and they will always prioritise the safety of the baby or babies when doing so." In a further statement to BBC News NI on Sunday evening a spokesperson for the trust said the neonatal unit has been "temporarily relocated" to enable maintenance work to occur. "We anticipate that the unit will be reopened on 7 September 2020 once the maintenance works can be completed as planned,"  said the spokesperson. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
