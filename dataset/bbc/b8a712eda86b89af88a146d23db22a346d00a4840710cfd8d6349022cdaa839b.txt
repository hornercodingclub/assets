The project, which is called European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs (ESPAD), is led by Sweden. It aims to identify teenage drinking patterns, levels of alcohol-related problems and illicit drug use. In 2009 it was found that 61% of island teenagers were drinking to excess, one of the highest figures in Europe. The survey takes information from many European cities including Austria, France, Germany, Greece and Switzerland.
