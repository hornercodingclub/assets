The Sea-to-Sky gondola's main cable was severed at about 4am local time (11:00 GMT) on Monday, the operator said. No staff or guests were on the line at the time and no injuries were reported. In August 2019, almost 30 cars on the gondola, in Squamish, north of Vancouver, fell to the ground after the cable was deliberately cut.
