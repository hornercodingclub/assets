The man, who has not been named but was 54 years old, ate about one-and-a-half bags of black liquorice every day. He had suffered no symptoms before suddenly going into cardiac arrest in a fast food restaurant. Describing the man's case in , his doctors said the glycyrrhizic acid in liquorice was to blame. "We are told that this patient has a poor diet and eats a lot of candy. Could his illness be related to candy consumption?" Dr Elazer R Edelman said. He said studies had shown glycyrrhizic acid - the active ingredient in liquorice - could cause "hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, fatal arrhythmias, and renal failure" - all of which were seen in this patient. Hypokalemia is when a person's potassium levels in their blood become dangerously low. The patient had also recently changed the type of sweets he was eating. A few weeks before his death, he switched from red fruit-flavoured twists to another type made with black liquorice. Another doctor, Dr Andrew L Lundquist, agreed in the report that the liquorice was to blame. He wrote: "Further investigation revealed a recent change to a liquorice-containing candy as the likely cause of his hypokalemia." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
