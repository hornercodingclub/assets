The students from the University of East Anglia in Norwich were supposed to be self-isolating after showing symptoms of Covid-19. Norfolk Police were called to the house in Bowthorpe Road, outside the university campus, in the early hours of Sunday. The university said it fully supports the actions of the police. One Bowthorpe Road resident, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC: "They are just irresponsible and don't care about their neighbours. "They are not protecting themselves or other people." Norfolk Police said a 19-year-old woman and two 20-year-old women had been issued with the fixed penalty notices. In a statement, the force said at 01:10 BST on Sunday officers had found "up to 100 people attending a party at the address". Under the coronavirus restrictions a maximum of six people are allowed to meet. It said officers had been "liaising with the University of East Anglia in recent weeks to ensure students are adhering to the current restrictions". A University of East Anglia spokesperson said: "We fully support the actions of the police. "Students, like everyone else, have to adhere to the law and where there is a breach of the rules they should expect to face the same consequences as others in the community. "In the vast majority of cases our students are behaving responsibly." The university said it will "be looking into this matter and taking appropriate action". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
