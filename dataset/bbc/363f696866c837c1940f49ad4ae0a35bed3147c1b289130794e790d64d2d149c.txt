Schoolchildren, volunteers and councillors planted the first 105 trees in Cornwall Council's ambitious Forest for Cornwall in Saltash. It is the flagship project of the council's climate change action plan, aiming to be carbon neutral by 2030. The Woodland Trust said "Cornwall is in the lead" when it comes to planting new trees. Planting the first tree was Edwina Hannaford, cabinet member for climate change at Cornwall Council. She told the : "It is a really ambitious project but with lots of help like we have here today we will be able to plant a lot of trees and hedgerows." The council is launching a 'treeometer' which would monitor how many new trees are being planted and was asking people to post their efforts on social media. The project will see trees planted all over Cornwall with an aim to create 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of new tree canopy. The council will also be encouraging more hedgerows to be planted. Ross Kennerley, south west regional director of the Woodland Trust, said "looking across England and the south west I would say that Cornwall is in the lead" when it comes to planting new trees. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
