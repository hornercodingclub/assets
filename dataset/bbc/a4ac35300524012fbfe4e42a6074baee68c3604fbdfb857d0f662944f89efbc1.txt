ChatHealth will offer young people in Wiltshire aged 11-19 the chance to talk privately without having to meet face-to-face. Wallet-sized cards printed with the helpline number will be sent to schools in the county over the coming weeks. Charlotte Forward from ChatHealth said the free service can help "ease fears". "Young people can encounter a whole range of problems as they are growing up and being able to talk through problems or worries, completely confidentially, can be a huge help by either easing their fears or confusion or by helping them find ways to cope with their difficulties," said Ms Forward. ChatHealth - which will be available Monday to Friday from 09:00 to 16:00 - is provided through Public Health Nursing for Virgin Care, which runs the school nursing service in Wiltshire.
