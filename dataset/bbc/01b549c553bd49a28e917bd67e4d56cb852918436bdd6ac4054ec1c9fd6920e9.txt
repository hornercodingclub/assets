It was on a low-flying training exercise when it became snagged in power cables at Hundon in Suffolk. An Army spokesman confirmed the Apache "made a controlled, precautionary landing at Hundon Grange near Haverhill after a wire strike". The incident happened at around 12:40 GMT on Tuesday with the aircraft landing in a field. The spokesman said: "Both crew were uninjured and were on a routine training sortie that originated from Wattisham Flying Station. "As with all incidents involving military aircraft, there will be a thorough investigation." The contact with the overhead cables caused a power cut, leaving around 60 homes in the village without electricity until 20:00. The first reported that after landing one of the pilots knocked on residents' doors to explain what had happened. The Apache, based Wattisham, has been used for sorties in Afghanistan and Libya, where it was used to tanks. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
