Fort Paull is a gun battery and fort on the north bank of the Humber Estuary a few miles east of Hull, that has been a museum for 20 years. In a statement the fort said "due to unforeseen circumstances" it would not be reopening after its winter closure. Former museum curator Wally Duggan said the plane was the "last of its type." The 10-acre site has an eclectic collection of military history items. Mr Duggan, of the closed Beverley Museum of Army Transport where the Blackburn Beverley had been displayed, said: "It isn't something you put in your back garden but they were marvellous and served all over the world. Mr Duggan said the plane, that arrived at Fort Paull in 1983, deserved a long-term future and somewhere to display it. The Tyrannosaurus Rex model has been part of the fort's play area for a decade and was made by the late Ron Brodie from Hull. Sadie Brodie, his granddaughter, said "We don't want it left there to rot away and be damaged." Ms Brodie said she had been assured that they could arrange to collect their items. The tourist attraction's Facebook page appears to have been taken down but an earlier statement on it said: "Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances Fort Paull will remain closed and won't be reopening. "So this page will also be closed down, we would just like to thank all our loyal customers and rally/event teams for their support and custom over the years before we close it, thanks again all the staff at Fort Paull." The BBC has been unable to contact the museum for comment. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
