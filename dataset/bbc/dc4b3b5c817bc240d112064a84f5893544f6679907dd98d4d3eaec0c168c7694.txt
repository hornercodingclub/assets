The 43-year-old officer was responding over concern for a man living in Portswood Road, Southampton, at about 12:00 BST on Thursday. Hampshire police said the officer suffered "serious, but not life-threatening, injuries" and had to stay in hospital overnight. The arrested man, a 51-year-old from Southampton, remains in custody. Peter Crawford, who lives in the road, said it appeared the policeman had an injured arm. He said: "I saw all these police cars... and there was a guy at the front of one - I didn't realise he was a policeman at the time - I saw him bandaging his arm up. "And I saw a guy come out with the police with handcuffs on behind his back." Zoe Wakefield, who chairs Hampshire Police Federation, said the injured policeman was with a colleague when he was attacked and has since been released from hospital. She said: "The officers acted very bravely and I think the situation could have been a lot worse." A force spokesman said detectives were working to establish the exact circumstances of the attack. Det Ch Insp Dave Brown said officers were conducting inquiries, including house-to-house visits, and examining CCTV footage. "At the same time, we are providing support to the officer's family and his colleagues following this incident," he said. The force did not believe there was any wider risk to the public, Det Ch Insp Brown added. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
