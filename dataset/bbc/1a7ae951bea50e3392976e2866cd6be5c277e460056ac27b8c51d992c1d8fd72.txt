Currently, some institutions class Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey as international students and charge more than double the UK student rate. The agreement will stop that practice for new students and require existing students' rates to be lowered. The Manx government welcomed the move. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the change would provide students with "certainty over their future goals". About 1,500 Manx students attend higher education facilities in the UK, with the vast majority of them studying in England. A Manx government spokesman said that while most universities and colleges gave the island's students equal treatment, an "increasing number" had indicated they planned to categorise them as international, which could see them paying about PS20,000 annually, as opposed to about PS9,000. The agreement does not cover universities and colleges in Scotland and Wales, which set their own fees and where island students pay the lower UK fee. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
