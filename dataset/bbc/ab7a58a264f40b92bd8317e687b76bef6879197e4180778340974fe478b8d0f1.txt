The region's combined authority said the number of roads failing to hit government pollution targets by 2020 will be 14 times higher than feared. It called for the government to fund car scrappage schemes and low emission vehicles to tackle dirty roadside air Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) said roadside nitrogen dioxide levels were a "public health crisis". It will meet on Friday to discuss progress on the , which aims to find ways to reduce air pollution caused by traffic. The government ordered councils in Bury, Bolton, Manchester, Salford, Stockport, Tameside and Trafford to implement a clean air plan no later than the end of 2020 after a by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) found excessive nitrogen dioxide levels. It added Oldham to the list in a . The study predicted 11 stretches of road would be over the legal limit of 40 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air after the deadline. GMCA's own study has revealed 152 roads are likely to be in breach of the threshold by the end of 2020 and . They include main arteries in Manchester - which was revealed in September to have - and Salford. Councillor Alex Ganotis of GMCA said: "We're calling on the government to give Greater Manchester the tools we need to tackle the problem together - this means a local vehicle scrappage scheme and funding for cleaner engines for buses and taxis". GMCA said it would not introduce a congestion charge but was considering clean air zones which would charge drivers of vehicles which caused the most pollution. A Defra spokesman said it was working with GMCA to improve local air quality and Greater Manchester had received PS250m from the government in the last two years to reduce emissions. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
