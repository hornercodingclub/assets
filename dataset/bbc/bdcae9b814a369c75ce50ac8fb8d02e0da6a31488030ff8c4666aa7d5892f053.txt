Broomhill Swimming Pool in Ipswich opened in 1938 but has been closed since 2002. Ipswich Borough Council's planning committee gave the project the green light, but told the developers, Fusion Lifestyle, to consider the impact of car parking in the area. The project has to wait to hear if it has been awarded a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) next month. If it gains the PS3.3m funding, the developers aim to reopen the pool in 2020. The Broomhill Pool Trust, which has been campaigning for the lido to reopen for 15 years, said it was "absolutely delighted" the project had passed this "major milestone". Under the plans, the Grade II-listed pool's water will be heated to "take the chill off", the architects said. The original lido was heated, but during World War Two the boilers were removed for the war effort and never replaced. The lido's Wicksteed diving boards will be restored and the facility will also include a fitness centre, new changing rooms and a small refreshment area. Peter Gardiner, chairman of the planning committee, said it would be "great" to see the pool where he learned to swim as a boy reopened. The council said the original 50m (165ft) pool and children's pool closed because it became too expensive to run. It still owns the pool and has pledged PS1m towards its restoration. The rest of the money will come from Fusion Lifestyle's own pocket. The first stage HLF grant, of PS180,000, paid for specialist testing, surveys and design development for the restoration of the pool. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
