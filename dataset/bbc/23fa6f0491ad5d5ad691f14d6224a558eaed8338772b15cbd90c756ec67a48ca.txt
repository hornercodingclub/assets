The monument, in memory of the soldiers who were killed by a roadside bomb in Ballygawley, Police said the memorial at Curr Road was damaged overnight on Thursday. The First Minister Arlene Foster condemned the vandalism via Twitter. They have confirmed they are treating the incident as a sectarian hate crime. Victims campaigner Kenny Donaldson described the vandalism as "an act of ethnically motivated hatred". The director of the South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF) said "to desecrate a space which seeks to respectfully remember the dead is beyond words". Mr Donaldson condemned those responsible as having "no concept of respect or common decency". "The community must cooperate in providing information which could lead to the successful prosecution of the individuals concerned," he said. In a tweet, Alliance councillor Stephen Donnelly condemned the actions of those who carried out the attack, saying it would cause further trauma to the relatives of the victims. Saddened to hear that the Ballygawley bus bomb memorial was vandalised last night in what the PSNI are treating as a sectarian hate crime. Those who have lost loved ones to violence in our past should not be disrespected and retraumatised by abhorrent behaviour of this nature. DUP leader Arlene Foster also called on the public to help the PSNI identify the person responsible. She said the vandalism was carried out by "a certain type of sick person". Please help identify those responsible for this act of hate. Takes a certain type of sick person. Northern Ireland would take a step forward if the person who thinks this is acceptable behaviour was brought before the courts and severely punished. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
