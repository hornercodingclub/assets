"Four weeks ago Liverpool's Mayor Joe Anderson called for a 'circuit breaker' in Liverpool to stop the virus spreading so rapidly," the MPs said. "We have been kept in the dark and not told the whole truth of the scientific advice the government has received. Our city is being treated with contempt." The MPs have requested further information on the scientific evidence behind "circuit-breaker" lockdowns and called for more support for the region, the has said. "People also need security. Without proper financial support, Liverpool risks being dragged back to the 1980s," the MPs said.
