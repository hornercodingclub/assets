Paul, from the Sea Life Aquarium in the western city of Oberhausen, chose a mussel from a jar with the Spanish flag instead of one with a German flag. The two-year-old cephalopod has become a national celebrity. According to his owners, he has a record of predicting German results. They say Paul chose the winner in nearly 70% of Germany's games during the 2008 European Championship. He correctly predicted all five of the team's previous World Cup games - including a shock defeat by Serbia in the group stages. His prognosis ahead of Wednesday's World Cup semi-final was broadcast live on German TV. Correspondents says Paul's plumping for Spain has caused alarm in the country, but some analysts point out that his predictive powers are not perfect. During Euro 2008 he wrongly picked Germany as the victor against Spain. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
