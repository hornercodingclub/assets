Dyfed-Powys Police said a number of people had overdosed after buying drugs being sold as Xanax, a benzodiazepine, in Llanelli. The force said the combination was particularly dangerous as both drugs sedate users and suppress breathing. Drug users should get immediate medical help if they become ill, it said. A force spokesman also urged people to share this information with anyone who could come into contact with the drugs. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
