Ruth Saunders, from Newbury, took some inspiration from centenarian Capt Sir Tom Moore, . She began her challenge on 8 September, walking around the block near her home each day but finished the challenge at Newbury Racecourse earlier. The money raised is going to Thames Valley Air Ambulance (TVAA). Ms Saunders started taking daily walks during lockdown and planned to do 104 walks, matching her age, before her granddaughter encouraged her to try to cover the distance of a marathon. Just after 11:00 GMT, the pensioner crossed the finish line at the parade ring in Newbury Racecourse. She said: "I am pleased I've done it. The last two or three laps were a little bit touchy, the weather was bad, but I did it. "When I start something I always want to finish it, no matter what it is." Acknowledging Captain Sir Tom, she said while chuckling: "Tom, I've done it." Ms Saunders raised more than PS31,000 for the air ambulance. Thames Valley Air Ambulance said the pensioner was "incredible". "She has really captured the hearts of people. Raising that amount of money just makes a huge amount of difference for us," a spokeswoman added. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
