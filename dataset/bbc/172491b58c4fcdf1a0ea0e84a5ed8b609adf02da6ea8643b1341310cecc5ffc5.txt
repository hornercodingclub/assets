Senator Ian Le Marquand, Jersey's home affairs minister, recommended the appointment of Mike Bowron to the States of Jersey. Mr Bowron is currently the commissioner for the City of London Police. If approved by members of the States of Jersey he will take up the post early in 2011. Mr Bowron launched the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau and is currently the Association of Chief Police Officers' lead on economic crime and business continuity. Senator Le Marquand described him as an experienced and dynamic officer. He said: "The future holds both opportunities and challenges for the States of Jersey Police Force and I am confident that he is well equipped to meet these." Mr Bowron said: "It is a genuine privilege to be offered this post and I undertake to work with and for the people of Jersey to maintain the very highest standards of policing." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
