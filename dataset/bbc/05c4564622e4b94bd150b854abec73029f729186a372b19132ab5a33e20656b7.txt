Paul McIntyre, 52, denies murdering Ms McKee in Londonderry in April last year, possessing a firearm and being a member of the IRA. He was originally but was kept in custody pending the appeal by the PPS. On Friday a judge at Belfast High Court overruled the decision to grant bail. Ms McKee, who was 29, was observing rioting in Derry's Creggan estate when she was shot on 18 April 2019. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) appealed the decision to grant bail to Mr McIntyre, arguing there was a risk he could commit more offences if he was released. The High Court judge heard two days of and this week. She determined the risk of re-offending was enough to justify keeping Mr McIntyre in prison. "The factors outlined by the prosecution are relevant, sufficient and plausible reasons to outweigh the other factors and justify detention," she said in her ruling. Mr McIntyre, from Kinnego Park in Derry, watched Friday's judgment by videolink from prison.
