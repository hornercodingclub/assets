Joh Vinding, chairman of the Fur Free Alliance (FFA), said: "The Prada group with its brands now joins a growing list of fur-free brands that are responding to consumers' changing attitudes towards animals." The FFA is a coalition of more than 50 animal protection organisations. Animal fur will not be used in its designs or new products, but items already made will continue to be sold.

Brigit Oele, programme manager for Fur Free Alliance, said: "Prada Group was one of the fastest companies to go fur-free once positive dialogue began a little more than a year ago."

However, MPs have called for a ban on sale of real fur to be considered.
