Dr Anne McCloskey said she was "reluctantly" resigning due to her views "differing considerably" with that of pro-life party Aontu. The GP, who also stood down as deputy leader almost two weeks ago, said she will remain a party member. Dr McCloskey is one of only two Aontu councillors in all of Northern Ireland. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Dr McCloskey said: "Over the last months my views on the government response to the coronavirus crisis has differed considerably from Aontu's party policy. "I understand that as a political party you need to have a cohesive approach, party leader Peadar (Toibin) was saying things differently to what I was saying. "All of that really wasn't useful," she added. Aontu leader Peadar Toibin said that the party will hold a selection convention in the coming weeks to co-opt a successor to Dr McCloskey. Mr Toibin said Dr McCloskey "held enormous respect in Irish politics" and was "not afraid to question and challenge the status quo". A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that it has received notification from Dr McCloskey of her intention to resign as the Aontu councillor for the Ballyarnett area. The spokesperson said the council would be informed by the chief electoral officer of the nominee for the vacant seat. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
