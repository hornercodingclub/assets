James Wilkinson, who works at Newark Marina in Nottinghamshire, was dredging the water at about 11:00 GMT when he uncovered the device. A specialist bomb disposal unit carried out a controlled explosion to detonate the 18lb and 6in long "highly explosive" device. Mr Wilkinson said: "I am just glad that it's now out of the way." The controlled explosion took place at Sconce and Devon Park, in Boundary Road, at about 15:30. A 100m cordon was put in place and the park was closed to the public. Mr Wilkinson added: "I've never come across a bomb from the First World War so it was a surprise to discover it. It was in a very poor condition. "I know Newark is known to have had a lot of bombs thrown at it during the war but you still don't expect to find one." Sgt Simon Brooks, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "It's very rare that we come across a World War One shell and when it was detonated it did go off with quite a bang." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
