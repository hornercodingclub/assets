The Wedgetail aircraft will be based alongside submarine-hunting planes and fighter jets at the Moray base. The fleet will begin to arrive in 2023, although no decision has been taken yet on how many aircraft that will mean. The Wedgetails will carry advanced battle-management technology allowing those on board to track other aircraft and ships over land and sea. The base has seen major investment in recent years, including a runway upgrade. It is hoped the Wedgetail announcement could lead to further investment, as well as military and civilian jobs. The E-7 Wedgetail surveillance aircraft are based on Boeing 737s, as are the Poseidon P8s already on site at RAF Lossiemouth. Defence Minister Baroness Goldie said: "Scotland's proximity to the waters and skies of the North Atlantic is of crucial importance to the UK's and Nato's security - this is why important military bases such as HMNB Clyde and RAF Lossiemouth are located here. "The decision to base the E-7 Wedgetail at RAF Lossiemouth demonstrates our commitment to investing in Scotland, and will complement and expand upon the success of Typhoon fast jet and submarine hunting Poseidon operations." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
