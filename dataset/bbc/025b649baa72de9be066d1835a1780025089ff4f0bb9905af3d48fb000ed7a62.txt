The leaders in the North West issued an open letter warning of "greater levels of enforcement" for those "who feel the restrictions don't apply to them". They said the message was aimed "particularly [at] those organising large gatherings and music events" or "repeatedly holding parties". Those who ignore fixed penalty notices will also be targeted, they said. The letter has been issued on behalf of the chief constables from Lancashire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Cumbria and Cheshire police services. In a joint statement, Darren Martland, Michelle Skeer, Ian Hopkins, Andy Rhodes and Andy Cooke urged the public to help "prevent any further suffering" and said their officers will be more "robust" with people "incapable of demonstrating any civic responsibility". However, they also thanked the majority of people who they said had tried "so hard to comply with restrictions". They said they had always tried to maintain a "measured approach", but said they would be seeking support from the government to pursue people who ignore fixed penalty notices, which can be up to PS10,000. The letter continued: "To the minority who feel the restrictions don't apply to them be prepared to face the consequences of greater levels of enforcement. "We will collectively target those who flout the restrictions, particularly those organising large gatherings and music events, repeatedly holding parties or deliberately causing harm to our communities by not following the restrictions, such as self-isolating where necessary."
