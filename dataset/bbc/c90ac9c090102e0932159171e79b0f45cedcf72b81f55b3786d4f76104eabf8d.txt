Burkitt, who was , had been working as a cleaner on the Holly House wing of the prison. The report's author, Sue McAllister, said: "We are satisfied the prison offered to move Ms Burkitt to a different wing which they were using to shield vulnerable prisoners but that Ms Burkitt refused and opted to remain in her own cell, despite being advised of the risks. "We are satisfied that Ms Burkitt was taken to hospital promptly when she became unwell. "We consider that the prison should have required Ms Burkitt to stop working and self-isolate when she presented with one of the three major symptoms of Covid-19 [a high temperature]. "Not doing so put other prisoners and staff at risk - although it did not affect the outcome for Ms Burkitt herself." The report recommended that the governor and head of healthcare should ensure prisoners or members of staff who developed Covid-19 symptoms follow Public Health England's guidance and self-isolate for 14 days. A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Protecting the lives of those who live and work in our prisons is our priority and the steps we have taken, based on the latest advice from Public Health England, have helped save many lives." yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
