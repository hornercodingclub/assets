Ben Hunter is covering the distance from his home in Inverness to where Joyce Wilmot, who was 88, lived in Matlock, Derbyshire on a static bike. His mum Wendy Hunter said he has been covering about 43 miles (70km) a day in the garden whatever the weather. Ben is raising money for Derbyshire, Leicestershire & Rutland Air Ambulance. Mrs Wilmot, who died on 19 April, had wanted donations from her funeral to go to the charity, but because of the lockdown Mrs Hunter said "hardly anyone could attend". "We were all close to her and disappointed we couldn't come down for the funeral," she said. "Ben felt sad that not much could be raised." She added that he came up with his back garden challenge after being inspired by Captain Tom Moore, who raised more than PS32m for NHS charities by . Capt Moore has since been made an honorary colonel. "He's always thinking of others," she said. "It wasn't surprising he came up with the idea." Ben, who has been covering about 70km (43 miles) a day, started his challenge on Monday and has so far raised PS685. He initially hoped to complete the distance within the month, but Mrs Hunter believes at the rate he is going, it could be next week. "He's pedalling away, even in the rain," she added. Chloe Bass, from Derbyshire, Leicestershire & Rutland Air Ambulance, described the challenge as "fantastic". "We want to say a huge thank you to Ben. I'm sure that his great-grandma would be very proud. "We recognise that families can't say goodbye to their loved ones in the usual way during this difficult time, and really appreciate all donations that we receive in memory of them." eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
