Bristol's CORE said it "strongly and unequivocally condemns this racist, cynical and outrageous attempt to gain from the suffering of others, particularly at this highly sensitive time in both local and global terms". "We do not accept that this was a mistake," it added. "We do not accept their subsequent apology, again tweeted, and including a reference to the brand they wish to sell." The statement added the company had "exposed their true nature and/or ignorance" and it had "also stained the reputation of their home, Bristol".
