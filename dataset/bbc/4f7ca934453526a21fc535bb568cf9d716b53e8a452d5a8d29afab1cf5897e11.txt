The British overseas territory forms part of an island chain, alongside the neighbouring US Virgin Islands. Tortola, the largest of the 16 inhabited islands, is home to more than three quarters of the population. Named by Christopher Columbus in 1493, the islands were settled by the Dutch until 1666. They became part of Britain's Leeward Islands colony in 1872, gaining a limited degree of self-rule in 1967. A new constitution adopted in 2007 established a greater degree of self-government. Tourism and offshore finance dominate the economy, with financial and business services accounting for nearly half of the islands' GDP. A huge leak in 2016 of documents known as the "Panama Papers" revealed the islands to be the most popular tax haven by far with clients of the Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The leak threw new light on how the rich and powerful hide their wealth and caused a global stir. Further revelations were made in the "Paradise Papers" in 2017. The governor is responsible for external affairs, defence, internal security, public services and the administration of the courts. The territory has a ministerial system of government.
