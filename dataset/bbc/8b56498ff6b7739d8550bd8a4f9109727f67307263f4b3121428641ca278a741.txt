The Gloucestershire Warwickshire Steam Railway (GWSR) will now be extended to the Cotswolds village of Broadway.

Mr Bristow said some investors had donated more than PS10,000 to the project, which would see trains return to Broadway for the first time since 1960. Work to repair five "deteriorated and abandoned" bridges along the proposed route has almost been completed, he said.
