The city council was given a final warning by the European Commission in 2017 to clean up its air by 2020 and could be fined PS60m if it fails. Motorists in petrol cars built before 2006 and diesels before 2015 will have to pay PS8 under the proposals. The chargeable area is within the A4540 ring road, but not the road itself. Analysis by the local authority found air pollution was responsible for shortening the lives of about 900 people a year. The authority was granted PS38m from the Clean Air Fund towards mitigation costs, although it wanted PS50m, and PS14.2m despite wanting PS17.8m to go towards implementation costs, Up to PS15m will go towards supporting Hackney Carriage and private hire drivers who argue the zone is a threat to their livelihood. Councillor Waseem Zaffar said getting more than three-quarters of the money asked for was "substantial". Mr Zaffar, the council's transport and environment lead, said the authority would also try to address the potential problem of people "dumping" their cars near the edge of the zone and walking into the city. Vehicles entering inside the ring road will be picked up by automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
