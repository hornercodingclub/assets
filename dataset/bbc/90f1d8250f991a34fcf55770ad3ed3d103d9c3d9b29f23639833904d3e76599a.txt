Sign writer Kieran Hadley and artist and designer Bobbi Rae have started by painting nine media boxes with bold slogans. The council scheme aims to make streets, squares and parks, more inclusive and child friendly. The designs include phrases like "This is Leeds" and "Bring It To Life". The team behind the Our Spaces project said it showed Leeds had the ability to take pride in its identities and cultures. Mr Hadley, of Third Eye Signs, said his murals could now be seen on walls and shop fronts of several independent businesses around Leeds. Recounting the number of people who stopped to talk to him while he painted, he said: "An old lady came up to me once and said, 'Are you here to make us happy?' and I thought yes actually, I am." The project was commissioned by the council after it asked people who live and work in the city how they would like it to look and feel. Sarah Priestley, principal officer for culture and sport at Leeds City Council, said she asked Mr Hadley to get involved after working with him on another project in Chapel Allerton. yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
