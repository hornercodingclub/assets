In September, Ms Jephson told the charity she had identified her relative as she watched the Canadian broadcast. "During their discussion about the history of Wrest Park, I was very surprised to see a photo of my grandmother," she said. "It is wonderful that my grandmother's collection will now also become part of the archive and it is especially lovely that several other nurses will be recognised as well." Ms Jephson also shared the contents of her grandmother's autograph book with English Heritage, which included information about wounds and personal messages. One soldier wrote Ms Buller a poem on 9 November 1915, which described her as being "as sweet as sugar" and her presence as "a pleasure". Andrew Hann, English Heritage lead properties historian, said the women had been "forgotten", but they were "the backbone of the hospital and a crucial part of the war effort".
