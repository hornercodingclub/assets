The Dean and Vice Dean of Peterborough Cathedral were doing flipping well in the annual race when both fell. One of them, Canon Tim Alban Jones, said: "The cassocks were probably incidental - we both slipped on the gravel and came off rather the worse for it." Both were battered and bruised, but otherwise "absolutely fine". Teams of four were taking part in the relay race around the cathedral precinct on Shrove Tuesday when the clergy came a cropper with their crepes. Liz Hurst, cathedral spokeswoman, said: "The Vice Dean [Canon Alban Jones] was flipping his pancake when the wind caught it and he took a tumble. I don't quite know what happened to the Dean [the Very Reverend Chris Dalliston] - but they both went down." "It all happened very quickly. One minute he was up and running with a pancake, and the next he was down," she said. "He is recovering well, although he has superficial cuts and bruises and will probably look as if he has done a couple of rounds with Tyson Fury for a while." The race was won a team of tossing accountants from local firm Moore East Midlands. Canon Alban Jones said: "If you're going to ask me what I'm going to give up for Lent, the answer is running." Congratulations to for retaining the Cathedral Pancake Race cup for another year!
