Instead, they only suggest that specifically the animal market in Wuhan may not have been the origin of the new coronavirus.

He adds that "this would not be a surprise" since the facility was "totally shut down" last year due to "an absence of safeguards to prevent pathogen leakages". In fact, , the facility was not shut down, but only suspended its research, and a spokeswoman said there were "no leaks of dangerous material outside the laboratory".
