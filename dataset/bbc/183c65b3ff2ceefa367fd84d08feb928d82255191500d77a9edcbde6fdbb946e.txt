Investigators are unclear if the incident was an error or the result of espionage, the paper says.

The Hellfire is a laser-guided missile that can be deployed from an attack helicopter or an unmanned drone. Quoting sources close to the investigation, the Wall Street Journal said that the missile had been shipped to Spain in early 2014 to be used in a Nato training exercise. It was then taken through Spain and Germany and eventually to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris where it was to be shipped back to Florida. However, it was instead loaded on to an Air France flight to the Cuban capital, Havana. US officials are worried that Cuba could share the advanced technology inside the missile with countries such as North Korea, China or Russia, the paper adds.
