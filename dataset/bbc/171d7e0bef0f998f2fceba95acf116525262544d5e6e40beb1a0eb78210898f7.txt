Marston's, which took over the Havelock Street brewery in Bedford from said it had invested PS250,000 on upgrading the site. The building and business in the town will be known as The Eagle Brewery. Gordon Keen, of Marston's, said 18 beers are currently brewed there, but that would increase. "We now plan to take a local brand and make it nationwide," he said. A shop and visitor centre, which will run weekly organised tours, has been added to the site since the takeover. "It is really important we do not forget the past, but a lot of people do not realise that Bedford has a brewery," said Mr Keen, Marston's marketing manager. Charles Wells, which opened its first brewery in the town in 1876, is now concentrating on running more than 200 pubs across England and France. Peter Wells, commercial director at Charles Wells, which is still based in the town, said the firm was "still very much a big part of Bedford". "We are currently in the process of deciding upon a site for our new brewery, which will open in 2019," he said. "We've also committed PS2.5m to develop and improve pubs in our estate over the next 12 months." The Eagle Brewery currently makes Eagle, Bombardier, Courage and Young's bitter. Marston's said one of the reasons they bought the brewery is because they are able to can beers on site, which was something they "could not do" at any of their other breweries.
