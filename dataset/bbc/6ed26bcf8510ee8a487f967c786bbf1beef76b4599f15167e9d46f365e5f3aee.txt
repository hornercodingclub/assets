The event, originally due to take place in summer 2020, , but will now be held in Tregaron, Ceredigion, in August 2022 The Llyn and Eifionydd festival in Gwynedd now moves to August 2023 and Rhondda Cynon Taf will host in 2024. Ashok Ahir, management board chairman, said "Naturally, we're all very disappointed we've had to take this decision again." He added: "But I'm sure everyone will agree it's the right and sensible decision. "We look forward to getting together in Ceredigion, once the virus has waned, and I'm sure that the Ceredigion eisteddfod will be a festival to remember." The National Eisteddfod was initially postponed to 2021 when coronavirus began to spread in the UK. Chief executive Betsan Moses said: "As a team, we're more disappointed than anyone about it, and having to announce this for the second time has been incredibly difficult." She said AmGen - an online version of the festival - would take place again, "building on last year's success". "Announcing this today is heart-breaking for everyone involved in the Eisteddfod," Ms Moses added. Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn backed the decision, but said it would be "strange" without the event. She added: "However, everyone's health and safety is the main priority. Organising or preparing to compete and attend the Eisteddfod is a big task. "With all the planning that needs to be done, it is not practically possible to carry them out this year." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
