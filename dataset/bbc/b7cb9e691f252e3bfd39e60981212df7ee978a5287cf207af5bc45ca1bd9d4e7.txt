From 1 January, people must show a driving licence, council tax bill or a utility bill to use sites in Lamby Way, Wedal Road and Bessemer Close. The council said 17% of users at Bessemer Close were from a neighbouring authority. It said such "cross border movement" costs the council PS430,000 a year. Bob Derbyshire, cabinet member for environment, added: "It therefore seems fair to me that if residents from outside our catchment area want to use our facilities they should be asked to either pay for using it or directed to their own authority's HWRC [Household Waste Recycling Centre]." New seasonal reduced opening hours will also start in 2016 to account for reduced demand during the winter months. From 2 January, the site will open from 09:30 GMT with last entry at 18:00, while weekend openings from 10:00. Longer opening times will return in the summer.
