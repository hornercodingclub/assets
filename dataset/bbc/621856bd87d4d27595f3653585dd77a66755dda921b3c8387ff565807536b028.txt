The bodies of Nicole Smallman, 27 and Bibaa Henry, 46, were discovered at 13:00 BST on Sunday in Fryent Country Park, Brent. The women had been celebrating Bibaa's birthday with a group of about 10 people on Friday evening, police said. Their deaths are being treated as suspicious, the Met Police said. Police said the group of partygoers had gradually dispersed until only the pair remained. The sisters were both reported as missing to police late on Saturday when they did not return home, before they were discovered on Sunday. Det Ch Insp Simon Harding, of the Metropolitan Police, said: "We are in the very early stages of the investigation and are working hard to find out what led to these two women losing their lives. "I need to hear from anyone who was in Fryent Country Park on the evening of Friday, 5 June, or early into Saturday, 6 June. "The area the group were in would be a well-known spot to sit and look over London. If you were in that area of the park and noticed the group, or saw anything else suspicious, please contact us immediately." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
