David Farrant had been working in a field when he became trapped by a piece of machinery linking his tractor and a baler, an inquest heard. The 76-year-old sustained fatal injuries while working in a remote field near Wiveliscombe in Somerset. Senior coroner for Somerset Tony Williams recorded a conclusion of accidental death. The inquest heard Mr Farrant, who lived at Clatworthy near Taunton, had sustained multiple traumatic injuries and was found by his friend Thomas Gill. Mr Gill said he had been due to meet Mr Farrant on the day of the incident in October and was worried when he did not show up. He said finding Mr Farrant had left him "shocked and saddened". "David was always on about safety because there had been a fatality at the farm 13 years ago. "He was eccentric and made odd decisions on many occasions," Mr Gill told the inquest. Police and a Health and Safety Executive inspector had said the tractor and baler were in poor condition. Coroner Mr Williams, said: "David Farrant became entangled in an unguarded power take off shaft between his tractor and baler and sustained fatal injuries." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
