"Criminal individuals and gangs are using the uncertainty created by Covid-19 to recruit disadvantaged young Londoners, many of whom have lost their jobs and in some cases their accommodation."

"Young people were likely forced to work in the counties for longer and harder to meet the high demand, with some boroughs reporting longer missing episodes during lockdown," the report said. "It is believed some young people were switched to working on local drug lines to meet the local demand, meaning they were less likely to trigger missing reporting despite continuing exploitation. "Social care staffing levels were reduced during lockdown, and face to face engagement had to stop. "This impacted the provision of support to young people during this time."
