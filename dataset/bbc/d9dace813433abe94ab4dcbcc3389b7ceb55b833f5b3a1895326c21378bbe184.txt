The Lagan Valley MP takes over from Nigel Dodds, who lost his Westminster seat to Sinn Fein's John Finucane in last week's election. The party has also elected Sammy Wilson as its chief whip, taking over the position from Sir Jeffrey. The changes were announced following a meeting of the parliamentary party on Tuesday. Following his election, Sir Jeffrey paid tribute to Mr Dodds, describing him as someone who "commanded respect right across the House of Commons". "The initial focus of this Parliament will undoubtedly be Brexit and the prime minister's withdrawal deal," he said. He added his party would continue to seek changes to the deal to ensure "Northern Ireland's economic and constitutional integrity will be protected". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
