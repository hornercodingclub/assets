Dr Robert Quinn has been summoned by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service to appear in February 2019. He was involved in the care of Lucy Crawford. She was one of five children whose deaths were investigated by the Inquiry. The chair of the inquiry, Mr Justice O'Hara found four of those deaths were avoidable.

Alan Roberts, father of Claire Roberts, and Marie Ferguson, Raychel Ferguson's mother, said they welcomed the move. It is alleged Dr Quinn prepared a written report in which he failed to record information relating to Lucy who died in April 2000, that he reached the wrong conclusion in respect of fluids administered and gave a misleading impression of the care provided.
