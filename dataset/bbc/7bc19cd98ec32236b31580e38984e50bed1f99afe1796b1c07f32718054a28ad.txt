Dean Kirk, from Derby, assaulted the prisoner at HMP Nottingham in April 2016. He and two colleagues, Daniel Botterell and Joseph Wilson, were also following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court earlier this month. Botterell and Wilson were both found not guilty of assault. Kirk resigned from his position in November 2017 prior to a disciplinary hearing, while Botterell and Wilson were dismissed in December 2017. Following the trial Nottinghamshire Police said the trio "abused their positions as prison officers". Kirk, 31, was given a 10-month sentence suspended for 18 months, and must complete 100 hours of unpaid work, pay a victim surcharge of PS140 and costs of PS5,000. Thirty-year-old Botterell, of Great Sturton in Lincolnshire, and Wilson, aged 32 and from Hucknall, both received five-month sentences suspended for 12 months, and must complete 50 hours of unpaid work and pay a PS115 victim surcharge and PS2,500 costs. The Ministry of Justice said it has "zero tolerance for this kind of appalling behaviour". A spokesman said: "It doesn't represent the prison service or the vast majority of our hardworking and dedicated officers, and we will always take the strongest possible action against it." eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
