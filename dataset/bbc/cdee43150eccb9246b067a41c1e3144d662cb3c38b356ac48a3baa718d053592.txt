President Vladimir Putin visited the new base, on Alexandra Land, last month. It is built on stilts - to help withstand the extreme cold - and will house 150 personnel on 18-month tours of duty. Winter temperatures typically plunge to minus 40C. Covering 14,000sq m (151,000sq ft), it is the second Putin-era Arctic base to be built for air defence units. The first base to be completed was Northern Clover on Kotelny Island, further east. A military airstrip is also under construction in Franz Josef Land, called Nagurskoye. Russia is building four other Arctic military bases - at Rogachevo, Cape Schmidt, Wrangel and Sredniy. Experts say the melting of Arctic sea ice - generally attributed to climate change - is making the polar seas more accessible for shipping.
