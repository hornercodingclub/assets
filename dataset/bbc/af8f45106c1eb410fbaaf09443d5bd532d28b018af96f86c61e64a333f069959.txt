Labour-run Sefton Council wants to turn the site - which had a PS3.3m revamp - into a food and drink venue. Council leader Ian Maher said the market had "failed", adding that their plans would "address the future". But Conservative councillor Sir Ron Watson warned against copying the Altrincham Market concept that the town. He said he was a regular visitor to the Greater Manchester town since his daughter lives nearby. "I can assure you there isn't the slightest comparison between Altrincham and Southport market, and there will never ever be," Sir Ron told a meeting of the local authority on Thursday. "I hope we will come forward with proposals," he added, "but they need to be costed, they need to be thoroughly thought through, and we need to be told how they're going to be achieved and in what time frame." The town's former Liberal Democrat MP and current councillor John Pugh said the public need to be properly consulted. He told the BBC: "We can't compete head-to-head against Liverpool One or the Trafford Centre and we shouldn't do." Mr Pugh also questioned why the council was trying to attract traders from outside the town with street markets. Last month, Sefton Council unveiled proposals for how the market could look in future. , it said it wanted to draw inspiration from the "European culture" of "social eating". The current market has a number of empty units. Last week a large wooden wall was put up, closing half of the site. The council said this was a temporary measure to allow them to manage the market more efficiently. One stall holder said she had concerns about not being kept up to date with the plans and said she had not been told the wall was to be installed. Sefton Council said nothing has yet been decided. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
