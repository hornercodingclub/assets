Hagibis - meaning "speed" in the Philippine language Tagalog - is Japan's biggest typhoon in six decades. It hit the Izu Peninsula, south-west of Tokyo, shortly before 19:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Saturday, before continuing to move up the eastern coast of Japan's main island. The storm has affected the Rugby World Cup games and the Formula One Grand Prix. Torrential rain caused water levels to rise in a number of rivers, including the Arakawa. A railway bridge across the swollen Chikuma river collapsed in Ueda. Residents in Kawasaki were faced with a huge cleaning up operation as the floods receded. Several people were killed and others are missing. Here a rescue worker checks a residential area inundated by the floods. As the storm approached on Saturday, usually crowded tourist spots were almost completely deserted, including Harajuku - one of Tokyo's most famous shopping areas. Those caught in the rain struggled to make their way back indoors as the typhoon approached. The typhoon brought transport systems to a standstill. Metro and train services in Tokyo were suspended and flights grounded. Many in Tokyo tried to protect their homes and businesses from the incoming storm. Firefighters were later seen patrolling the city's flooded streets. Some evacuated residents took shelter in a sports hall in Tokyo. Hotel guests in the district of Sengokuhara were also forced to seek shelter, while the typhoon left roads in the area covered in debris. People's homes and businesses were caught in heavy flooding in Ise, central Japan. And a tornado prompted by the typhoon destroyed homes and dismantled electrical poles in Chiba Prefecture, east of Tokyo. (c) 2021 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
