Regular testing will be offered to all staff - even those with no symptoms. The letter, written by chief executive Sir Simon Stevens and chief operating officer Amanda Pritchard, sets out the NHS's approach in the coming weeks, following a drop in hospital patients with Covid-19 over the past two weeks in England.
