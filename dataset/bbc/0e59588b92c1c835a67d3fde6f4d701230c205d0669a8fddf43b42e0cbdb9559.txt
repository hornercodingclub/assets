Cheshire Police found weapons including a rifle and a crossbow at a number of addresses in Liverpool, Widnes, St Helens and Warrington on Wednesday morning. Four men, aged 29-51, and three women, aged 34, 36 and 62, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis. Detective Chief Inspector Giles Pierce, from the Serious and Organised Crime Unit, called it "a massively significant result". Police say the arrests follow the investigation into an organised crime group allegedly supplying drugs to gangs in Warrington. "It is a massively significant result in our determination to disrupt organised crime gangs operating from Warrington and supplying these drugs further afield," said DCI Pierce. "This conspiracy came to our attention following previous investigations into two organised crime gangs in Warrington. "Those arrested are suspected of being part of a well-established organised crime group who we believe were operating at a high level across the north west." Police also seized a car, watches and other designer items, and the people are in custody will be questioned by police. The raids in Liverpool took place in the Old Swan, Norris Green and Walton areas.
