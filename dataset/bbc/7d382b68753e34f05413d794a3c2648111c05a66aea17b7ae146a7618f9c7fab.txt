Wye Valley Butterfly Zoo was flooded by waters up to two metres deep in the wake of . Due to lockdown restrictions, contractors are only now starting to return to continue repairs. Lindsay Heyes, who runs the site in Symonds Yat, said work was likely to take months. He added it may have to remain closed until tourism numbers pick up again in Easter 2021. February's floods caused "unprecedented" damage to buildings and other infrastructure, Mr Heyes said. Seven of its 200-odd butterflies died and staff had to clean every leaf to remove the mud left behind. "We worked frantically," Mr Heyes said. "The amount of work was incredible." Lockdown then brought repairs to a halt and together with the original flood damage resulted in  a "severe economic impact" on the business. Although , indoor attractions like butterfly centres must remain closed. Even if the government allowed them to reopen, however, Mr Heyes said parts of the attraction were still drying out and were in no shape to reopen yet. "We're here looking after butterflies all the time, but opening to the public has large costs," Mr Heyes said. "It's unlikely to be profitable during the winter period." "People in this valley have really suffered. It's been one thing after another after another." He is nevertheless optimistic. The business has benefitted from the government's furlough scheme, and made early plans for coping with the pandemic. "We will rise again," Mr Heyes said. "So will the river, but we will too." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
