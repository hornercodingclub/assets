Nelson's, in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, has produced its blue-coloured Charity Gin, to "celebrate, thank and raise funds" for the NHS and its workers. A donation of PS15 from each sale of the PS39.95 bottle is being made. The gin-maker said it had sold out of its initial supply in two days. The same donation is also being made from purchases of another of its limited edition gins, with money raised going to the NHS Charities Together Covid-19 Fund. The distillery recently announced it was switching some production to manufacture hand sanitising gel, which has been in short supply. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
