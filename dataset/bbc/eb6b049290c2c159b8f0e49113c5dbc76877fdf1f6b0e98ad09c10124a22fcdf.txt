Carl Davies, 33, from Kent, died on Reunion Island in November 2011. The death was initially treated as an accident, but a murder investigation was started 10 days later. His sister Kerrie Stewart said the family had been told the trial should start by the end of next June. "We live in a nightmare that is never ending," Ms Stewart said. "You want to wake up some days and say 'get me off, I've had enough'. "I'd like to wake up one day and feel normal and that's not something that any of us have been able to do." She said the trial would help the family rebuild their lives around her brother's memory. Mr Davies, a former marine, is believed to have arrived on the French-governed island on 7 November 2011. His body was discovered two days later and a murder investigation started on 19 November. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
