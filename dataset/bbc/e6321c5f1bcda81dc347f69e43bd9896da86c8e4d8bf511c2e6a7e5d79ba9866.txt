Officers responded to reports of two "loud parties" around midnight on Sunday at University Avenue and Sandymount Street in south Belfast. They also found "large numbers" of people at a party at Castle Street in the city centre on Saturday evening. PSNI Ch Insp Sayers said officers took "appropriate action". He added that "the current health restrictions are not a game". "Across Northern Ireland, people are making sacrifices, not visiting family members or friends and businesses have temporarily closed. "People congregating or travelling to parties really need to consider their actions for their own health and that of the wider community." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
