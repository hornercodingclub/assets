Ricky Kieran Hughes, 37, caught police attention at about 04:00 GMT on 6 December when he twice pulled off the M6 in Cumbria to turn around. He was stopped at Tebay services where officers found 600 crack cocaine and heroin wraps in a paint pot in the boot of his Nissan hire car. Hughes admitted possessing the drugs with intent to supply. Hughes, of Boatmans Walk, Ashton-under-Lyne, also admitted possessing cannabis found in the vehicle and obstructing a PC, having initially given bogus identity details to police. "He was acting as a courier," said his barrister Matthew Buckland, "working off a debt." The court heard he was jailed as a teenager for supplying class A drugs, and then again for four years in 2013. Jailing him for 2,045 days - or just under five years and eight months - Judge Nicholas Barker said he had committed a "serious offence", adding: "There is a significant problem with the movement of drugs up the M6 from Liverpool." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
