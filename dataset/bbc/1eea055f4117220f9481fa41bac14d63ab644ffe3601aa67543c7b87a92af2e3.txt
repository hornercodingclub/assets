I remember having a really fun talk with Meghan as we were setting up to shoot the wedding and we were just wrapping up our time together," he told industry website Deadline. While two of the best-loved characters may have left, it isn't the end for Suits as season 8 has already been confirmed. Speaking in January, Aaron said the new series would "have everything from shifting alliances and internal power plays, to secrets, betrayals and fiery relationships". . .
