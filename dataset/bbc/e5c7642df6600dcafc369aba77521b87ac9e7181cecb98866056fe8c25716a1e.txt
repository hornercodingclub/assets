Doris the iguana of Simon Everitt, as he fought flames in a Corby house on 6 January. The pet escaped unscathed by hitching a ride on his helmet. Mr Everitt, from Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service, said Doris was "a bit of a lump". The living room of the house in Whitworth Avenue was smoke-logged when crews arrived shortly before midnight, Mr Everitt said. He added there was very little visibility. "You couldn't see your hand in front of your face," he said. "As I was crawling around... I felt something on my head and I just thought it was [another crew member] searching around. "Then, all of a sudden, the tail sort of moved in front of my helmet and I might have made a little screech... and then I had a big clawed foot scrape across my visor. "[Doris] was a bit of a lump - it frightened me initially - but obviously I... got on with the job in hand." As the crew made their way out of the house, Mr Everitt said his fellow firefighter spotted the iguana perched on his head and "wasn't sure whether to help, or just laugh". He added the photograph of the rescue had "gone everywhere" on social media. "I'd always dreamed of maybe females throwing themselves at me after joining the fire service - but sadly it was a scaly-type female called Doris," he said. The blaze, which took hold at about 23:40 GMT, was caused by "a faulty reptile heated mat in the living room", the service concluded. While there was some damage to the living room, the unhurt iguana was returned to her owner and there were no other injuries.
