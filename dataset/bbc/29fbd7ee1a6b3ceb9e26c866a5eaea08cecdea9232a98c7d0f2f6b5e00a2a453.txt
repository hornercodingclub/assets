Prince Philip, 98, travelled from the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk as a "precautionary measure". Buckingham Palace said the admission was for "observation and treatment in relation to a pre-existing condition". The Queen was at St Mary Magdalene with Prince Edward and his family. She is expected to attend the same church on Christmas Day. The monarch was pictured stepping out of a car before walking into church ahead of her grandchildren, Lady Louise Windsor and Viscount Severn. The palace said the duke went to hospital on the advice of his doctor. But it refused to confirm or deny reports the duke was flown to London by helicopter and then driven by car for the last part of the journey. The duke, who retired from official solo royal duties in 2017, walked into hospital and is expected to remain there for a few days. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
