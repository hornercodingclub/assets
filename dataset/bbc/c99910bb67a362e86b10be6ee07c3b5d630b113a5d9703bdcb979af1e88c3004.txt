He was then transferred to the Royal Stoke University Hospital, where he died on Thursday. Officers said the man and woman arrested on Friday were held in the Holyhead area. Det Ch Insp Brian Kearney, of North Wales Police, said: "Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the victim and we continue to request that their privacy is respected at this very tragic time. "We fully appreciate the shock this has caused with our community and we are continuing to appeal to anyone who has any information to come forward." Det Ch Insp Kearney said the man was attacked between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on Tuesday in the Thomas Street and Mount Pleasant area of Holyhead.
