Among his movie deals were $20m, also for Red Notice, and $20m for Six Underground, another Netflix film. Third on the list was actor and producer Mark Wahlberg, who earned $58m, while Ben Affleck came in fourth and Vin Diesel fifth. Indian actor Akshay Kumar was the only Bollywood star in the top 10.

Also on the list were Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, actors Will Smith and Adam Sandler, and veteran movie star Jackie Chan.
