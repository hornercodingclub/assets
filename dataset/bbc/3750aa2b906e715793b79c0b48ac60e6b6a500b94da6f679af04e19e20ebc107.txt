Rachel and Daniel Kensit, from Devon, had been due to get married near Bude, Cornwall, on New Year's Eve.

Under tier two in England, wedding and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions can take place with 15 people in attendance. However, receptions are not allowed in tier three. Mrs Kensit, from Bridgerule, near Holsworthy, said they had just spent six hours decorating the reception venue next to Poundstock church, where they were due to be married, "only to hear ... our reception would be unable to happen". She said she was initially "devastated" and considered having a reception first and the wedding the next day before deciding that "didn't feel right", and thinking: "Let's do the whole thing tonight." She said: "I phoned and asked the vicar, who immediately rushed to the church warden to see if this was a possibility. At 16:50 we had the go-ahead to have the ceremony at 18:15 that evening." "We frantically phoned around all our wedding party and workers, and every single person stepped up to the plate. "The caterers changed their plans to make it happen, the florist rushed around to sort the flowers, the photographer made it just in time. "We feel so blessed."
