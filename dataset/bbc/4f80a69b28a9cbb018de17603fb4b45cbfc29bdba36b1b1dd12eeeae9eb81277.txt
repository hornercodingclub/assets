And the Duchess of Sussex seemed to have taken the example to heart when she took on her husband Prince Harry in a netball shootout. Meghan was in stiletto heels for an awards ceremony at Loughborough University in Leicestershire - but still got stuck into a sports session. The royal couple were snapped laughing their way through the on-court contest. Meghan was joined by a roster of sports stars including tennis player Laura Robson, gymnastics coach Scott Hann, and England netballer Eboni Beckford-Chambers - an obvious advantage, you might think. Not to be outdone, Harry's team got a boost from ex-US basketball star David Robinson, as well as marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe, former England cricketer (and Strictly Come Dancing champion) Mark Ramprakash, and ex-England rugby player Ugo Monye. The Sussexes are clearly enjoying the masterclass with England netballer Eboni Beckford-Chambers! Harry and Meghan were at the university to present awards to graduates of Coach Core, an apprenticeship programme that trains unemployed young people to be sports coaches and mentors. It was founded through the Royal Foundation following the 2012 London Olympics. The Foundation was set up as a vehicle for Prince William and Prince Harry's charitable work in 2009. The Coach Core programme is set to double its reach over the next three years, adding 10 new sites thanks to a PS995,500 National Lottery grant. Harry's team ultimately won the netball skill test - but if Meghan wants a rematch, she needn't look far for a willing teammate. Her sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, is never one to dodge a sporting challenge - no matter how unorthodox her attire. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
