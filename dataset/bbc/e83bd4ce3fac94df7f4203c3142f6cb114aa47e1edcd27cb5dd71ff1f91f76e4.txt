Stables are currently closed to the public, leaving some horses without their usual level of exercise. Ingestre Stables has called for socially distanced tuition to be permitted to prevent the animals from physically deteriorating. Tim Downes, owner of the stables, said several older horses had died. He said: "We're already hearing from schools up and down the country that are losing some of their older horses from ailments that are brought on just by horses standing still and not getting worked." During previous lockdown restrictions, the issue had been "less severe" because horses can live in fields during spring and summer, and they require less food and exercise, the organisation said. In the winter, for many horses, it is necessary for them to be stabled, therefore requiring supplementary feeding and regular exercise. There was also the "welfare issue" of being able to raise enough money to feed the animals, he added. He said: "For many regular riders visiting their local riding school is critical to their mental wellbeing as well as being a recognised form of physical exercise." Former Olympic equestrian, Andrew Bennie, who works from the stables, said he believed socially distanced lessons could be achieved safely. "If there's the ability to open garden centres and businesses like that where people are close together surely they could look at what we're trying to do in places like this to keep our horses working and keep people exercised." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
