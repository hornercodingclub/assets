UK-based company Hopper HQ, which runs social media accounts on behalf of companies and individuals, published its first Instagram rich list in 2017. The rankings and cost per post were arrived at after speaking with so-called social media "influencers" themselves, along with brands and marketing companies, and using publicly available pricing information to estimate how much each account could charge.

Other than that, his promotional posts are largely for new episodes of The Titans, an NBC TV series which he hosts, or films in which he stars, such as upcoming DC Comics feature Black Adam. 1.
