The biggest fire is near Covilha, east of Tondela, Portugal's Jornal de Noticias website reports. Several suspected arsonists have been arrested. Firefighters spent the whole night battling another blaze, near the town of Vouzela. Portugal's Minister of Internal Administration, Miguel Macedo, pointed out the difficulty of fighting fires in thickly wooded hills. "Firefighters die because the conditions in which they are fighting the fires in these kinds of terrain are extraordinarily difficult," he said. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
