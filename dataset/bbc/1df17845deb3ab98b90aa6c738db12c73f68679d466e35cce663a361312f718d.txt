Two teenagers died at the Delny crossing near Barbaraville in Easter Ross in February 2007. Paul Oliver and Alan Thain, both 17, were passengers in a car which collided with a train. Network Rail's plans for the crossing have been recommended for approval by Highland Council officials. The local authority's north planning applications committee will consider the proposals at a meeting next week. Safety measures were previously added to the site, but Network Rail said it continued to present a "significant risk" to trains and people using the crossing. Since 2010, the company has been working through a programme of reducing risk at level crossings, including closing more than 1,000 sites. The Delny proposals form part of that work. Under the plans, the crossing would be closed and a section of new road built with a bridge taking it over the tracks. Richard Fleming, the teenage driver of the car in 2007's fatal crash, was given a five-year custodial sentence after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving. He later took part in a Network Rail film used to educate drivers of level crossing dangers. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
