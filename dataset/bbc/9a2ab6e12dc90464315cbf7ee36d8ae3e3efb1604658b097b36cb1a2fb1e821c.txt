Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant in Birmingham, said intensive care capacity in the city was full.

We are just about coping and that is thanks to lockdown and the good behaviour of the vast majority of people, but it's hard." Cabinet minister Michael Gove previously called the wider Midlands region "a particular area of concern", after a total of 212 deaths were reported there on Friday. The number of deaths covers those at the trust's four hospitals: the Queen Elizabeth, Good Hope, Heartlands and Solihull Hospital. The NEC hospital, with a 500-bed capacity, will have the ability to scale up to 4,000 beds if required. Dr David Rosser, chief executive of the trust, said: "The progress made on this site in just a few days, to turn it from a vast warehouse into an operational patient facility, is quite unbelievable. "At the same time we have continued to see and treat patients at our other four hospitals to ensure continuity of care across the system, despite the huge challenges."
