PC Tim Jones' videos and live shows on social media have brought him thousands of followers from all over the world. He was asked to record the charity single, Our Girl, by a friend who wrote it at his daughter's bedside while she was being treated in hospital. Proceeds from the song, to be released on Saturday, will go to Place 2 Be. Mr Jones began a challenge to sing one song a day for a month during lockdown. It was his rendition of Sweet Transvestite from The Rocky Horror Picture Show while dressed in police uniform that saw his videos take off. Our Girl was written by Robert Vestey, whose daughter Emilia, 15, suffers from stress-related seizures which have affected her school work and mental health. Mr Jones said: "It was emotional and I got choked when I first tried to sing it. I can relate to it massively as I have a daughter of a similar age. "He wrote it while Emilia was unconscious and he was sat beside her waiting for her to wake up. I found it a very moving song. "We feel this track resonates with not only children and students struggling during lockdown without friendships and routines, but also with families who have loved ones in hospital." The song has been recorded with Mr Vestey's band Brew 22, with all proceeds going to the Place 2 Be charity which offers counselling and wellbeing support. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
