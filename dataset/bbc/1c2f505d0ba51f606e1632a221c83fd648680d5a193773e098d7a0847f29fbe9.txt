Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: "Officers dealt with a significant number of calls to house gatherings over the weekend and we have been quite clear that we will enforce the law where necessary, as the public would expect us to do. "We are not just talking about large parties. The vast majority were smaller groups of different households meeting indoors. "House gatherings of any size cause the virus to spread and we are asking people to do the right thing and take personal responsibility."
