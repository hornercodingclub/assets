A 27-year-old man will appear on charges of grievous bodily harm and a 40-year-old woman has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Det Insp Rob Back said the charges followed a "painstaking nine-month police investigation" and detectives were "continuing to gather evidence" in preparation for trial.
