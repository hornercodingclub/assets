Jennifer Young told BBC News NI that the pair had always planned on a small wedding after getting engaged in July - but even those plans were cancelled due to coronavirus. Instead the couple decided they and their small number of guests would decamp to a cafe near Belfast City Hall for coffee and doughnuts - and that's when the magic happened. Buskers Mael Dee Dee and Isra Castro were playing on the street - and invited the couple to Stir It Up, via the Bob Marley track. "We were limited to the party being no more than 25 so we went in groups to get some coffee," Jennifer explained. "So we bumped into the buskers on the way to the coffee shop and basically were dared for this this be our first dance - and we thought why not!" After a dance and a doughnut, the happy couple walked to the Lagan footbridge for photos, the place where they were engaged in July.
