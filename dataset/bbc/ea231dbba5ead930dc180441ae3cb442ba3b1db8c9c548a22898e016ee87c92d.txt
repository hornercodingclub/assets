The material is classed as "exotics" and separate from tonnes of breeder material to be moved by rail from Dounreay to Sellafield later this year. , the NDA said the "exotics" could be moved in up to 60 journeys over six years starting sometime in 2014 or 2015. The mode of transport has not been determined at this stage. The NDA plans to make a decision on the material in March or April.

The authority added that it would take eight to 10 years to design and build the necessary facilities. Dounreay, an experimental nuclear power site, is being demolished and cleaned up.
