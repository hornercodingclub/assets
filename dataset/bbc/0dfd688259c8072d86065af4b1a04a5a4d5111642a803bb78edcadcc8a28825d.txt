The first phase of the 80 week project will see work undertaken to strengthen Pulrose Bridge in Douglas. The work is expected to take five weeks to complete before the main work on Peel Road begins in March. During the first phase of the PS4.3m project a one-way system into Douglas will be put in place between Quarterbridge and Pulrose Road. The section of road between Pulrose Road and Circular Road retain two way traffic. Director of highways Richard Pearson said the work was essential but meant more than a year of traffic disruption. He said: "The whole structure of Peel Road has failed which means it needs to be constructed from its foundations up. "This work needs to be done, it is currently one of the worst on the Isle of Man in terms of drive quality." The project, which is the biggest road improvement scheme on the Isle of Man since Richmond Hill in 2010, was approved in Tynwald last month. A spokesman for the Department of Infrastructure confirmed access to all businesses in the area would be maintained throughout. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
