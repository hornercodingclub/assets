During World War Two, it was home to 617 Squadron, which carried out the "bouncing bomb" attacks on German dams. The station - which is also the current home of the Red Arrows - is due to close in 2022, with the RAF display team moving to nearby RAF Waddington. Campaign group Save Scampton said it was vital to take action now. "It is our last and only chance to save Scampton and all it stands for," a spokeswoman said. The campaign group, which wants to run the site as a charitable trust, is currently drawing up a set of proposals to present to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). These include transforming it into a heritage centre and keeping the runway open to accommodate small aircraft. Proposals also include a hotel, provision for aircraft restoration and a retirement village for veterans. An MoD spokesperson said it "recognises that RAF Scampton is a site of historical significance and will look at options to provide a sustainable solution for preserving the story of the station after its closure." One part of the station's more dubious wartime history made news earlier this month. The 617 Squadron's mascot, a black Labrador, died on the day of the raids in 1943, and was buried on the site. However, the RAF recently because the dog's name was a racial slur and it "did not want to give prominence to an offensive term". A number of celebrities have also flown with the Red Arrows at Scampton, including Queen guitarist Brian May, who described it as "an amazing experience". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
