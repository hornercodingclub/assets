The Creative Youth Network charity will use the cash to revamp Bridewell Street magistrates' court and police station. Chief executive Sandy Hore-Ruthven said it would help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The project will cost PS6.5m, and a further PS1m needs to be raised before building work can begin. Mr Hore-Ruthven said: "This is a vision we've had for three years, and young people have been telling us for a long time that they have really struggled to get into the [creative industries]. The hub will rent out space to creative firms and ensure they in turn offer paid internships and recruit people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Trainee producer and musician Rory Joseph, 25, said: "The idea of a career in the creative industries is not taken seriously. "Extra support is needed so you can see the different opportunities and different routes on your career path." Mr Hore-Ruthven said: "It's a beautiful old Victorian magistrates' court that was built in 1860s. "It's got marbled columns, mosaic floors, beautifully wood panelled room and then the cells underneath as well. "There is a lot of work to do to bring the building back into life." The old magistrates court closed around 1974, and was then used as an overflow crown court. It remained in operation until the early 1990s, and was later closed and sold off.
