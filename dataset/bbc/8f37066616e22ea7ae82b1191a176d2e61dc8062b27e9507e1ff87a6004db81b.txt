The two Frenchmen, Pascal Fauret and Bruno Odos, were arrested and sentenced in the Caribbean nation but fled to the French Antilles while on bail. They were re-arrested after they reached the French mainland. Seven other defendants are also facing charges over the same case. They could face up to 30 years in jail if found guilty. The case, which was quickly dubbed "Air Cocaine", first hit the headlines in March 2013 when Dominican police opened the suitcases on board a Falcon jet in the resort town of Punta Cana to find them stuffed with 680kg (1,500lb) of cocaine. The plane bound for Saint-Tropez in the south of France was grounded and the two pilots and two passengers arrested. All four said they had had no idea the suitcases were filled with narcotics. But a Dominican judge ruled they were responsible for what was on board their plane and sentenced them to 20 years in jail. While under house arrest pending an appeal against their sentence, Fauret and Odos fled the Dominican Republic. They reportedly escaped with the help of former French intelligence agents who spirited them to the French Antilles aboard a boat and on to a flight to Paris. At the time of the arrest in France, their lawyer said the pilots had returned to France "not to flee justice but to seek justice". In 2015, a court in the Dominican Republic upheld the 20-year sentence for the two pilots and the two passengers in absentia. The trial is expected to take seven weeks. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
