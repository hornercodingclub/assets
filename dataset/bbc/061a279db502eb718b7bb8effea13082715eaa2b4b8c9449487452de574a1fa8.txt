The firm's Environmental Authorisation request has been denied by the prefect of Normandy, Pierre-Andre Durand. The company said the decision would not stop it from "securing the relevant French planning consents required" to build and run the power supply. to oppose the plans which would see the cable run through Portsmouth to a converter station in Lovedean. Campaigners said its installation would mean the loss of green spaces and wildlife habitats and would cause traffic disruption while it is built. Portsmouth City Council has also allocated PS250,000 to oppose the scheme.
