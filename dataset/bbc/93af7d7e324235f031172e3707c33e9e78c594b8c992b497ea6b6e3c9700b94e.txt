Eleven sites in Scotland will receive research and development money for schemes such as hydrogen power. The other six are based south of the border. The schemes include a hydrogen burner in South Uist, a high temperature heat store at a site in Aberdeen and a hot water recovery system in Glasgow. The successful distilleries will receive between PS44,000 and PS75,000 in the first phase of funding, with schemes including the use of hydrogen and biofuel boilers and geothermal energy in their production processes. The UK government said the funding would help distilleries cut emissions by almost a million tonnes of CO2 every year - equivalent to taking 200,000 cars off the road. UK Energy and Clean Growth Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said: "Every business can play a part in the green industrial revolution and this funding will allow UK distilleries to lead the way by making their production cleaner while also creating jobs." The announcement is part of the UK government's drive to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
