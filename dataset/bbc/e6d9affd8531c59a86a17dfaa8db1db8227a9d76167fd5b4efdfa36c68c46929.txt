There were three positive tests for Covid-19 and one suspected case found in Commodore Goodwill's crew. The Commodore Clipper, which normally carries freight and passengers from Portsmouth, will now be freight only. Passengers currently booked on the ship will be switched to high speed alternatives to and from Poole. The Goodwill carries freight between the islands, Portsmouth and St Malo. The changes mean freight services will involve no contact between anyone onboard and those at Guernsey, Jersey, Portsmouth and St Malo ports. Crew members affected on Commodore Goodwill were placed in isolation immediately and are well, Condor said. The entire crew is due to be replaced this weekend. Paul Luxon, Condor Ferries' CEO, said: "We take our obligations very seriously, so in line with our new policy that , we have heightened our safety protocols. "These changes have been endorsed by public health authorities and we can provide reassurance that the lifeline service into the islands will be maintained." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
