These are among the 200 images that best reflect the nation's lockdown, according to Historic England. More than 3,000 pictures were submitted by the public during a week-long appeal, with . Ten contemporary artists have also entered pictures into the archive as well as choosing favourites from the public submissions. Historic England said the call-out was the first time the public had been asked to capture photographs for the archive since World War Two. "The fascinating response to our Picturing Lockdown call-out sheds light on our collective and individual experiences of lockdown and provide a snapshot into this unusual time that will be accessible for future generations to see and learn from," Claudia Kenyatta, director of regions, said.
