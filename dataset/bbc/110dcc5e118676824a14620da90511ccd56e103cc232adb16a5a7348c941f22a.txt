Great Central Railway, in Leicestershire, had sought PS250,000 to mitigate the effects of coronavirus. Managing director Michael Gough said: "We stand to lose more than PS2m this year - this funding was about paying wages and vital maintenance." A Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) spokesperson said the bid was "outside the scope" of their support. The line is known for its double track, which means it is one of the only UK heritage attractions where steam trains can pass each other. The National Lottery Heritage Emergency Fund was set up to give grants of up to PS250,000 to help organisations affected by Covid-19. Mr Gough said they had already lost PS1m during lockdown and would lose at least another PS1m due to reduced capacity and cancelled events. "There are lots of projects that now just won't happen," he said. "We were confident of getting this grant, we put in a good application, so it's a bitter blow to be turned down." The HLF said in a statement: "We were unable to support the application as it focused on costs for capital works, which were outside the scope of the programme, rather than emergency or stabilising costs. "We understand this is disappointing news." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
