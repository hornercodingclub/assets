The letters were addressed to Mrs Mary Fortune from her husband George, a Durham Light Infantry private from West Hartlepool who was killed in action aged 27. They were found in a sewing box that had been donated to the Sue Ryder shop in Fulwell, Sunderland. The shop is hoping to return the letters to relatives of Mrs Fortune. "The letters are an important part of history that brings home the sacrifices our soldiers made during World War One," shop supervisor Cathy Duncan said.
