A campaign group has already applied Work on the project is set to start in 2023 and take five years to complete. Mr Shapps' decided to proceed with it But Mr Whitehead said he saw it as a solution to "horrendous" traffic in villages on and around the A303. Wiltshire Council's cabinet officially gave its support for the plan at a virtual meeting on Tuesday. Other work will include a bypass to the north of Winterbourne Stoke with a viaduct over the River Till valley. A junction with the A360 to the west of- and outside the Stonehenge World Heritage Site - will also be built. The A303 would pass underneath that junction. The current road passing through the World Heritage Site would become a walking, cycling and horse riding route, Highways England said. The National Trust, English Heritage and Historic England are all in favour of the plan. But the Save Stonehenge World Heritage Site (SSWHS) group said it worries that the two-mile (3.2km) tunnel would be "wasteful and destructive" and on the wider area. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
