The bodies of Dainius Kulboka, 44, and Jonas Semenas, 45, were found in Ilford, east London, on Sunday morning. Vytautas Garmus, also known as Vepkhvia Laliashuilia, has been charged with both murders and appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday. The 48-year-old was remanded in custody ahead of the next hearing on 9 April at the same court. Mr Garmus, who is from Georgia, was assisted by a Russian interpreter as he confirmed his name and date of birth. Prosecutor James Dawes said the killings were carried out in the "most brutal fashion". One victim suffered 52 stab wounds and the other had nine, the court was told. Mr Kulboka and Mr Semenas, both Lithuanian nationals, were pronounced dead at the scene. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
