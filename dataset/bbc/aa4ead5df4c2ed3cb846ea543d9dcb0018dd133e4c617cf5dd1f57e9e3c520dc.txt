The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said it has received reports in connection with the deaths at Aberdeen's Rubislaw Park care home. A total of 27 other deaths are already being investigated at two other facilities in the north east of Scotland. There have been 15 deaths at Deeside Care Home in Cults, and 12 deaths at Inchmarlo House near Banchory. COPFS has established a dedicated Covid-19 Deaths Investigation Team (CDIT) to look at the circumstances of outbreaks. COPFS said in a statement: "The procurator fiscal has received reports in connection with the deaths of 11 people at Rubislaw Park Care Home, Aberdeen. "The investigation into the deaths is ongoing and the families will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments." Privately-run Rubislaw Park has been approached for comment. Care and support during the pandemic was rated "weak" at Deeside Care Home and Inchmarlo House in a Care Inspectorate report last week. Meanwhile the outbreak at Inchmarlo has been declared over, according to Aberdeenshire Health and Social Care Partnership. It said there were 108 cases associated with the outbreak. A spokesman for the home said it continued to work with and receive support from the health and social care partnership "during these difficult times". The spokesman added: "The Care Inspectorate revisited us last week and we are extremely pleased with their initial feedback that reflects the hard work and commitment of the Inchmarlo House Care Home team who are now back at work." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
