A police inquiry is under way after Race Council Cymru (RCC) tweeted shots of the wreaths that were moved in Cardiff and put on top of a bin. RCC said: "We are shocked, horrified and distressed." South Wales Police Inspector Kevin Jones said the act was being treated as a "hate-related incident". "Our Commonwealth veterans who we honour should be respected and this is not respect," RCC said. The plaque, which the wreaths surrounded, was in Cardiff in 2019. Joanne Maksymiuk-King, Partnership & Hate Crime Community Support Officer for RCC, said: "For the community, it is distressing that this happened. "We are trying to remain positive. As an organisation, we are appealing for anyone who might have information to speak to the police or us." We are shocked, horrified & distressed that our tributes to Ethnic Minority Servicemen and Women were picked up by someone and placed on the bin! Our Commonwealth veterans who we honour should be respected and this is not respect! /s ?
