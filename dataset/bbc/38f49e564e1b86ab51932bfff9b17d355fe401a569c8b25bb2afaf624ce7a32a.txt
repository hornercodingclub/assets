Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the money would help businesses such as gyms and retailers. The Scottish government money is in addition to a PS570m support package made available in November. Similar grant schemes are in place for businesses affected by the pandemic in Northern Ireland, England and Wales. Firms that have been forced to close their doors because of the restrictions are currently able to apply for a support grant of up to PS3,000 for every four weeks the measures are in place. Non-essential retail and gyms will now be given up to an additional PS3,000 under the new scheme. Opposition parties had warned the latest lockdown measures for some if support was not delivered faster, with the Scottish Conservatives warning that many small firms were "close to broke". Ms Forbes said that "work is already under way to ensure businesses get support as quickly as possible". She added: "On top of the additional PS570m package of support announced at the start of this month, these changes will manage that increased demand, accelerating the grant application process and in turn getting these essential payments to businesses as quickly as possible." The grants will be paid by Scotland's local councils. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
