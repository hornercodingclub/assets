The students were fined after a party at Lafrowda halls of residence on Saturday, said police. The university called it "unacceptable behaviour" and has launched its own investigation. "The health and safety of our whole community must come first and we will take action on any individuals breaking Covid-19 rules," it said. Devon and Cornwall Police said when they arrived at the halls of residence "the reported gathering had largely dispersed", but officers spoke to a number of students and the university's security patrol. "We have since reviewed body-worn video and liaised with the university on this matter and at this time we have issued PS200 fixed penalty notices to three students," the force said. The fines were among 38 fixed penalties for Covid breaches issued by the force between 5 and 10 January. Officers said the fines included nine for outdoor gatherings, four for leaving the house without reasonable excuse and 15 for indoor gatherings. It had received about 885 reports of breaches in the same time span, of which 699 were dealt with without fines. "Enforcement is used as a last resort," said the force. "Devon and Cornwall Police operate over the largest geographical force in the country and we cannot be everywhere at once, so it is vital that all are doing their part in adhering to the rules of lockdown as this will ultimately save lives," it added.
