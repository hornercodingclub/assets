The virus accounted for 27.4% of all registered deaths in December, a higher proportion than in England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Based on provisional data, Covid was the leading cause of death for 2020. The mortality rate rose "significantly" for a third month, to 374.4 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales. Figures for December showed it was at the highest rate since the peak in April. It is also higher than any region of England, where Yorkshire and the Humber had the highest mortality rate (320.5 deaths per 100,000). The English average was 233.6. It was also more than twice the rate - on an age-standardised count - in the most deprived areas when compared with the least deprived areas. ONS analysis of death registrations points to Covid-19 being the underlying cause of death in 12.5% of all deaths - 4,532 - in Wales. It was the underlying cause in 12.9% of deaths in England. In Wales, the provisional number of deaths from all causes registered in December was 3,941 - 1,075 more than the five-year average for the month. The 56 Covid deaths on 18 December was the highest on a single day in Wales since 17 April when there were 58, said the ONS. The mortality rate is also higher than each of the past nine years in Wales. Leading causes of death, following Covid-19, were dementia and Alzheimer's disease, then heart disease. For 2020 deaths registered by 9 January 2021, there were 2,794 more deaths than the five-year average (8.3% higher). The figures released include a breakdown of where the deaths of people with Covid-19 have happened in Wales, including at a localised level. Two of the highest, when these are converted into crude mortality rates based on population size, are both in Rhondda Cynon Taf  (RCT): Tonyrefail West (53 deaths, which is 515.7 deaths per 100,000) and Penrhiwceiber, where there have been 26 deaths and a mortality rate of 436.9. Brynmawr in Blaenau Gwent, Port Talbot East (Neath Port Talbot) and Porth East and Ynsyhit (RCT) are also in the highest five.
