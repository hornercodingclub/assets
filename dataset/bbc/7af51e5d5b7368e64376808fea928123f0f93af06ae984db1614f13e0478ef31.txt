There were 35 confirmed cases of coronavirus amongst 500 workers at the Cranswick Country Foods plant in Cullybackey last August. It forced a two-week closure of the the plant. The factory processes about 10,000 animals a week. It meant some farmers had to hold onto animals, incurring additional cost and leaving some outside factory specification, resulting in price penalties. The market for pork in China was also temporarily lost. The scheme will open for applications next month with a total fund of PS2.2m. Stormont Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said it was the latest sector to benefit from Covid-19 support. He added: "This financial support will address the effects of the temporary loss of the lucrative Chinese export market, additional penalties on overweight and overfat pigs, and the price impact of alternative pig marketing arrangements." More than 11,300 farmers and growers have now shared PS19m in compensation from the Stormont executive after the closure of markets and other disruption caused by the lockdown. Cranswick Country Foods was the first processing business to close because of Covid-19 but a number of others have been affected by staff outbreaks. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
