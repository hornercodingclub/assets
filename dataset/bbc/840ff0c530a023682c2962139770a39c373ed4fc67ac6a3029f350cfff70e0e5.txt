She said 388 staff affected by the closures would be offered "alternative work options" to minimise redundancies. Chief operating officer Jonathon Woodall said the "first priority" was to "look after our customers" and ensure "the highest standards of customer service". He added that the firm was "continuing with our robust two-year business plan and continue to be ready for the bounce back when it comes". Dame Irene Hays, owner and chair of the Sunderland-based firm, said it was "always our intention to review the performance of our shops at the end of the licence period".

Options for staff include working from home or filling vacancies in other shops. The spokeswoman said the firm employed about 7,700 people, many of whom were "working from home taking bookings for holidays for 2021 and beyond".
