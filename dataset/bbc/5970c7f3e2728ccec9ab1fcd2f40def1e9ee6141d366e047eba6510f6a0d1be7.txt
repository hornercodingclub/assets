The stencilled design depicts a child carrying a wooden sword with a pencil attached to the end, next to the text "Draw the raised bridge!" The council has confirmed the mural is to stay in situ and be protected. The work on Scott Street bridge, Wincolmlee, Jason Fanthorpe, the cleaner, and a number of other helpers used water and white spirit to partly restore the image. Because of the whitewash the council has since installed a protective cover over the work. A new, more permanent cover is to be installed to protect the mural and make the most of it in the future, the council added. A steady stream of people have been visiting the riverside street to take photos of the mural after images of it were shared on Banksy's Instagram account. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz previously described Banksy as a "good artist and a genius PR man". "I don't think you can remove it," he said. "I think the whole point of Banksy's work is they are what is called site specific... they work because of the places they've been put and if you remove the location the work loses its power." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
