Alexia Walenkaki was visiting Mile End Park in east London as an early birthday treat with friends on Friday 17 July when a tree trunk collapsed. She had been playing on a rope-swing which ran from the trunk to the frame of a zip wire, police said. Post-mortem tests on Wednesday gave the cause of death as severe head injuries. Alexia's mother Vida Kwotuah said she watched in horror as the tree trunk knocked her daughter to the ground. The Metropolitan Police and the Health and Safety Executive are jointly investigating the death and the playground remains closed. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
