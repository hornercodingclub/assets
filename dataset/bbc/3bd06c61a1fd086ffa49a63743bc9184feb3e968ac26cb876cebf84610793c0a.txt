Norwich's Northern Distributor Road was closed so that the Avro RJ85 could be lifted into place at the City of Norwich Aviation Museum on Friday. The plane, donated by City Jet, will serve as an example of the BAe 146 series that has used Norwich Airport since 1983. The aircraft was popular as it was less noisy than other jets, the museum said. "Its quiet operation has been the key to its success," a spokesman said. The RJ85 will be on display at the museum alongside other commercial aircraft, such as the Handley Page Herald and the Fokker Friendship. City Jet, the last operator of this particular RJ85 aircraft, has a long association with Norwich Airport. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
