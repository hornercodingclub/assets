On Saturday the province imposed a nightly curfew between 20:00 and 05:00. Walking a dog close to home is one of the only acceptable reasons to be outside between those times. The pair were spotted by police at around 21:00 on Saturday, just a short while after the new rules came into effect. They reportedly told police that they were following the rule for pets.
