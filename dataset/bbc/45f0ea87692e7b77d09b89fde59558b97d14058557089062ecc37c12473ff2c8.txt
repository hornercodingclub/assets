The historic ship and the two landmark buildings have made the shortlist for a museums-led arts project. Sam Bompas and Harry Parr, who are described as "food architects", will make a replica of the winner in jelly during a weekend of events in May. The dome of the Dounreay Fast Reactor has previously been made into art. Artist Kate William created a glass sculpture of the sphere-shaped DFR which glows bright green under certain conditions. The artwork can be lit by using ultraviolet light to stimulate particles of uranium dioxide inside it. Thurso museum Caithness Horizons put the DFR forward for the jelly competition, which forms part of this year's Museums at Night celebrations. Held annually, Museums at Night involves hundreds of museums, galleries, libraries, archives and heritage sites across the UK opening their doors for special evening events. People have been invited to vote for which landmark they would like to see recreated in jelly by Bompas and Parr. The London-based pair's previous work has included a replica of St Paul's Cathedral. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
