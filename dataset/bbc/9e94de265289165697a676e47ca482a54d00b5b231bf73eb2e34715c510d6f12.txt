The virus accounted for 21.6% of all registered deaths, a higher proportion than in England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Covid had last been the leading cause of death in both April and May before dropping back. The mortality rate rose "significantly" for a second month, to 260 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales. It was also more than twice the rate in the most deprived areas compared with the least deprived areas. Over the summer, Covid-19 fell back significantly as a cause of death, but was back to being the third leading cause of death in October, behind dementia and heart disease. It has now overtaken those causes. The age-adjusted mortality rate in Wales for deaths is above that in England, where it is 191.3 deaths per 100,000 people, for a second month in succession. But it is still below the peak in April, when it was more than 495 deaths per 100,000.
