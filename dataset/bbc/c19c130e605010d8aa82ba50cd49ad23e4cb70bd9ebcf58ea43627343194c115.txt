The cantilever clock, on the corner of Princes Street and Hope Street, became a well-known landmark after being added to what was Binns department store. However, its painted pipers that once marched on the hour and half hour fell silent after the clock fell into disrepair. The project is part of plans to create a visitor attraction at the site. Drinks giant Diageo is in the process of transforming the former House of Fraser store, which shut last year, . They said the clock would be "brought back to life" by expert clockmakers who had been commissioned to restore it to its original glory. Known locally as the "Binns Clock" after the former department store, the clock was first installed in 1960 and became a popular meeting place for Edinburgh residents, particularly as a romantic rendezvous point for people going on dates. Mark Crangel, the clockmaker from Cumbria Clock Company who is overseeing the restoration, said: "It's great to be working on this clock because it is such a well-known landmark in Edinburgh. "It's not worked for a while now and with a lot of moving parts, so it will be a demanding job but it will be incredibly satisfying to see the clock working again as it did when it was first installed 60 years ago." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
