Andre Oliveira Macedo, also known as Andre do Rap, was released from a high security prison on Saturday - but this decision was revoked just hours later. He has been missing since. Macedo is a senior member of the Sao Paulo-based First Command of the Capital (PCC) gang, which holds power in jails across Brazil and Paraguay and smuggles tonnes of cocaine into Europe. His release was the result of a controversial order by Judge Marco Aurelio Mello, one of 11 justices on Brazil's Supreme Court. Judge Mello granted Macedo's release from the Sao Paulo prison on the grounds that the amount of time he had spent in detention awaiting trial had exceeded the legal maximum. He was arrested in September 2019, and had been detained since. After his release, Macedo was ordered to go into house arrest. The order to release him was controversial. Sao Paulo state governor Joao Doria called it "an unacceptable condescension to criminals". Within a few hours, High Court president Luiz Fux had suspended the decision and ordered Macedo to be re-arrested and returned to prison immediately. However, by this time he was already gone - with some local reports suggesting he fled the country. Investigators in Sao Paulo have not provided details on the search. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
