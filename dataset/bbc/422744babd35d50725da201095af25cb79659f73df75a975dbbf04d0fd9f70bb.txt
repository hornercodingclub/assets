The panel's creation was approved unanimously as States members agreed to adopt the island's Carbon Neutral Strategy. A group of 49 randomly selected citizens will make up the assembly, which will then report to the States of Jersey. The government's strategy aims to make the island carbon neutral by 2030. The citizens assembly is due to begin work in April and will produce its first set of recommendations, assisted by experts, to the States in July. Selected islanders will be invited to join the assembly, but can refuse the invitation if they wish. The assembly forms part of the government's "people-powered approach" outlined in its strategy, which includes: Jersey's Minister for the Environment, John Young, must now produce a "long-term climate action plan" by the end of 2020. An island-wide consultation will be held to discuss his proposals, before its debate in the States Assembly. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
