The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said the warning was in place across the country until Friday. Temperatures are expected to rise above 20C during the week. The warning follows wildfires in April, . Burning for several days near Paul's Hill wind farm at Knockando, south west of Elgin, it destroyed more than 20 square miles of grassland. Dry conditions and high winds caused the flames to spread aggressively and at its height 80 firefighters were tackling the blaze. Last month also saw a large wildfire spread rapidly across five square miles of forestry in Skye. At its height, about 40 firefighters and eight fire appliances were in attendance at the incident at Edinbane wind farm near Struan. Firefighters said the incident was notable because of the "incredible speed" that the wildfire travelled at, fanned by wind in dry conditions.
