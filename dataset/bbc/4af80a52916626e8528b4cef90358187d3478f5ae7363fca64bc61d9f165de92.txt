The piece is the missing third act of an opera that recounts the story of nurse Edith Cavell, from Norfolk. Miss Cavell is credited with helping 200 British soldiers escape occupied Belgium during World War One. She was arrested for treason - and executed by a German firing squad in 1915. The three-act opera was written by Maltese composer Paolino Vassallo (1856-1923) and performed in Malta in 1927. The Norfolk Record Office (NRO) already holds the first two acts in leather-bound manuscripts after it acquired them at auction in 1941. Staff are appealing for help in finding the third act after a request from a student researching Vassallo's work in Malta. Nick Miller, keeper of the Cavell memorabilia, described it as a "wide search for a needle in a haystack". "We're asking older libraries, anyone with collections to have a look, it could be buried somewhere on a shelf," he said. "It is an extraordinary document. The composer's handwriting is all over the first two acts in four colours of ink - so there's no reason the third act won't be the same." Mr Miller added: "We want people to know what a courageous and extraordinary woman she was. "Her faith through her upbringing is the core of what motivated her." Norfolk county archivist Gary Tuson said Edith Cavell's life story is not complete without the third act. "It is the real emotional centrepiece of Cavell's life, charting her execution and death, the tragic end," he said. "It may not even exist anymore. If we're not successful then it may be a good opportunity for someone to complete her story and write it." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
