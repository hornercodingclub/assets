The 14-year-old victim was stabbed at a bus stop on Tamworth Road, Sawley, Derbyshire, on 11 November. Derby Crown Court heard the boy suffered injuries including a lacerated liver and collapsed lung and has since been discharged from hospital. Two boys, both 15, have been sentenced over the attack. The pair - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - were sentenced to two-and-a-half years each in a juvenile facility. The court heard on the afternoon of the stabbing, the victim was approached by a group of four boys. One of the attackers, named as boy A, pulled out a knife and stabbed him. The victim then ran around the bus before another attacker, boy B, "lunged towards [the victim] with his knife", prosecutor Laura Pitman said. CCTV footage from the moving bus showed the boy run around the double-decker and follow it up the road, before eventually being able to get on. He then collapsed on to the floor of the bus in front of passengers and shouted: "I have been stabbed." In total, he was stabbed three times. One of the attackers had previously had a fight with the victim, the court was told. Only two of his attackers were ever identified, both of whom pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm and having an offensive weapon. A restraining order has also been put in place, which prohibits the attackers from contacting the victim for five years. Recorder William Harbage QC said: "This attack was sustained as [the victim] ran around the bus. "Had you been adults, had you both been 10 years older, you would both be looking at a starting point of 10 years in prison. "Knife crime is a plague on society at the moment. People must understand that if they behave in the way you have done, serious sentences of detention will follow."
