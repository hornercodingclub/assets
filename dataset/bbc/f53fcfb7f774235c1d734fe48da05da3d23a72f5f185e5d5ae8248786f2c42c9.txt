Staff already routinely trace contacts of people diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections. Clinical director Dr Susanna Currie said they used their expertise to "assist the local effort to reduce the effect of COVID-19 in our region". "We have fantastic communication skills well suited to conducting sensitive and detailed summaries to ascertain the adequate details for all those in close contact with someone who has tested positive," she said.

Staff have also helped arrange tests for those contacts who themselves developed symptoms.
