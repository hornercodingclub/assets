Orfordness Lighthouse Trust plans to recreate the top third of the 1792 structure as a permanent tribute at a safe distance from the sea. The lantern room, weighing nearly eight tonnes, is the second section of the lighthouse, designed by architect William Wilkins, to have been craned 30m (98ft) to the ground.
