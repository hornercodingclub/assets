Government departments, arms-length groups and not-for-profit organisations will be able to bid for up to PS5m of funding per project. Treasury Minister Susie Pinel said it aimed to trigger a "quick recovery" for the island economy. All 47 members of the States Assembly at the meeting voted in favour of the plan. The money will be used to fund short-term projects that can be completed by December 2021, Deputy Pinel announced. The first PS25m will be put towards projects from November, with the remaining money reserved for those starting from February. A maximum of PS5m will be issued per application, and will not have to be paid back. The stimulus package is in addition to PS50m for "key infrastructure" investment announced by the government in July. Applicants for the latest support will be required to submit a report on how their plans will contribute to the island's economy, including the age and gender of those most likely to benefit. This information will be made publicly available, following an amendment to the proposition by Deputy Kirsten Morel. The latest forecast from the Fiscal Policy Panel showed the level of Gross Value Added (GVA) in Jersey was 6% lower than predicted before the pandemic. Mrs Pinel said the PS50m would be issued "on a timely and temporary basis" and targeted towards projects "that would support local employment and local business". She added: "Jersey is a place of ideas and energy, and I feel confident that we will receive a range of projects that can benefit the island in a quick recovery." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
