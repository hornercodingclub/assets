Gloucestershire Warwickshire Steam Railway (GWSR) currently runs between Cheltenham and Laverton but wants to extend to Broadway in Worcestershire. A public share scheme raised more than PS500,000 in 2014 and GWSR said "over PS35,000 per day" was coming in. It is hoped funding will enable the opening of a station in Broadway in 2018. Ian Crowder, from GWSR, said money was "coming in at an unprecedented rate". He said investments had come from a "mixture of supporters and local people as well as railway enthusiasts". "We've come to the end of the era of the trainspotter image, this is a serious business and a significant contributor to the tourist economy of the Cotswolds," Mr Crowder said. The public share offer - called "Broadway: The Last Mile" - aims to raise funds to buy rail and ballast, complete civil engineering works, and install the infrastructure. It would enable trains to be run into Broadway for the "first time in more than half a century". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
