Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi in Holyhead, a 1,300-pupil secondary, and primaries Ysgol Gymraeg Morswyn in Holyhead and Ysgol y Ffridd in Gwalchmai have shut. Adam Rhys Williams, Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi head teacher, said the decision came after "several positive cases within the school community". The council said it was supporting the schools to implement home learning. In a letter to parents on social media, Mr Williams said closing the school was the best thing "to protect everyone". He added the school would have to close until Friday, and a number of staff would have to self-isolate. "Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi cannot operate a full school curriculum safely with children at school for the remainder of the week," he said. Mr Williams said the school was working closely with the council's environmental health team and contact tracers to monitor the situation. Lessons will be moved online, with pupils expected to stick to their normal class timetable.
