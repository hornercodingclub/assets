The Dorset Knob Throwing and Frome Valley Food Festival features a competition to hurl the county's traditional biscuits as far as possible. Ian Gregory, chair of the Dorset Knob Throwing Committee, said it had been affected by Covid-19 restrictions. The event is scheduled to return to Cattistock in May 2022. It incorporates a food festival, live music and knob-based games such as knob-and-spoon racing, splat the knob, knob darts, and pin the knob on the Cerne Abbas giant. Players also battle to eat as many knobs as possible in record time. The one-day festival attracted 8,000 revellers in 2019, and knob-throwing has taken place there since 2008. Experienced and hardened contestants are seen tossing their knobs underarm while keeping one foot on the ground during each bash. Mr Gregory said the decision to cancel "was reluctantly made due to current Covid-19 restrictions and their anticipated continuation". He added: "The committee took the view that to continue in these circumstances could put people's lives at risk and felt that they had a duty of care towards all visitors, volunteers and stallholders." He said the "essence and joy" of throwing knobs was that it was "great fun" and "without the freedom to mix openly the spontaneity and appeal of this event will be lost". He described the practice as a "zany, quintessentially British event which has caught the public imagination". The festival was cancelled in 2020 , but Mr Gregory said organisers were working to "ensure a successful and reinvigorated" return next year. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
