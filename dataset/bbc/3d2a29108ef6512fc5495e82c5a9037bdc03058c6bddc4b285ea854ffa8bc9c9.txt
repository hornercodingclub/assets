Rather than face one long closure, Barmouth Viaduct will close three times for short periods. The entire length of track on the structure will be replaced, along with a large number of the timber and metal elements. Built in 1864 and 2,690ft (820m) long, Network Rail says Barmouth is its only major timber-built bridge still in use. The viaduct, on the Cambrian coast rail line between Pwllheli and Machynlleth, was originally built with a drawbridge which was replaced with a steel swing-bridge in 1900. Bill Kelly of Network Rail said it would be the bridge's biggest upgrade in its history, adding: "Barmouth Viaduct is one of the most celebrated and recognisable structures in Wales." It will shut from 23:40 BST on Friday until 05:30 on 2 November. Further closures will follow in 2021 and 2022.
