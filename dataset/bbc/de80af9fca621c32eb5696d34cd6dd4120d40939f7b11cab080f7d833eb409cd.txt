The has helped more than 200 farmers and their families since launching in west Wales five years ago. Now it has expanded its service to Gwynedd, Conwy and Anglesey, with plans to cover the entire country. However the charity said it is concerned that many farmers may be reluctant to ask for help. Project leader Elen Skyrme said farmers across the region revealed worries over money, mental health, rural crime and poor internet and mobile signal, were the most common. "What is clear is that farmers aren't struggling with a single issue but combinations of several problems, one on top of the other." The scheme will appoint "rural-life advisors" in every diocese to help those struggling with countryside life. However, it faces the challenge of convincing farmers in need of help to use it. "The problems farmers are struggling with makes depressing reading but our concern is that many farmers have told us they wouldn't seek help for fear of embarrassment, shame or other concerns over confidentiality is awful," said Tir Dewi chief executive Gareth Davies. "Farmers and their families need to know that all our help is confidential and we will never judge." Delyth Owen, leading the service in Anglesey, added: "We know making the call can be difficult, but talking is the first step towards finding a solution." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
