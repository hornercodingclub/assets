The youngsters were washed on to beaches in Wales after being battered by the storm. They were taken to the RSPCA's West Hatch centre in Somerset and will be returned to the wild later. The centre said the pups would use the paddling pools inside before being transferred to a larger outdoor area. Centre manager Dr Bel Deering said stormy weather could cause problems for the seal colonies at this time of year because the pups are still very young and vulnerable, and they can easily become separated from their mothers. "Caring for young seal pups can be very tricky and time-consuming for the team as we have to tube-feed them fish soup before they move on to eating fish themselves," Dr Deering added. The three pups have been named Chicory, Basil and Fennel by the centre staff. The RSPCA said people should not approach seal pups they come across but instead monitor them from a safe distance for a 24-hour period, to see if the mother returns. If the mother does not return, then a trained rescue team should be contacted.
