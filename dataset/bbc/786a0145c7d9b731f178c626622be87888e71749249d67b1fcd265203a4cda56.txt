Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengelly added the revelations raised the importance of staff feeling they can be open about workplace incidents. He made the comments as he provided a progress report on recommendations from the Hyponatraemia Inquiry report. Mr Pengelly said he recognised that there is a desire to see progress with implementing the recommendations. "The recommendations of the Hyponatraemia Inquiry potentially impact on every service provided by our health and social care system and on every service user, carer and their families as well as on every member of staff employed to provide health and social care services," he said. The issues raised in the inquiry are being addressed through a system-wide approach co-produced by people who provide and receive health and social care services. The permanent secretary said there are a number of recommendations which will require ministerial and executive approval, including those which require legislation. He said "despite the political situation, work is proceeding against all of the recommendations".
