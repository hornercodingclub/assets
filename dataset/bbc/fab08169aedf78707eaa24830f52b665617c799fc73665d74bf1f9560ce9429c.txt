The Policy and Resources Committee said it was "not appropriate" to increase pay for political members "at a time when public finances are under enormous pressure". An increase for all members was due to be automatically applied from May. Deputy Peter Ferbrache said: "We all need to do what we can to preserve our limited public finances." The Policy and Resources Committee (P&R) said the fact many employees in the public and private sectors will see their salaries frozen influenced its decision. Mr Ferbrache, president of the committee, added: "In these extraordinary times, I'm sure all my political colleagues will be in full agreement that deputies' pay should not be increased this year." States deputies currently receive PS40,521, with committee presidents and members of P&R PS54,744 and the president of P&R PS71,248. However, members who are over the pension age, currently 65 and four months, are paid less because they are not paid a top up covering social insurance contributions - deductions of PS1,708 for deputies, PS2,307 for committee presidents and P&R members, and PS3,003 for P&R president.
