Concerns were raised by the party after a banner mocking the death of veteran republican Bobby Storey was erected near the site. and treating it as "hate motivated". There are plans for a new PS18m crematorium to be built on the site. Sinn Fein has been granted an equality impact assessment on the proposal. On Friday, Sinn Fein told a council committee of their concerns over the banner being put up at the cemetery earlier this month, on the outskirts of east Belfast. Councillor Ronan McLaughlin said that he and party colleagues have been contacted by families of recently-deceased people who are "concerned about Roselawn". "There is a perception within the Catholic, nationalist and republican community that Roselawn is not a welcome place for them," Mr McLaughlin said. The Alliance Party and the DUP both said they believed it was an "isolated incident". But all parties agreed that plans for the new Roselawn crematorium should now be subject to an equality impact assessment. Sinn Fein said it is not against the building of the new crematorium, but want to make sure everyone will feel welcome there. The DUP leader on the council, George Dorrian, said the recent banner was "reprehensible" but did not think it was part of a "wider problem". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
