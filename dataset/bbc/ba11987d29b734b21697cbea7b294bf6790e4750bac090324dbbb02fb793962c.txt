One friend described Mr Clark as "a sound lad" who "always had time for a chat with anyone". Another said: "Always a laugh and always there to chat... top lad, will be missed." said the avalanche occurred outside the piste between the Verbier ski area and Les Attelas. "At around 10.20am, a skier was driving down a corridor below the Attelas area," it said. "A snow drift came loose and carried the skier as well as another person who had been further down at the time." A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesman said: "We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in the Swiss Alps, and are in contact with the authorities in Switzerland.
