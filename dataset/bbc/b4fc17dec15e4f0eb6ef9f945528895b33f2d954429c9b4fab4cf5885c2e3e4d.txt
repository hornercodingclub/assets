The vehicle knocked through the shop's front wall, and causing extensive damage inside on Saturday morning. Carmel Dooley, from Mane Attraction Unisex Hair Salon, said it was "the last thing" the business needed. She said the business had been closed for the past 10 weeks due to Covid-19 restrictions. Ms Dooley estimated about PS10,000 of damage had been caused by the crash to the premises on Killeavy Road. "We are overwhelmed by the support from the local community, councillors and the business owners in Whitegates today and we'll hopefully be back on our feet again for when the restrictions ease," Ms Dooley told BBC News NI. She added that she wished to also extend her thanks to the PSNI, who had assisted her following the crash. The PSNI said there was a "potential link" between the incident and a "creeper style burglary and criminal damage" which happened at about 04:45 in Clanrye Park. Two sets of keys and a red Audi A3, which was parked in the area, were taken during the incident. Shortly after 05:00 GMT the vehicle was found on fire at the Killeavey Road and Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) was called. A PSNI spokesman said: "Enquiries are continuing and we are investigating a potential link between these incidents and a report of criminal damage which occurred at the Killeavey Road area of Newry. "It is believed the shutters of the property had been rammed by a vehicle during the incident. At this stage, it is not believed that entry was gained to the property." Police are appealing for anyone with information or who saw anything suspicious in the area, to contact them on 101 quoting reference number 341. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
