Derbyshire Police has launched an appeal to find the owners of the photo which was discovered by police in Vaslui two weeks ago. Jewellery, silverware, and watches were also found in the raid, alongside a personal handwritten note which could help identify the owners. The force said a "potential victim" had come forward in response to the appeal. Det Sgt Stuart Kershaw, from Derbyshire Police's international liaison office, said officers believe the items "originate from the UK". The picture is of a woman and two children, while the note is dated 18 July 1995 to someone called Richard and says: "To wake you up and so come home safely, love Mum and Dad. "The Global Virgin Challenge." Det Sgt Tom Grundey, from the Opal serious organised crime team, said: "Often items stolen during burglaries are worth more in memories than in their monetary value - and I am sure this is the case with these two items. "Our hope is that, with the public's help, we can find the owners of these two items and begin to understand where other victims may be located." The suspected Romanian burglary gang are thought to have been active in the UK, especially in the Midlands, and other parts of Western Europe. eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
