The research is being conducted by the National Centre for Social Research on behalf of the Alcohol Advisory Service. The postal survey will also include information on how to get help for anyone whose life has been affected. The move comes after the launch of GamCare Isle of Man in November, an organisation set up to provide support for problem gamblers and families. The service has been developed in conjuction with by Gamcare UK, the Department of Social Care and the island's Gambling Commission. Organisers said the Manx project, which has been given funding for 24 months, is dedicated to treating clients in a non-judgemental way. Problem Gambling Support worker Lyndsey Smart said: "Gambling can be a harmless, innocent and pleasurable activity for the majority but for a small percentage of the population occasional use can extend into an addiction. "Studies show that about 0.9% of people in the UK have a pathological problem and if figures in Isle of Man are in line with that, we could be looking at about 800 people with problems." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
