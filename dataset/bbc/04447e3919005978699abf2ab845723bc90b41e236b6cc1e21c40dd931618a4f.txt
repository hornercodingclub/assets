The Tim Stead Trust (TST) needed PS450,000 to purchase the property the artist created near Lauder. It suffered a major setback in November However, a number of major pledges and donations have now ensured its deal for The Steading can proceed. The TST said it was the "culmination of a roller-coaster journey" for the fundraising campaign which started over a year ago. It had looked as if that might be unsuccessful when The National Heritage Memorial Fund declined to award a major purchase grant. A benefactor "stepped up" shortly afterwards to offer match funding of up to PS250,000. More donations followed and a Crowdfunder campaign completed the package needed to buy the house. The trust has ambitious plans to develop The Steading as a major international centre for "wood culture" focussed on "education and creativity". Nichola Fletcher, who chairs the TST, said: "We are overwhelmed by the speed of this response, and with the enthusiasm that our project has sparked. "We are so grateful to our supporters, who have given so generously." She stressed that further fundraising would now be needed to support restoration work and their plans to develop the building. Mr Stead's widow, Maggy, who is selling the house, said: "It is a huge relief to me to know that my Tim's work will now be preserved and used in such a creative way. "He would have loved that." His son, Sam, who is also a trustee said it was "fantastic" the deal to buy the house could now go ahead. "The amazing support from friends and fans of my father's work has been truly heart-warming," he said. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
