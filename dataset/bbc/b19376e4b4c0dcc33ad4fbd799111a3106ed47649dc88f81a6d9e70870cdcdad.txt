People are speculating online about the private conversations between the pair as they prepare to hand over to President-elect Donald Trump and Vice-President-elect Mike Pence. These internet memes have taken off since the US election on 8 November. Most of them feature Biden plotting practical jokes on Trump, with Obama desperately trying to hold him back. Some play on the theme of a certain practical-joke laden, madcap comedy film from 1990. Or just have Joe Biden being silly.

Other people are looking to the future. While some are striking a more emotional tone with their memes. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
