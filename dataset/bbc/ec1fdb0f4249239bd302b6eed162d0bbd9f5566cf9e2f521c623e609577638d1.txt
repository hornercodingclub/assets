Some in the small rural East Midlands county have boasted of its from the American fast food giant. But at a meeting on Tuesday councillors approved the application for a drive-thru on the outskirts of Oakham. McDonald's said it was "delighted" at the decision. The company said the plans had a "great reception" and would create "at least 65 new jobs for local people". Before the meeting, Rutland County Council received 23 representations of support and 55 objections for the restaurant off Lands End Way. Charlie Pallett, who runs a blog about Rutland, said: "Our high streets are scattered with wonderful independents that offer something unique... I think we don't need a McDonald's. "Our county is the last one in England without one. I think that is really special." But many supported the plans, arguing the town "needs" more employment and entertainment for young people. Chris Goodchild told BBC East Midlands Today: "I'm all for it. I think it's a load of nonsense we haven't got one already. "The high street is full of charity shops and coffee bars, so what's the problem?" Rutland resident Ella Peters added: "I think it is a positive thing in regards to bringing new jobs but I don't believe it is a good idea to bring fast food - it is not very good for children. "I think it is better to support local compared to the big nationals." Council officers had for the restaurant be approved with 27 conditions, including the walls and roof should not be built until the details of materials and colours have been agreed with the authority. Other conditions include trees should be protected and the restaurant should not open until a litter management plan has been approved by the council.
