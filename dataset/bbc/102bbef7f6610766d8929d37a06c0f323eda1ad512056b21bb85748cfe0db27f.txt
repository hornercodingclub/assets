The wooden Petals from Heaven sculpture was unveiled in a ceremony at Redan Road Cemetery in Aldershot on Tuesday 15 October. It was discovered on Monday evening, apparently kicked from its fixings with the carving removed from the top. Borough councillor Gaynor Austin said it was "saddening and sickening." The Petals from Heaven sculpture was commissioned by Angela Roberts, from Aldershot, who lost a stillborn twin daughter more than 30 years ago. She has since campaigned for birth and death certificates to be issued for stillborn children. Ms Austin, councillor for North Town at Aldershot Borough Council, said the damage had been reported to police. She said: "It's just very saddening and sickening that anybody would do that. Angela put so much of her time, money and emotion into it. "For months we have been planning it and finding the appropriate place. The spot is actually the site of some un-named babies' graves. "It's just mindless. It makes us wonder what goes through people's heads." A crowdfunding appeal to replace the sculpture with a granite memorial stone has been launched. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
