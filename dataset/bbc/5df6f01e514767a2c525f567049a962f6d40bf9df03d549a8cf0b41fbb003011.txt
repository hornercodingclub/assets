Silent Night was chosen by the Church in Wales for people to sing at 19:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. The Reverend Kevin Ellis, vicar of Bro Eleth parish on Anglesey, said the song is a "simple and effective way" to tell the Christmas story. Religious services are still open to the public under Wales' level 4 rules. However, under the new restrictions, the Welsh Government has advised people to avoid congregating with others who they do not live with. Mr Ellis said: "A carol for Wales will hopefully, in the strangest of times and a single moment, bring people together, even though we are apart." He said singing the carol helps to "focus on the fragility and gift of life". The Church in Wales said was chosen because it is neither English nor Welsh in origin; it was written in Austria and is known in many languages. The Reverend Rebecca Sparey-Taylor, priest-in-charge in the Denbigh mission area, who also organised the initiative, said it is "comforting to know we can still unit with others" through song amid a pandemic and restrictions. "It's about celebrating Christmas in a traditional way, raising our voices across our villages and towns to spread joy and peace across Wales and beyond," she said. The Bishop of Bangor, Andy John said the song "speaks of something strong and bright in hard times". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
