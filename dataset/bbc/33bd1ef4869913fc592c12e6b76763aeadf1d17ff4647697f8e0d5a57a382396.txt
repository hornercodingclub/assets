Castle Street and Westgate Street will be changed to single-lane traffic, with new cycle lanes proposed. Cardiff Bus will also replace its oldest and most polluting vehicles with electric buses. An earlier idea to charge motorists to enter a "clean air" zone in the city centre was dropped in March. The council's Labour leaders concluded such a charge would penalise the owners of older cars and simply divert pollution to other parts of the city. Cabinet members backed the revamped scheme on Thursday. Conservative group leader Adrian Robson raised concerns that the plan may cause congestion in parts of the city.

There needs to be more education." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
