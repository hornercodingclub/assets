Officers were deployed in Chester on Monday amid concerns about the men, who were dressed in combat clothing. However, they turned out to be a pair of war history enthusiasts, Cheshire Police said. Their weapons, which included several American guns commonly used in the conflict, were deactivated.

They were initially thought to have been masquerading as Home Guard volunteers. The Home Guard was a reserve force of volunteers made up of people who were too old or otherwise ineligible to join the armed forces. They were famously portrayed in the BBC sitcom Dad's Army, which ran from 1968 to 1977. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
