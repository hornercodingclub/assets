Prince Isaac Walker, 32, assaulted the 36-year-old woman at Homerton Hospital in Clapton on Thursday morning. Walker, of no fixed address, was sentenced to 26 weeks in prison at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Friday. Minister for Care, Helen Whately, said violence against NHS staff would not be tolerated. She added she was "horrified to hear" of the "senseless attack". "Violence against our dedicated NHS staff is utterly abhorrent and will not be tolerated," she said. "The NHS is working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the police to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice and face the full force of the law." Between 1 April and 30 September, more than 1,600 coronavirus-related crimes have been recorded, according to the CPS. It includes police officers being "coughed and spat on" and others being "kicked, bitten and hit with heavy objects", the CPS said. PC Kyri Soupashis described the assault as a "needlessly vicious attack". He added: "I hope that the sentence handed down brings the victim a measure of satisfaction and that she is able to recover from what was a very frightening experience. "There is no justification for assaulting the people who devote their working lives to helping and protecting others, something that Walker will have time to reflect on as he serves his sentence." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
