The show, which starred Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory and Sam Neill, attracted audiences of about 2.4 million but also received criticism for some of the cast's "dodgy" West Midlands accents. Birmingham crime author RJ Ellory is a fan of the show and welcomed the decision to cast Birmingham people. The auditions will take place in Birmingham on Saturday. The programme takes its name from a 19th Century Birmingham gang, who wore flat caps with razor blades hidden in the peaks. Mr Ellory said: "I can't remember the last time an original television drama was set in Birmingham. "Peaky Blinders had superb production values. "It feels a bit nit-picky to say some of the accents were a little bit dodgy. "But the fact the BBC is interested in putting local people in there is fantastic." In making their appeal, the programme makers said: "We are appealing for local people from Birmingham for a number of roles in the new series." They said they were looking for white men aged between 13 and 19 and mixed-race men aged between 15 and 17. The open casting event will take place at 16 Minerva Works, 158 Fazeley Street between 11:00 and 15:00 GMT.
