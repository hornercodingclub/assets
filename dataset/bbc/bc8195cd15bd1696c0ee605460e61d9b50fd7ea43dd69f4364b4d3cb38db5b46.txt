The writers both spent a period of time living in the city, which features in two of Charlotte's novels. The square will be renamed Place des Soeurs Bronte/Zusters Bronteplein in honour of the 19th Century novelists. The tribute is part of the "feminisation" of street names in the neighbourhood of Koekelberg. Helen MacEwan, author of The Brontes in Brussels, said: "The Bronte square will be the first step in this initiative. "In Koekelberg, the sisters are thus set to be pioneers in the 21st Century as they were in the 19th." In 1842, Charlotte and Emily left Haworth in West Yorkshire for Brussels in order to improve their French so as to be able to teach the language better. Brussels went on to be the inspiration for the city of Villette in Charlotte's novel of the same name. Villette contains reworked material from an earlier novel, The Professor, which was published posthumously. The school in Brussels where Charlotte and Emily studied has since been demolished, with an arts centre now standing in its place. There is a plaque there commemorating the sisters' stay, however the Brussels Bronte Group has spent years pushing for a more prominent tribute. The pedestrianised square - which is being created at the end of Rue des Braves/Dapperenstraat - will house a complex including a library. As is customary, it will have both French and Dutch names as both are official languages in Belgium. There is already a small square in the heart of the city named Jo Cox. yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
