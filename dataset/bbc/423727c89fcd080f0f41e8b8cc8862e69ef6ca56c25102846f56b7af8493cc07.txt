But his life today is a far cry from his humble upbringings. Born in 1952, Sir Jim Ratcliffe grew up in a council house in Greater Manchester, attending grammar school before studying chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham. After graduating, he joined Esso before gaining business experience at a US private equity group. But his big break came in 1998 when he founded Ineos - a petrochemical company now with a turnover of PS48bn and sites across 26 countries. His own personal fortune - an estimated PS21bn - led him to reach the number one spot of the 2018 UK Sunday Times rich list. In recent years Sir Jim - knighted for his services to business - has continued to hit the headlines, largely for unconventional business moves. In 2018, Ineos bought Belstaff, the luxury motorcycle clothing maker and became the sponsor of the British professional cycle team formerly called Team Sky. The company also announced plans to build a new off-road vehicle based on the Land Rover Defender, which was discontinued in 2016. Sir Jim - a keen Brexiteer - is a known supporter of British brands and businesses, describing Britain as a "very creative nation, hard-working". But perhaps this latest move is also down to his taste for adventure. He is funding Kenyan athlete Eliud Kipchoge's bid to break the two-hour marathon threshold this October . He is also a keen amateur cyclist and recently spent five weeks motorbiking in the Andes. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
