Council-run care provider SB Cares said it had "robust" plans in place to deal with the situation at Dovecot Court in Peebles. Sixteen tenants and 12 members of staff have tested positive. Visiting was suspended at the site earlier this month when the outbreak was first reported. SB Cares, which provides services at the 37-flat development tailored for elderly people, said it had measures in place in order to "safely support" all tenants. Jen Holland, chief operating officer, said there was no impact on any of its other services in the area. Eildon Housing, which owns the development, said it was working "extremely closely" with its partners in response to the outbreak and was providing tenants with any support needed at a "challenging time". The region's director of public health said that while the level of infections in the Borders remained low compared with other areas it was essential for people to remain "vigilant" and follow health advice. The outbreak was raised at the Scottish government's national daily coronavirus briefing by a reporter who pointed out that National clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he was aware of the outbreak and "layers of support" were in place. "We continue to look after that home and those in it," he added. "We have no reason to believe that this virus, remember, is anybody's fault so trying to find a provider to blame is not really helpful. "What we want to do is support those providers, using our best public health expertise that we possibly can, to get that home Covid-free just as quickly as we can." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
