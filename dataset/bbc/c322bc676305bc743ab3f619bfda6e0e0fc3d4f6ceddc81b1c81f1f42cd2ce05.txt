The 31-year-old has made raising awareness about HIV and Aids a major element of his public work. There are more than 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK.

The negative result was indicated by a blue spot seen in the tray. However, if two spots had appeared he would have needed further tests to confirm if he was HIV-positive. The procedure was carried out by Robert Palmer, a lead health adviser and psychosexual counsellor, who said the prince was "anxious". Asked about the significance of a member of the Royal Family getting tested for HIV, Mr Palmer added: "It means this is a test for everybody - it doesn't matter who you are, it's a good idea to have an HIV test."
