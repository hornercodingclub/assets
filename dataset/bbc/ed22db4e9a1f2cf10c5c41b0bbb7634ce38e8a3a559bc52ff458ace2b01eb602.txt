The book, Livingstone's Missionary Travels in South Africa, was once owned by the explorer and pioneering medic. The signed 1857 edition was bought by Eddie Davies, 67, at a car boot sale in Carmarthen seven years ago. He said selling the book at auction on Friday was like "winning the lottery". Recalling his lucky find, Mr Davies said: "It's a one-off. I don't think it'll happen again. "When I saw that it was signed by a famous person I knew it would be worth something. "My only regret is there were a lot of old books in a cardboard box at that car boot sale and I didn't look at them. "I check all the books at sales now." Cardiff Auctioneer Ben Rogers Jones, of Rogers Jones & Co, confirmed the "rare book" had a guide price of PS1,000 to PS1,500. He said: "It is a real privilege to be able to turn the same pages as the great man in the knowledge that Livingstone owned the volume himself before gifting it to a friend." Published by John Murray, the volume covers every detail of the Scottish explorer's journey. Dr Livingstone travelled across uncharted Africa as a missionary doctor and explorer between 1841 and 1856. The book described his journeys across the Kalahari desert, up the Zambezi River and his naming of the largest waterfall in the world the Victoria Falls on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. He returned to Britain a national hero and published his best-selling book in 1857. The book being auctioned has a personal inscription from Livingstone to a Major General Charles Murray May. The message, dated London, 29 October, 1857, reads: "With the kindest remembrances of his much obliged and attached friend David Livingstone". The bound volume covers 32 chapters and 47 illustrations and details Dr Livingstone's 16 years of research in Africa.
