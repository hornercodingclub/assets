Some people there have dealt with their third bout of flooding in 12 months and three families were rescued by boat in Greyfriars Avenue, Hereford. Flood barriers have been put up to their fullest height in Bewdley in Worcestershire. The River Severn is expected to peak there on Saturday. A number of residents, such as Gerald Timmins, have not been able to return to their home since last year's floods. Returning on Friday to try to protect his home, Mr Timmins stated he was "anxious" and "devastated". He added: "The builders have been in putting it back to what it was. I'm trying to put the barriers up again now at the doors and things, so (it's) desperate stakes isn't it really?" Twenty flood warnings had earlier been in place in the two counties, but only one remained on Friday evening on the River Wye in Herefordshire, from Hereford to Ross-on-Wye. Seven were still in place on the Severn in Worcestershire. In Bewdley, the Environment Agency has been expecting river levels similar to those last February. In 2020, the Severn became so swollen with water it poured over the top of defences. The agency's Dave Throup said it had put up the "really big barriers" in the expectation of water peaking on Saturday, albeit at a level slightly lower than February's height. Worcester City Council said all car parks near to the Severn had been flooded. On Thursday the flood warden on Greyfriars Avenue in Hereford, Colin Taylor, said of 28 houses, eight were flooded. Asked about the impact of Covid-19, he said spaces had been found in hotels.
