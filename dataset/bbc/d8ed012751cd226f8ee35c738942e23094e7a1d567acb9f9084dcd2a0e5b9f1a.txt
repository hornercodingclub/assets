Rhondda Cynon Taf council wants to shut several homes in order to build five new facilities and provide more complex care for up to 300 more people. Plans involve building apartment blocks for elderly residents, while phasing out the county's five day care centres. Cabinet member Geraint Hopkins said the change was "the right thing to do".

Residents will be able to have their say during the consultation from Monday until 8 April.
