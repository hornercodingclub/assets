North Wales Police said the light aircraft was flying from Caernarfon Airport to the Great Orme, Llandudno, and back on Monday . The force added there were no other passengers and officers were supporting the missing pilot's family. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the search has resumed around Puffin Island, near Penmon, Anglesey. A plane carrying a sonar technology camera is searching the area as well as a lifeboat, helicopter and coastguard teams on foot. Bangor University's research ship, Prince Madog, has also assisted in the search. Local councillor Lewis Davies said the weather conditions at the time the plane vanished were good. "It's hard to know what happened because the weather was perfect," he said. "It's very calm and clear today, which will help the search, but its very worrying for the family of the missing pilot." HM Coastguard said it received a call for assistance shortly before 12:50 GMT on Monday. A spokesman said the search was launched after a report an aircraft had disappeared from radar contact, two miles north east of Penmon. Rescue teams from Llandudno, Bangor, Penmon, Moelfre and Cemaes as well as the HM Coastguard fixed wing aircraft are searching the area along with North Wales Police. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch also said it had sent a team to investigate an accident involving a light aircraft near Beaumaris. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
