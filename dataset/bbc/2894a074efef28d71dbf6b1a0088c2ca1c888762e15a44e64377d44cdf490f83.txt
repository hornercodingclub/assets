The government's "action plan" includes a commitment to produce 75% of the island's electricity from renewable sources by 2035. Interest from the private sector in projects to construct on and offshore wind turbines will be sought this year. Chief minister Howard Quayle said the plans needed "buy-in from everyone" on the island. The proposals are part of a plan to reduce the Isle of Man's carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.

A ban on all peat cutting will also be introduced. Mr Quayle said everyone should take responsibility for their carbon footprint.

At least PS10m will be earmarked for the first phase in the 2020-21 Isle of Man budget. , which would enshrine many of the measures in law, will be brought forward in June.
