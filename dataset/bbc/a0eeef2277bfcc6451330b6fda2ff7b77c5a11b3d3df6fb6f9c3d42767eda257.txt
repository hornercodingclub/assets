Katy Bourne made the decision after members of an independent audit committee criticised the investment. Committee member Mike Heap said: "Lending money to Qatar does seem to jar with everything we say about equality, diversity and how we like to go about our business." In 2019, PS20m was invested in Qatar. The PS6m pulled now represents more than half of the PCC's PS11.4m investments as of March 31, the reported. The year before, the total investment figure was PS46.5m, with just under half going to Qatar. The decision comes after a report from human rights group by unscrupulous employers and were not being paid for their work in 2019. As well as Qatar's record with labour laws, its attitude to LGBQT+ people was also questioned by the committee. Mr Heap said: "Lending money to a country that still outlaws homosexuality is something we should probably look to trade out of." Mrs Bourne said she shared those concerns and added: "Human rights observers say, whilst progress is being made, there is still a long way to go. "I will be withdrawing our investment in Qatar and I have asked for a review across our investment portfolio." The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
