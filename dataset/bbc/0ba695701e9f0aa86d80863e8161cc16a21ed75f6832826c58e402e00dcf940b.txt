At Leicester Crown Court, Jack Tebbutt, 20, of Central Avenue, Wigston, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is due to be sentenced on Tuesday. At an earlier hearing Tebbutt also admitted one count of burglary and a further charge of perverting the course of justice. Police said Mr Staff was in the house with his 77-year-old brother when he found Tebbutt in the hallway. He called out to his brother but Tebbutt pushed passed him, causing him to fall to the floor where he lay injured. Tebbutt stepped over him and stole a quantity of cash before fleeing the scene, officers said. An 18-year-old woman also pleaded guilty to one count of perverting the course of justice related to the case at a hearing last year. She will be sentenced at a later date, police said. Mr Staff's family had described him as a "gentle man" who was no threat to anyone.
