North Wales Police said one of several trail cameras photographed the car leaving Clocaenog Forest. The 15,000 acre (6,000 hectare) forest near Ruthin lies in Conwy and Denbighshire and is home to a red squirrel population. The force said in a social media post that it would be "calling" on the driver soon. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
