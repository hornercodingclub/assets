The Tun Liffey had to be rescued after grounding close to Magilligan Point at the mouth of Lough Foyle about 09:10 BST on Tuesday. It had been en-route to the Welsh port of Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire. The Dutch-owned tanker has been returned to Foyle Port. "The ship has been brought back to Foyle Port to undergo checks," a spokesman for the port told BBC News NI. Several tugs from the port had responded to the ship captain's request for help on Tuesday morning, he added. The tugs "managed the situation to re-float the tanker which was carried out successfully in a short space of time," he said. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
