Stena Line said the ferry had been deep-cleaned but port officials still needed to clear it to resume service. Paul Grant, trade director for Stena Line, said local health authorities had "given us approval" to depart at 22:00 GMT on Thursday, but "the final decision rests" with maritime authorities once replacement crew are onboard. "Our main focus now is on the wellbeing of our crew onboard the Stena Edda," Mr Grant said. All 322 passengers that were stranded overnight on the ferry disembarked on Wednesday. Stena Line said they had also temporarily introduced another freight vessel to the Birkenhead-Belfast route as a result. "Freight levels on the Irish Sea are currently very high due to stockpiling before Brexit," Mr Grant said.
