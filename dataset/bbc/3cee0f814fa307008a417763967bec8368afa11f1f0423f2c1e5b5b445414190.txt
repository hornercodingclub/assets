In February, in a case aimed at proving he fathered a love child in the 1960s. A court in Brussels ordered the 84-year-old ex-monarch to provide a saliva sample in three months or risk being presumed to be the father of Delphine Boel, 50. The ex-king denies the paternity claim. His lawyer, Guy Hiernaux, told reporters that he believed the former monarch would "submit to this test, since he has the guarantee that it will remain confidential". "It depends on him," said another lawyer, Alain Berenboom. Rumours the king had an illegitimate child first emerged in 1999 in an unauthorised biography about his wife. The allegation prompted a royal scandal and enduring media gossip in Belgium. Ms Boel first alleged on the record that King Albert was her biological father during a 2005 interview. Her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, has claimed the two had an affair between 1966 and 1984 when he was still Prince Albert of Liege. However, following his older brother's death in 1993 at 62, King Albert unexpectedly came to the throne. He held the position until July 2013, when he announced his abdication - citing ill health - and was replaced by his son, Philippe. He is said to receive an annual income of about EUR1m. Shortly after, Ms Boel opened court proceedings to prove her paternity, provoking speculation the scandal had influenced the move. Earlier this year, he refused to fulfil a 2018 court order to undergo DNA testing and launched an appeal. A court had initially set a three-month limit for him to provide a saliva sample for testing - saying that without it, Ms Boel would be assumed to be his daughter and be eligible for any inheritance. Belgium has a constitutional monarchy in which the king plays a largely ceremonial role. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
