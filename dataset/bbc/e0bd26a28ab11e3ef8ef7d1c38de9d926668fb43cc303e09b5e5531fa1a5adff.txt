Tim Hartill, 30, from Brierley Hill, was told he may not regain any movement in his left side after his illness. But he now hopes to be able to walk by the end of the year. He has so far raised more than PS2,900 for the Queen Elizabeth and Moseley Hall hospitals in Birmingham. Mr Hartill fell ill a day after his 29th birthday in March 2019, and underwent emergency surgery. While in critical care at the QE Hospital, Mr Hartill was also found to have endocarditis and needed a replacement heart valve, requiring further surgery. His wife, Sarah, said it was a "very difficult" few weeks. He then spent four months' rehabilitation in Moseley Hall Hospital, before returning home in October, but still requires 24-hour care. Ongoing physiotherapy has allowed him to regain the use of his left leg and some movement in his left arm. "I can straighten my leg, have been doing standing practice and I did four five last week," He said. "It is hard but he is trying," said Mrs Hartill. "It is lots of little steps but we are getting all there slowly. Following his treatment, he said he "wanted to say thank you" to the "heroes" who cared for him. Together with his team of friends, they hope to cover the equivalent of Land's End to John O'Groats and back. Mr Hartill is completing his sessions on a static bike, with friends also running and walking to contribute to the total miles covered. "It is tiring at times, but I have enjoyed it," he said. They hope to finish by 30 June. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
