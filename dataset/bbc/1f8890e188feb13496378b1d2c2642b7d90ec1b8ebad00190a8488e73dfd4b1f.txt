The athletic reptile's survival instinct kicked in when fire broke out at its owner's home in Whitworth Avenue, Corby, on Wednesday night. As crews battled the flames, the iguana leapt to the safety of a firefighter's head, Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service said. A spokeswoman said the crew member did not realise it was there, and the pet was carried away unscathed. It was "a very unique incident - one that we have never dealt with before", she said. "The fireman... didn't realise the iguana had climbed on top of him at first as he initially thought it was a colleague touching his helmet. "What a surprise he then had to find this iguana chilling on his head, eager to escape the burning building."
