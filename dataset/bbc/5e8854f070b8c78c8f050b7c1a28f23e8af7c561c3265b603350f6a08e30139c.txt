Nerijus Jankauskas, of no fixed abode, appeared via videolink at Belfast Magistrates' Court on six charges including being concerned in the supply of heroin. A police officer told the court he believed he could connect Mr Jankauskas to the charges. He was refused bail by the judge. Mr Jankauskas has been charged with driving with excess alcohol in the vicinity of the Ormeau Road in Belfast on 26 August, 2020, and of driving without insurance and a licence. He also faces charges on the same date of possessing criminal property, conspiring with others to supply heroin, and of being concerned in the supply of the Class A drug. A bail application was launched on behalf of the Lithuanian national, but was objected to by the prosecution on the grounds Mr Jankauskas was liable to commit further offences, and may try to flee the jurisdiction. Resident District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused to release him on bail on those two grounds, and remanded him into Maghaberry prison. The case was listed to appear again at the same court on 25 September.
