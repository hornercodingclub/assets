Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, of Solihull, died in hospital on 17 June after he was found injured at his home in Cranmore Road, Shirley. Arthur's father, Thomas Hughes, 27, and his partner Emma Tustin, 31, of the same address, denied murder at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. They were both remanded in custody and are awaiting a trial date. The couple were originally charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, but were charged with murder on 17 December last year. They also deny charges of assault, ill treatment and neglect or abandonment of a child. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
