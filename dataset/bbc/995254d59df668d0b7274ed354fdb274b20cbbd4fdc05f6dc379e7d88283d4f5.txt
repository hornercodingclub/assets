Oscar Montgomery, 17, was last seen near Church Ope Cove, Portland, on Wednesday at about 17:00 BST. Helicopters from the coastguard, the Royal Navy and police - along with RNLI lifeboats and two navy warships - are involved in the search. Police said Oscar, who is from the Birmingham area, was wearing a wetsuit, black flippers and a black snorkel. He is described as white and of a slim muscular build with brown hair and a small slit in his left eyebrow. Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them. Wyke Coastguard said it had undertaken a shoreline and clifftop search of the west side of Portland, but was stood down shortly after 14:00 BST. It described it as an "arduous and very difficult area to search" but carried out in "very favourable conditions", mostly on foot. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said its searches were ongoing. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
