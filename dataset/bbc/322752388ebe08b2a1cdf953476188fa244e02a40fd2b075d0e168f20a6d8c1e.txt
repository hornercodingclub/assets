Police were called at about 05:20 BST following reports of a Ford Fiesta leaving the northbound carriageway between junctions 9 and 11. Police said as a lorry parked behind the Fiesta to offer help, a second lorry crashed into the first one. Highways England (HE) reported a vehicle on fire. Details of any casualties were not disclosed. Farmer Ray Knight, who lives near to the M5, said he heard "a great big bang" at about 05:40 BST when he was feeding his cattle. "I looked outside, didn't know what it was so carried on as normal and then a few minutes later, there was a second one." Mr Knight said his son said "there's something strange going on" and mentioned "black smoke billowing up in the distance". "Ten minutes later we heard a third one [bang] and by that point you could see the black smoke and there was a glow in the sky, which I presume was a fire," Mr Knight added. The crash happened on a stretch of the motorway near Tewkesbury and Gloucester. Both carriageways between junctions 9 and 11 were affected. HE said the southbound lanes between junctions 9 and 11 had reopened "with a lane-three closure past the scene". It asked drivers to "please approach with care". It added the northbound lanes were expected to remain closed until "at least 6am" on Monday. It said the surface of the road had been "extensively damaged and must be resurfaced".
