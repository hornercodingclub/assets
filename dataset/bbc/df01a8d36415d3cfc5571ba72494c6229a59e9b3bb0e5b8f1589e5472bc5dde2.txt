Lucy Letby, 30, had previously been arrested in 2018 and 2019 as part of a probe into deaths at the neo-natal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital. The charges relate to baby deaths and non-fatal collapses at the hospital from June 2015 to June 2016. The judge at Warrington Magistrates' Court remanded her in custody to appear at Chester Crown Court on Friday. Ms Letby, of Arran Avenue, Hereford, is accused of murdering five baby boys who were named as; Cemlyn Bennett, Joseph Johnson, Barney Gee, Joseph Gelder and Eli Gelder and three girls named as Elsie McNall, Daisy Parkin and Maddie Freed. She is also accused of the attempted murder of Maddie Freed and another nine babies - five boys and four girls - whose identities may not be reported. Ms Letby spoke only to confirm her name, address and date of birth during the 10-minute hearing. Pascale Jones, prosecuting, told the court Ms Letby should be remanded into custody for her own safety. She said: "The crown will also stress there is substantial grounds to believe for her own protection this defendant should be remanded into custody." Ms Letby was rearrested by police on Tuesday as part of the investigation into the hospital and charged on Wednesday evening. A Cheshire Police investigation launched in May 2017 looked into the deaths of 17 babies and 16 non-fatal collapses at the Countess of Chester between March 2015 and July 2016. On Tuesday, the force said parents of all the babies involved were being kept fully updated on developments and were supported by officers.
