Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green in Reading, on Sunday. Two boys, aged 13 and 14, and a 13-year-old girl have been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. They have all been remanded in youth detention custody and a provisional trial date has been set for 21 June. The three teenagers, who cannot be identified because of their ages, had appeared at Reading Youth Court earlier on Thursday before the Crown Court hearing. The defendants only spoke at the youth court to confirm their names, ages and addresses. The court heard the girl has also been charged with perverting the course of justice. The Crown Court hearing was told a potential trial was estimated to last five or six weeks. Police were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack in fields on the boundary of Emmer Green and Caversham Heights. Olly was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement released on Wednesday, his family said: "An Olly-sized hole has been left in our hearts." His parents said their son was "an enigma", and having both autism and suspected pathological demand avoidance meant "he became a challenge we never shied away from". The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
