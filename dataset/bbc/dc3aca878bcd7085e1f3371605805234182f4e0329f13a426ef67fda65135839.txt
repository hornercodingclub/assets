The grant , set up in the wake of the lockdown. In May, Midland Railway - Butterley said it had become "victims to mindless vandalism". At the time it said: "These careless heart-breaking acts just make our job list even longer for when it is safe to return." Since then, more than PS5,000 has been donated to help with repairs.
