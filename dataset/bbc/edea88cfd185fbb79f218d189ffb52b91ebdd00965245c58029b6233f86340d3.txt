Only 4.4% of the tests in the latest week were processed by the privately run Lighthouse labs within a day. This was down from more than 10% two weeks ago. Nearly two-thirds of tests took three days to be processed. Lighthouse labs are a UK-wide network of specialist coronavirus laboratories and more than 70% of Welsh tests are processed in them. The rise in demand for tests and lab capacity has been blamed for the delay. Figures show more than 6,300 home tests were processed in the week up beginning 14 September, more than double the number in previous weeks. For the past two weeks figures have not been available to see how fast home tests are being turned around. These have now been published - although are still subject to revision - and show 4.4% of home tests were processed in a day. In the previous week, only 3.7% of tests were turned around in a day. The report, produced with NHS Wales and Public Health Wales figures, also said: The figures measure from the time a sample is recorded as being collected to the time the test result is authorised by the lab. They do not indicate how long it takes for people to get their results back.
