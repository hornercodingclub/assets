The lawyer had previously provided evidence about bribes being offered in return for lucrative contracts at SBM Offshore. The firm subsequently agreed a $240m (PS186m) settlement with the Dutch authorities. It paid a similar sum to settle a case in the US. SBM Offshore previously said it had not influenced the extradition request. Foreign Office minister Wendy Morton told MPs on 9 November: "We have no evidence that this arrest is linked to his whistleblowing or corruption."
