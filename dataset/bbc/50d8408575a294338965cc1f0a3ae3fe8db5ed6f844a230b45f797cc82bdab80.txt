It includes replacing current X-ray scanners with 3D technology, which could reduce queuing time for travellers, Guernsey Ports said. Until the new system is in place, the airport is required to carry out random hand searches of hold baggage. The first of two machines is expected to be up and running by the spring, bosses said. The current equipment, which has been in use since 2004, no longer meets the requirements of the UK Department for Transport. The airport previously said if it was not replaced regulators could require more manual searches to be carried out - resulting in longer check-in times, particularly at peak times. It is expected to cost up to PS12m from the States of Guernsey's capital reserve, as the airport is operated by the States Trading Supervisory Board through Guernsey Ports. Once up and running, the new machines will process luggage from the check-in desk to being loaded into the plane. Steve Langlois, from Guernsey Ports, said he was pleased to see significant investment in a "critical" part of the airport. He said: "As technology and standards improve, we want to ensure Guernsey's ports are equipped with the latest and most resilient technology." Mr Langlois added passengers travelling with checked luggage should allow extra time, in case their bag is randomly selected for a search. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
