As a result of collapsed embankments at Gotherington and Winchcombe, the 12 mile-long (19 km) Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway has faced disruptions for three years. The repairs were funded by an emergency appeal launched two years ago. Malcolm Temple, the railway's chairman, said he was "overwhelmed" by the generosity of people who contributed. He said: "Other railways have really rallied round to help and we'll never forget the very significant contribution that so many heritage railways have made." Mr Temple said one of the largest donations, PS70,000, was made by readers of Steam Railway magazine. A new portion of track has now been laid at 'chicken curve' which, following the repairs, means trains can now ferry passengers the full length of the line from Cheltenham racecourse to Laverton for the first time. About 70,000 passengers use the heritage line every year.
