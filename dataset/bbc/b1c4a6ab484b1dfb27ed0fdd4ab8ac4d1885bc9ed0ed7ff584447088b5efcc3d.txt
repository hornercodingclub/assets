The lorry, which had been travelling northbound, overturned onto the central reservation shortly after joining from the M4, at about 08:00 GMT. The motorway was shut between junctions 14 and 16, but the stretch of road between 15 and 16 has since reopened. The accident has caused delays and Highways England said the closure could be in place for the rest of the day. The lorry was the only vehicle involved in the accident, police said. "A significant closure is expected due to the investigation ongoing at the scene, the work required to recover the lorry from the carriageway and the emergency repair work to be carried out by Highways England," Insp Rachael Green said. "Diversions are in place. If your journey is essential, please try to avoid this area and use alternative routes." Any witnesses to the accident should contact Avon and Somerset Police.
