The bodies of Dr Saman Mir Sacharvi and Vian Mangrio, 14, were found after a fire at their home in Colne Road, Reedley on Thursday. The 49-year-old mother died "as a result of pressure to the neck", Lancashire Police said. Detectives have launched a double murder inquiry and appealed for anyone with information to contact them. In a social media post, Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust said: "Our thoughts are with Dr Sacharvi's family and friends at this terribly sad time. "She was a well-loved and well-liked colleague here at the Trust, described as 'brilliant' and a 'joy to work with'." A post-mortem examination also found Dr Sacharvi had been assaulted. Tests to establish Miss Mangrio's cause of death are under way. Police said the 14-year-old, who was a student at Marsden Heights School in Nelson, was found badly burnt inside the house. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
