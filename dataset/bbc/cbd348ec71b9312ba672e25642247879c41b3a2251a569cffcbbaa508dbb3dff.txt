He has now started in the reception class at Outwood Primary Academy in Ackworth, West Yorkshire. A crowdfunding appeal has raised money for Oliver to take part in a clinical trial for a vaccine in New York. His mum Laura said: "He was super excited this morning, as soon as he woke up he asked if he could go to school. "He got nervous when we arrived at school and had a little cry but he was so brave and went in with the teacher. "I can't wait to pick him up and hear all about his day." Oliver has received treatment for stage four neuroblastoma after being diagnosed with the rare cancer in January. He was at the end of April for a round of high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell treatment.

Oliver will spend two weeks at school before going for immunotherapy, which is the last phase in his treatment. Mrs Stephenson said: "I'm thrilled that he is well enough and also that it's landed at a point in his treatment that enables him to go." She said the school would be following government coronavirus guidelines and that "we're confident that they're doing everything safe".
