The company's head of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, said it had become harder to source such pelts ethically. He also included fur in the list, of which Chanel uses little. Although Chanel's designer Karl Lagerfeld insisted the move was made independently, animals rights groups hailed the decision. Peta said in an Instagram post "2018 is THE YEAR for designers coming out of the stone age".  A post shared by (@peta) on about the decision. "We did it because it's in the air, but it's not an air people imposed to us," Mr Lagerfeld said, although he noted "there was not much fur" in Chanel's work to begin with.

Other luxury brands have also stopped using fur but campaigners hope they will follow Chanel in abandoning exotic skins. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
