Joanna Borucka's body was found in a hostel on The Crescent in Southall on 18 December - more than a month after the 41-year-old was last seen alive. Homicide detectives say they urgently need to speak to Petras Zalynas. It is believed the 50-year-old Lithuanian national may now be in Germany. The Met said detectives were working with their European counterparts in an effort to locate Mr Zalynas. Det Ch Insp Wayne Jolley made a direct appeal to the Lithuanian community to help with the whereabouts of Mr Zalynas. He said: "It is thankfully very rare for a body to be found in these shocking circumstances. I know it makes the news of Joanna's death all the more difficult for those who were close to her. "Our investigation is progressing well. We have identified Petras Zalynas as a person who we need to speak to in order to find out what happened to Joanna. I'm confident there are people out there who may have seen Zalynas or who might know where he is. "I would urge them to come forward." An inquest into Polish national Ms Borucka's death was opened on 5 January at West London Coroner's Court and adjourned until the Met's criminal investigation has finished. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
