Police said they visited The Plough Inn in Cropwell Butler, Nottinghamshire, on Wednesday where they found the pub open. Officers returned a day later, fining the owners PS1,000 and a total of seven staff and customers PS200 each for the breach of coronavirus rules. The pub has been contacted for comment. The current lockdown in England means hospitality venues such as cafes, restaurants and with the exception of takeaway food. In addition to the fines, the pub on Main Street was served a prohibition notice, meaning food and drink cannot be served on the premises until further notice. Councillor Rob Inglis, from Rushcliffe Borough Council, said: "It is mindless, selfish and utterly irresponsible by all involved. "We know businesses are facing an unprecedented trading situation but so many here in Rushcliffe have adapted brilliantly to offer takeaway and delivery safely instead of having to resort to flouting the rules." eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
