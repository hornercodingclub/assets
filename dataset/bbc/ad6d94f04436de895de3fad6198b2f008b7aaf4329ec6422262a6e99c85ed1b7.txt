The man had fallen "part way down a cliff" between Boscastle and Crackington Haven in Cornwall on Sunday afternoon, a spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall Police said. Emergency services were called after a bicycle was found at the top of the cliffs and they spotted the injured man at the base of High Cliff. He was winched to safety and taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. The man's injuries are not thought to be life-threatening or life-changing. Other emergency services, including Bude RNLI lifeboat and a coastguard rescue helicopter, were also called. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
