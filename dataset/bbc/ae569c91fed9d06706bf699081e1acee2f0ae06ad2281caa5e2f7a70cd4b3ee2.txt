However, leader Elizabeth May said the manipulation was done without her knowledge and she was "completely shocked" to see it. The edited photo showed Ms May holding a plastic reusable cup with the Green Party logo and a metal straw. The party leader said that she had nothing to hide as she was using a compostable disposable cup. "My personal daily practice is to avoid single use plastic items 100% of the time," Ms May said in a statement. "I walk the talk every day. I hope that despite this misstep by well-meaning party staff (who hoped to brand the image with our logo), people can believe that in the original photo there is nothing I would have hidden," she added. The Green Party has committed itself to reducing plastic waste, including a ban on single-use plastics. Canadians go to the polls on 21 October in what will be Ms May's fourth general election. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
