Det Ch Insp Tim Brown praised the "fantastic proactive work" of the community officers who found the drugs. A force spokesman said no arrests had been made in connection with the find. He said officers believed the warehouse was being used as a "drugs distribution centre" and that "numerous boxes" filled with bags of cannabis were uncovered. He added that anyone with information about the warehouse or CCTV footage from the area should contact police.
