Rhondda Cynon Taf council bosses blamed rising costs and low use in Gelli, Maerdy and Williamstown. The local authority will keep one day centre open at Gilfach Goch, proving hot meals and activities to over-50s. The council is moving towards having community hubs offering a range of services under one roof. The council said it would cost PS500,000 to maintain the four buildings over the next five years, according to the . Plaid Cymru councillor Larraine Jones presented a petition and spoke against the Labour leadership's proposals, saying Gelli was one of the most deprived areas of Wales. "The council says it has no legal duty to provide day centres but it certainly has a moral duty," she said. "I ask cabinet to invest more energy and commitment to improving [the Gelli day centre] and the number of residents who use it will increase." Jack Harries, a Labour councillor for Maerdy, was disappointed at the closure of his local day centre at Teify House. "To say I am totally gutted is an understatement but I  understand the reasons why," he said. "When you lay the figures out this is money we can't possibly fathom." A report to councillors showed the net cost per meal served in the Maerdy day centre was PS21, and the building needed PS193,000 worth of repairs. Maureen Webber, deputy leader of the council, said the current buildings were "not fit for purpose" while the new community hubs would benefit people of all ages. "Nobody wants to close them but we want alternative provision that we can all go to and we can all enjoy," she said. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
