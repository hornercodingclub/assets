Lucy Letby was previously arrested in 2018 and 2019 as part of a probe into deaths at the neo-natal unit. Cheshire Police is investigating baby deaths and non-fatal collapses at the hospital between March 2015 and September 2016. Ms Letby, originally from Hereford, remains in custody. Police said a healthcare worker had been rearrested based on further information gathered by detectives. The investigation was "extremely challenging" but "very much active and ongoing", a force spokesman added. Det Insp Paul Hughes said: "Parents of all the babies have been kept fully updated on this latest development and they are continuing to be supported throughout the process by specially trained officers. "This is an extremely difficult time for all the families and it is important to remember that, at the heart of this, there are a number of bereaved families seeking answers as to what happened to their children." Detectives launched an investigation into baby deaths at the hospital in May 2017, which first focused on the deaths of 15 infants between June 2015 and June 2016. However the probe later widened to the deaths of 17 babies and 16 non-fatal collapses between March 2015 and July 2016. A spokesman for the Countess of Chester Hospital previously said it was "co-operating fully" with the investigation. The Russian leader says his first call with the new US president was "business-like and frank". 15 sayings from around the world (c) 2021 BBC.
