The remains, unearthed in 2017, were found to be those of Abbot John of Wheathampstead, who died in 1465. Reconstructed by university experts, it is claimed to be the first face of a 15th Century figure to be revealed in this way . Dean Dr Jeffrey John said the abbot had been brought "startlingly to life". Dr John said the image "immediately invites us to read his character from his features". "He has an impish look, but also looks like a man who was not to be trifled with - as befits one of the most powerful ecclesiastical fixers of his day," he said. St Albans Cathedral stands on the site where Britain's first saint, St Alban, was martyred by the Romans and is the oldest place of continuous Christian worship in the country. Abbot John's burial site remained undiscovered for centuries, . His skeleton was unearthed along with three papal bulls - a type of public charter issued by a pontiff - that Pope Martin V had given him 40 years before, confirming the papal privileges he gained in 1423 - and providing the key to his identity. The reconstruction, funded by the Friends of St Albans Cathedral, was carried out by Prof Caroline Wilkinson from forensic reconstruction specialists FaceLab, based at Liverpool John Moores University. Prof James Clark from Exeter University, one of those who supervised the work, said it was the "first accurate representation of a monastic figure in England before 1500". Abbot John's body will be laid to rest again at St Albans Cathedral on a date yet to be confirmed.
