Sony said the rise in overall sales numbers was mostly due to a "significant increase" in its games and network services sales, "reflecting the contribution of the PlayStation 4."

Sony has also been struggling this year to turn around its television unit, which has been losing money due to competition from Asian rivals including Samsung Electronics.
